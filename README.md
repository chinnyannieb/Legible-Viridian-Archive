Legible-Viridian-Archive
========================

Archive of notes from the Viridian Design Movement, stripped of crap in order to improve their legibility.

Content is all originally from www.viridiandesign.org, home of Bruce Sterling's former Viridian Design Movement. Ironically the design of that site is awful, so I've gone ahead and stripped it all out, just adding some basic styles to make it readable, and a basic header to make it slightly more navigable.

It's all static html pages that have been touched up using site wide search & replace commands, so you will undoubtedly still find many horrible things lurking in the markup if you look for them.

If you wish to see this archive improved / fixed / enhanced or otherwise altered, feel free to submit your criticism in the form of a pull request.

All hail the Pope-Emperor.
