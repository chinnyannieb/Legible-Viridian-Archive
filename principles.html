<h1>Viridian Principles 1.0</h1>

<h2>A.  Futurist principles</h2>

<h3>"Eat What You Kill"</h3>

<blockquote>It's perfectly acceptable to supersede some time-honored 
tool or practice.  However, you should take pains to fully 
comprehend the thing you have rendered obsolescent.  You 
are removing some part, however modest, of the 
infrastructure of civilization.  You are destroying the 
work of previous designers; you should offer them the 
respect you yourself would hope for, under similar 
circumstances.   This is for your own good.   You can't 
comprehend your own accomplishment until you have fully 
internalized and understood the accomplishment that you 
are undoing.</blockquote>

<h3>"Avoid the Timeless, Embrace Decay"</h3>

<blockquote>Platonic visions of absolute reality, and Christian 
visions of eternity, are very unhealthy for bipedal 
mammals in a biosphere.   Nothing physical is eternal.
It's very  bad design to create some device which quickly 
ceases to function, while its useless components persist 
around us, ugly and dangerous.   Entropy deserves our 
respect and attention.  Entropic processes such as 
corrosion, rot, rust, degradation, delamination, and 
disintegration should be closely studied, harnessed for 
industrial use, and even aestheticized.</blockquote>

<h3>"Planned Evanescence"</h3>

<blockquote>"Planned Obsolescence" means that a product will be driven 
off the market, within a known time-frame, by some 
purported improvement.  The Viridian principle  of 
"Planned Evanescence" extends this practice by demanding 
that the product and all its physical traces should 
gracefully disintegrate and vanish entirely.</blockquote>

<h3>"The Future is History -- Be When You Are"</h3>

<blockquote>The future is not a stage set.  The past is not a sacred 
myth. The past and the future are this place at a 
different time.  The future is advancing upon you, and the 
past retreating, at a remorseless rate of one second per 
second.  You can seek understanding anywhere, but you can 
only act in the moment.  "You Own Modernity." It's easy to 
get transfixed by romantic ideas of historical 
inevitability: glamorous marches of progress, or gruesome 
congenital declines.  But your own epoch is your own 
problem.  If you call yourself "post" or "former," or 
"neo" or "retro,"  you are begging for someone else's 
troubles.</blockquote>

<h3>"History Accumulates"</h3>

<blockquote>The arrow of time moves only in one direction.   As long 
as civilization persists and  our records multiply, we 
have more and more history.   The compost of history is 
thicker  for us than it was for our predecessors -- and 
thinner than it will be for our descendants.  We need 
better ways to manage our increasing wealth of history.</blockquote>

<h2>B.  Moral Principles</h2>

<h3>"Look at the Underside First"</h3>

<blockquote>Legions of people are paid large sums to promote the 
positive aspects of commercially available products.
Very few people earn their daily bread by pointing out 
malfunctions, bugs, screw-ups, design failures, side-
effects and the whole sad galaxy of trade-offs and 
failings that are inherent in any technological artifact.  
To counteract this gross social imbalance, a wise designer 
and a wise critic will make it a matter of principle to 
look at the underside first.</blockquote>

<h3>"Design For Evil"</h3>

<blockquote>Any innocent product which becomes suddenly genocidal in 
the hands of a tyrant has been designed by a dangerous 
naif. Every design process is incomplete unless it takes 
into careful consideration what could be done with the 
product by a dictatorial megalomaniac in command of a 
national economy, a secret police, and a large army.</blockquote>

<h3>"Design for the Old"</h3>

<blockquote>The median age is advancing steadily around the world.  
The 21st century will have a historically unprecedented 
demographic structure.   Short of catastrophe and mass 
slaughter, we will never see the 20th century's youthful 
demographics again.   The senior members of society have 
their own ergonomics and anthropometrics.  If you don't 
design for them, you're designing for an ever-shrinking 
fraction of the world.</blockquote> 

<h3>"Superstition Isn't Inspiration"</h3>

<blockquote>Creative inspiration isn't a lab product, but it doesn't 
come from your fairy godmother, either.  There's no 
effective substitute for experimental verification and 
reproducible results.   A tarot deck can trigger strong 
feelings of creative insight, but it doesn't convey  
higher wisdom.  Like horoscopes and ouija boards, it uses 
suggestion to allow you to tell yourself a story that you 
already know.  Don't mistake mystic wish-fulfillment and 
the promptings of your unconscious for objective evidence.  
It's a breach of taste to imagine that the vagaries of 
your own imagination are more interesting than the world.</blockquote> 

<h2>C.  Political Principles</h2>

<h3>"Viridian Inactivism"</h3>

<blockquote>Activism is an attention hog, and very time and energy 
intensive.  A better approach is to find the things you 
are doing that intensify the problem, and just 
cease doing them.  Put in less overtime.  Sleep late.  
Have a nap after lunch.  Burn less midnight oil.  Park 
your car, turn off all the lights in your apartment, and 
go outside in the sunshine and read a book.   Spend an 
hour on your mascara if you feel like it.  Don't allow 
yourself to be spooked into Stakhanovite overdrive; seek 
command of your own life, and enjoy being yourself.</blockquote> 

<h3>"Do Less With Less"</h3>

<blockquote>We're altering the climate by burning too much fossil 
fuel.  We should struggle valiantly to find alternative 
sources of energy, but it's rather more gratifying to 
simply become less frenetic.  What exactly are we doing at 
the moment that is worth ruining the climate for?  Relax.</blockquote>

<h3>"There's No One So Green As the Dead"</h3>

<blockquote>Zealous moralistic arguments about who is more-Green-than-
thou are very counterproductive.  We're all adding to the 
global CO2 load as long as we continue to breathe.  Dead 
people are the ultimate Greens  (trumped only by people 
who never existed in the first place).  If you feel 
helpless with guilt because of your bad environmental 
habits, pause and think of the very brief time in which 
you employ the earth's resources, and the long, long eons 
in which you'll be just raw material again.</blockquote>

<h2>D.  Principles of the Avant-technogarde</h2>

<h3>"The Biological Isn't Logical"</h3>

<blockquote>Design tends to follow the leading technical products of 
its period; in an age of aviation, even pencil-sharpeners 
are streamlined.  Given this longstanding trend, the 
coming bio-genetic technical revolution should produce a 
biomorphic epoch in 21st century design.  But the living 
world was not designed by a teleological, rationalist, 
reductionist process.   The living world grew irrationally 
through non-systematic, genetic exploration of niche 
possibilities, pruned back by natural selection and 
occasional massive disasters.   So if you're building 
distributed networks, learn from crabgrass. </blockquote>  

<h3>"Augment Reality:  Aestheticize All Sensors"</h3>

<blockquote>From the age of desktop calculation, through the age of 
networking and bandwidth, computation/communication will 
progress toward omnipresent, on-chip sensors, the 
"intelligent environment" or "augmented reality."  While 
calculation is mathematical, and bandwidth is highly 
technical, sensors must interact with the human sensorium, 
and are therefore a strong aesthetic challenge.  Sensors, 
instrumentation, and mediated monitoring systems of all 
kinds are the next aesthetic frontier.</blockquote>

<h3>"Make the Invisible Visible"</h3>

<blockquote>Our primary advantage over previous generations of artists 
and graphic designers is that we can see much better than 
they could.   We can manipulate, store, create and analyze 
graphic imagery with historically unprecedented ease and 
power.   This trend should be recognized, advanced,  and 
artistically exploited.  Advances in instrumentation can 
be used to change the zeitgeist.  If carbon dioxide were 
blood-red, our skies would look ominous indeed.</blockquote>

<h3>"Less Mass, More Data"</h3>

<blockquote>Physical resources should be replaced with information 
when possible.  If you always know where something is, you 
don't have to chain it up.   If it can see stress coming 
and duck, it doesn't need to be sturdy.   If it pops up 
and vanishes repeatedly on signal, it doesn't have to take 
abuse.</blockquote>

<h3>"Tangible Cyberspace"</h3>

<blockquote>The obverse of "Less Mass, More Data" is "Tangible 
Cyberspace," introducing computer-generated artifacts and 
processes into the basic texture of the physical world.  
This transcends mere CAD-CAM, in that it seeks for a 
profound new interrelationship of the computational and 
the environmental.  We seek to make the screen permeable, 
and to turn "computers" into worldly, sensual entities.</blockquote>

<h3>"Seek the Biomorphic and the Transorganic"</h3>

<blockquote>"Nature" is over.  There's not a liter of seawater 
anywhere without its share of PCB and DDT, and an altered 
climate will reshuffle the ecological deck for every 
creature that breathes.  A 21st century avant-garde must 
deal with those consequences and thrive in that world.   
We have already painted flowers.  We want to know what a 
flower means when a flower has onboard processing, amped-
up genetics, and its own agenda.  Thus a central Viridian 
aesthetic dictum:  "A Rose is No Longer a Rose."</blockquote>

<h3>"Datamine Nature"</h3>

<blockquote>"Seeking Truth From Nature" was a rhetorical and 
ideological support of the Pre-Raphaelites and Art 
Nouveau.  It worked well twice and can work again.  Since 
our understanding of natural processes has advanced so 
hugely, there is a wealth of aesthetic novelty to be found 
in previously invisible aspects of nature, such as 
cellular metabolism, noninvasive medical imaging, 
hybridomas and chimeras, artificial life entities, and 
chemosynthetic life forms.</blockquote>

<h3>"Grow Complexity"</h3>

<blockquote>It is now absurdly simple to create graphic patterns of 
any level of busy-ness and complexity.  Without human 
esthetic intervention, this art is puerile and ugly.  A 
Viridian aesthetic looks for patterns that are both 
tasteful and previously impossible.</blockquote>

<h2>E.  Research Principles</h2>

<h3>"Walk Through the Walls of Knowledge Guilds"</h3>

<blockquote>The boundaries that separate art, science, medicine, 
literature, computation, engineering, and design and craft 
generally are not divinely ordained.  The most galling of 
these boundaries are socially generated entities meant to 
protect the power-interests of knowledge guilds.  This is 
not to say that that all research techniques are 
identical, or that their results are all equally valid 
under all circumstances: quantum physics isn't opera.  But 
there exists a sensibility that can serenely ignore 
intellectual turf war, and comprehend both physics and 
opera.  You won't be able to swing a grant or sing an aria 
by knocking politely at the stage door. They won't seat 
you at the  head of the table and slaughter the fatted 
calf. But you can take photographs, plant listening 
devices and leave.  If you choose, you can step outside 
the boundaries history makes for you.  You can walk 
through walls.</blockquote>


<blockquote><em>ADDENDUM:  We are looking for more Viridian principles, 
and improvements in the above formulations.  We are also 
searching for designed objects in today's environment that 
seem to be exemplars of some or all of these Viridian 
principles, so that we can trumpet them, and lavish praise 
upon them.  We are also looking hard for evil counter-
exemplars that violate our principles, so that we can lash 
them with critical scorn.  Please send your candidates to 
bruces@well.com.</em></blockquote>
