<P>Attention Conservation Notice: A rather standard piece
of pro-environmental Kyoto-style rhetoric, but,
peculiarly, it's coming from a sheik in a major oil-
exporting country.</P>

<P>"The Middle East is Setting an Environmental Example"
by Hamdan ibn Zayed al Nahyan</P>

<P>"Sheikh Hamdan is minister of state foreign affairs of the
United Arab Emirates and deputy chairman of Abu Dhabi's
Environmental Research and Wildlife Development Agency.
He contributed this comment to the International Herald
Tribune."</P>

<P>"ABU DHABI == the Middle East has special reason to pay
attention to global warming.  Many of the countries of the
region are low-lying and short of water.  We are under
threat from rising sea levels and desertification.</P>

<P>"By the end of this century, we are now told, sea levels
could rise by as much as 88 centimeters.  This could flood
not only coastal areas of the United Arab Emirates but
also much of the heavily populated Nile Delta in Egypt and
Euphrates river system in Iraq.</P>

<P>"Increasing desertification threatens much of our
agricultural land.  A rapidly rising population places
ever growing demands on our natural resources.</P>

<P>"Part of the answer to global warming is new technology,
from windup radios to CFC-free refrigerators to
desalinization plants.  But ultimately, it will take tough
policy decisions and the courage to follow through to
reverse the frightening threat to humanity's common
future.</P>

<P>"We are all in the same boat, and rich countries cannot
simply shrug their shoulders and say it is the poor
countries' end of the boat that is sinking. We must all
step up to our different responsibilities.</P>

<P>"In the United Arab Emirates we are still a developing
country, although we are blessed with the wealth bestowed
on us by our oil and gas reserves.  We need the funds in
order to develop, yet must at the same time take account
of the impact that this exploitation may have on global
warming.</P>

<P>"To conserve oil resources, we are examining the possible
uses of renewable sources of energy. (...) Results from
research into the capturing of clean energy from the sun
through a new generation of solar panels are encouraging.
Before long it will be possible for us to construct
buildings with photovoltaic panels that will generate most
of the buildings' energy requirements. (...)</P>

<P>"This week the environment ministers of 19 Arab countries
have been meeting in Abu Dhabi in an Environment 2001
conference, after adopting on Saturday a declaration which
seeks to lay down a strategy for sustainable use of
environmental resources throughout the Arab world for the
21st century.  The stakes are high for us, and for our
planet.  We shall try to play our part.  We pray that
others will do likewise."</P>
