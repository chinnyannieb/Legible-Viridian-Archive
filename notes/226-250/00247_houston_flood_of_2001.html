<P>Houston Swamped by Rains From Allison Remains
Updated: Sat, Jun 09 2:51 PM EDT</P>

<P>"HOUSTON (Reuters) == Massive rains from the remnants of
Tropical Storm Allison inundated Houston and southeastern
Texas on Saturday, forcing thousands of people from their
flooded homes and bringing the nation's fourth largest
city to a virtual standstill.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Parts of the city received 26 inches of rain in a
downpour that began on Friday afternoon and continued most
of the night, officials said. Since Allison struck on
Tuesday, 35 inches of rain have fallen, they said.
(((That's almost <STRONG>three feet.</STRONG>)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Texas Gov. Rick Perry declared a state of emergency
for Houston and 28 east Texas counties and authorized the
use of state equipment to help rescue stranded residents.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Mayor Lee Brown appeared stunned after surveying the
damage from a helicopter.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'It's unbelievable what's happening here. We have
problems all over the city, flooding all over downtown and
every other part of the city,' Brown told reporters.
(((Why do mayors always say stuff like that?)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(...) "Television reports showed vast sections of the
city under water that in some cases reached the rooftops
of homes or filled road underpasses to the brim. Stalled
cars and trucks could be seen floating in streets that
looked like rivers.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Every freeway in the city was closed due to high
water and creeks and bayous looked like vast lakes instead
of the small, meandering streams they usually are.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Officials said at least 3,000 homes and buildings had
been damaged and 17,000 families displaced. The Red Cross
opened shelters throughout the city to accommodate the
victims.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Harris County Judge Robert Eckels said he expected
the city has suffered 'hundreds of millions of dollars' in
damages.  (((Might be even bigger than Enron's profits!
Are you listening, Munich Re, Swiss Re? How long before
these weather damages are bigger than the oil industry?)))</P>

<A NAME="_helicopters_pluck_people_from_rooftops"> </A>
<p><strong>"HELICOPTERS PLUCK PEOPLE FROM ROOFTOPS</strong></p>

<P>"The U.S. Coast Guard was called in to help pluck people
from their rooftops with helicopters and to pump out a
critical AT&amp;T telephone switching center before rising
waters blew its circuits.  (((The first of many Wexelblat
Disasters raises its ugly head; phone switching center
blows out.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Continental Airlines, which is based in Houston, said
high water was keeping employees from getting to work,
forcing the nation's fifth largest air carrier to shut
down operations at its main hub, Houston Intercontinental
Airport.  (((Air transport blows out.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'We think today we'll end up canceling a thousand
flights,' spokesman Ned Walker told reporters. 'We're
going to suspend all of our operations at Intercontinental
Airport today.'
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Texas Medical Center, which with 13 hospitals is
one of the world's largest medical facilities, suffered
heavy flooding damage and was seeking to transfer patients
to hospitals in Austin and San Antonio, a spokesman said.
(((Health system blows out.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Allison brewed up suddenly in the Gulf of Mexico on
Tuesday and quickly came ashore, moving inland over
southeast Texas. It lost its 60 mph winds almost
immediately.  (((Very little warning.  Sinister little
thing, really.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(...)  "Parts of Louisiana received nearly two feet of
rain the past four days, causing officials to declare a
state of emergency in 21 of the state's 64 parishes. Gov.
Mike Foster activated 1,000 National Guardsmen to help
evacuate some of an estimated 1,100 families affected by
the storm.  (((Sorry, Cajuns, but at least you know how to
live in a swamp.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The National Weather Service said Houston could get
another 10 inches of rain on Saturday evening and raised
the specter that the remains of Allison could drift back
to the Gulf of Mexico and regain strength over its warm
waters."  (((Smacked twice by the same event?  It happened
to Paris in the Tempests of December 01999))).</P>

<P>"Two Die in Texas Floods</P>

<P>By MICHAEL GRACZYK, Associated Press Writer</P>

<P>"HOUSTON (AP) == Thousands of people were forced from
their homes or stranded on flooded freeways Saturday as
torrential rains from the remnants of Tropical Storm
Allison swamped Houston and Southeast Texas.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(((Houston Mayor)))Brown said an earlier estimate of
3,000 homes and business damages was 'very conservative.'
'Some complete subdivisions are flooding over,'he said.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Texas Medical Center was hit with power outages
because emergency generators were flooded. Some telephone
service was interrupted. The city's 911 service was
overwhelmed, and traffic signals were a mess.  ((((911
down, traffic signals down.))) Police Chief Clarence
Bradford said there were only a few reports of vandalism
or looting.  (((It's too wet to go outside and steal
stuff.))) (...)
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"President Bush on Saturday declared a 28-county
disaster area, ordering federal aid to supplement state
and local recovery efforts. Bush spent the weekend at his
Crawford ranch, about 175 miles northwest of Houston.
(((Is it too much to ask that a freak F3 tornado spins off
the edge of the storm and...  well, yeah, it is.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Stranded on highways along with vacationers and
residents, long-haul truckers == their rigs stalled and
damaged by flash floods == bunked in their cabs, brewed
coffee and aided motorists whose 'four-wheelers' sank or
floated in the rising water.  (((So much for the SUV
contingent.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'I came up on this little BMW two-seater, and this
executive guy grabbed his briefcase and what he could out
of his car and got in,' Oklahoma City truck driver Daniel
Hock said Saturday. 'That was the last we saw of the car.
He just bought it; it had 18,000 miles on it.'  (((Hardly
spewed any carbon at all, more's the pity...)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trucker James Wilson had to swim from his truck. His
trailer was floating on Interstate 10, straddling the
center and pinned against a railroad trestle. His cab was
nowhere in sight.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;'I tried to stay with it, but it was time to go,'
Wilson said. 'I ain't going to go down with the rig.'
(((Unlike the rest of us.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'As soon as we rescue one person and drop them off,
we get diverted to another case,' Coast Guard spokesman
Rob Wyman said.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Joining in the effort were military trucks big enough
to navigate through the deep water, said National Guard
spokesman Aaron Reed. ((("Khaki Green" to the rescue.  The
Army <STRONG>is</STRONG> the climate policy.)))  The guard also sent five
of its own helicopters to help.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The deluge Friday and Saturday was produced by the
lingering remnants of Allison, the Atlantic hurricane
season's first named storm, which blew ashore on the Texas
coast on Tuesday, then quickly dwindled but refused to
leave. Some rain gauges in Houston showed 24-hour rainfall
amounts topping 20 inches.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The effects of the storm extended beyond Texas. The
flooding disrupted access to an estimated 76,000 automated
teller machines in 22 states, said Julian Read, spokesman
for PULSE, a nonprofit electronic funds transfer network
of more than 2,600 banks.  (((Pulse System goes down.  A
Viridian newbie just sent me email asking what a
"Wexelblat Disaster" is. Well, it works like this:  you're
trying to fly out of Houston but the airport's down, so
you try to call home but you can't, then your rental car
drowns, so you go to get some cash to stay in a hotel on
dry land and wow, how come there's no cash?)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(((Now we start getting into the "Viridian Uncanny.")))
"Also in Louisiana, alligators agitated by the storm's
thunder, lightning and heavy rain wandered into
residential areas.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kathy Smith didn't believe her daughter had really
seen an alligator in their yard in LaPlace, La., until she
saw a neighbor trying to catch the critter Friday. 'I
said, 'You get him, and I'm about to call 911,' she said.
(((Hope 911's up and running.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trappers in Louisiana's St. John the Baptist and St.
Charles parishes captured 40 alligators during the week.
'I'll release them back into the swamps unless they are
big and aggressive,' said Richard Roussel IV, an alligator
nuisance control officer for St. John Parish.  (((Pure
savoir faire those Louisianans; they really are the
bellwether Greenhouse state.)))</P>

<P>"Catastrophic flooding forces state of emergency for area</P>

<P><BR>
"Houston-area residents braced for the possibility of more
rains tonight, which could worsen the catastrophic
flooding that brought the region to a near-standstill and
left nearly 17,000 people homeless.</P>

<P>"And local officials, weary from marathon rescue and
relief efforts, blanched at the possibility that what
remains of Tropical Storm Allison is headed toward the
warm Gulf of Mexico waters where it could reorganize and
restrengthen.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Across Harris County, as many as 21,000 homes are
thought to be without power, phones and water, said County
Judge Robert Eckels. About 5,000 homes are flooded in the
county.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As many as 34,000 Reliant Energy/HL&amp;P customers,
including hospitals, are without power this afternoon, a
Reliant spokeswoman said. (((Power network down.  Send
some voltage over, California!)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roughly 17,000 people were going to need some type of
temporary shelter and county officials ordered the Reliant
Astrohall opened for that purpose. Schools, churches and
other public facilities were also being opened as
shelters. ((("Reliant Astrohall" full of refugees.  Nice
choice of corporate sponsors there.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(...) "Early today, Gov. Rick Perry declared a state of
emergency in the Houston area and 28 Southeast Texas
counties. Perry will visit the Houston area Sunday to get
a first-hand aerial view of the devastation from severe
flooding.</P>

<P>(...) "City Public Works crews continued to rescue
residents around flooded areas today. About 200 people had
been picked up and dropped off at shelters around the
city, Ray said.</P>

<P>"Almost everything's affected (((a subhead with haiku-like
clarity)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The deluge == in which as much as 28 inches of rain
fell in the past 24 hours == has affected all aspects of
life in the area, from communications to transportation to
automated teller machines:
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"*All Metro bus routes have been canceled today because
of high water. No buses are running, Metro Police said.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"*More than two feet of rain fell at Bush
Intercontinental Airport, forcing Houston-based
Continental Airlines to cancel all flights through 6 a.m.
Sunday there. Airline spokesman Ned Walker said that would
involve about 1,000 flights. The biggest problem was the
availability of crews and staff who couldn't get to the
Bush Intercontinental Airport, he said. (((Drowned cars
equals no planes at "Bush" airport.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"*Authorities shut down some local freeways in order to
clear broken-down vehicles. Currently, U.S. Highway 59
(Southwest Freeway) is shut down eastbound at the
Fondren/Bellaire exit. Interstate 10 is reportedly shut
down in spots, too. I-10 at T.C. Jester is submerged and
blocked by stranded vehicles, including massive 18-
wheelers that floated like a child's bathtub toys.
(((Poetry is not dead in modern journalism.))) In some
places, water is touching the bottom of freeway
underpasses, turning the low-lying roadways into lakes.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"*The city reported its communications system was down,
but communications are going ahead through hand-held
radios. The mayor said 911 service is working, but
stressed to only use the service in the case of a true
emergency.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"*Eckels authorized workers to pump water out of an
AT&amp;T switching center in the 1400 block of Jefferson,
saying he was told if that center went down, the area
would lose all wireless and long distance communication.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"*As of midafternoon, Reliant Energy/HL&amp;P said about
34,000 of its 1.2 million Houston-area customers were
without power. Most of these were in Bellaire and the
Greenspoint and Humble areas, spokeswoman Alicia Dixon
said. She said the company's crews are having difficulty
reaching the areas where power is out, so service is being
restored slowly.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Restoring power to flooded hospitals in the Texas
Medical Center poses special problems, Dixon said. Because
power is supplied to the medical center through
underground cables, it is unsafe to restore electricity
until the water has subsided and the cables are dry.
((("The lightning missed me, but then I stepped on that
cable.")))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"*An estimated 76,000 ATMs in 22 states may be
affected by weekend flooding in the Southeast Texas, a
banking official said. Access to ATMs in the Pulse network
was disrupted when the primary and secondary power
supplies were flooded in Houston, said Julian Read, a
spokesman for Pulse, a nonprofit electronic funds transfer
network. It has more than 2,600 financial institution
members. Also, an estimated 300,000 point-of-sale
transactions == using an ATM at a cashier == may be
affected.</P>


<P>(...)
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Medical Center experienced severe flooding and
power outages. Many ambulances are unable to traverse the
high water in the area to deliver patients and there are
reports that some patients on automated life-support
machines were being kept alive by manual means. Hospital
officials are making arrangements to transfer the most
critical patients to other hospitals as far away as Austin
and San Antonio, city officials said. ((("Austin Welcomes
Manually Pumped Life Support Users' Group, Enjoy Your

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Houston Fire Department has fielded 500 water
calls and 200 fire calls since 11 p.m. Friday night, city
officials said. (...)
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Waterways overflowing
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At 7 a.m. today, catastrophic flooding was reported
along Spring Creek near Spring on the north side of
Houston with water possibly near the rooftops of some
homes in Timberlake and Timberridge subdivisions in
Montgomery County and and the Spring Hills subdivision
south of The Woodlands.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The National Weather Service reported that Clear
Creek in Friendswood southeast of Houston was rising
rapidly and was at 17.7 feet at 6:30 a.m. at FM 528. The
record flood level at that point is 19.1 feet. (...)
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Coast Guard said the upper part of the Houston
Ship Channel was closed after 26 barges and two ships
broke free from moorings at the Port of Houston, clogging
one of nation's busiest waterways. (((Waterways blow
out.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An insurance trade group late Saturday doubled its
initial estimate of losses from the storms to at least
$120 million. The figure did not count damage to hundreds
of flooded homes, which must be covered by separate
federal flood insurance. (((Yeah. Sure.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'This weather-related event continues to present
developing losses for insurers,' Jerry Johns, president of
the Southwestern Insurance Information Service, said. 'We
are far from being close to what this might cost the
insurance industry.'  (((Make the coal companies pick up
the tab.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(((Some nice human-angle stuff here.))) (...) "a woman
who called to say she was stuck in her attic at a home on
Valley Wind Drive in Houston, said Amy Askins, a Brazoria
County sheriff's dispatcher.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Another woman called a friend in Brazoria County and
asked her to tell the sheriff's department she was stuck
in a van that was floating in the high water, Askins said.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Allen Cannon, a 29-year-old engineer from Pearland,
called Brazoria County dispatchers when he couldn't reach
his wife, Shundra, who had checked into a motel at
Interstate 10 and Federal after floodwaters marooned her
in traffic. He last spoke with his wife, a 29-year-old
assistant principal at Welch Middle School, at 1 a.m.
today, he said.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'She told me the water was to the level of the
mattresses on the first floor,' he said. 'She's on the
second floor. She's pregnant but she's got a friend with
her.

her cellular phone battery was about to go dead." (...)

"Theaters, museums close</P>

<P>"Meanwhile, the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston will be
closed today and Sunday because of minor flooding in the
service area that has affected the air-conditioning and
telephone systems. No art has been damaged. (((Culture
industry blows out.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Films and family activity scheduled today and Sunday
are canceled. Also, advanced tickets purchased for the
'Star Wars' exhibit for today and Sunday will be honored
at a later date. (((Hey, you can't shut down STAR WARS!

<P>"Woman drowns when elevator floods in basement
By ROSANNA RUIZ
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An unidentified 42-year-old law firm employee drowned
when water rushed into an elevator while at the basement
level of a downtown building, police said.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The woman intended to move her car at about 5:30 a.m.
from the Bank of America's four-level underground parking
garage at 700 Louisiana, said Robert Hurst, a police
spokesman.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'The woman went down in the elevator after a broadcast
was made in the building by the security department that
water was coming into the parking garage and anyone in the
building should go down and move their cars,' Hurst said.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The woman, who was the only elevator occupant at the
time, drowned when water rushed into the elevator while on
the third level of the garage, Hurst said.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'It appears that water began rushing into the
elevator and it malfunctioned and she drowned in the
elevator,' Hurst said. 'She didn't even make it to her car
parked on the fourth level.'  (((Dead for an internal
combustion vehicle.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The woman's body was discovered about 8:30 after
maintenance crews noticed that the elevator had stalled
and they manually brought the elevator to the lobby level.
(((Imagine their surprise when the doors opened.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(...) "The woman and some of her colleagues had stayed
the night at the law office in the bank building when they
realized they could not make it home because of the
flooding, Hurst said."</P>
