<P>(((It's 1983 all over again here in the USA; open scorn
for international accords, a brand-new Cold War, and a
corrupt Evil Empire run by aging ideologues with heart
problems.  Europe's got the 21st century all to itself!)))</P>

<P>(((I find a definite upside here -- I'm feeling 18 years
younger!  We '80s cyberpunks always hankered to be heroic
dissidents in a corporate-dominated dystopia.  Cue those
syndrums, maestro, it's war to the knife in the neon-lit
backstreets of cyberspace!)))</P>

<h3>"Climate Change: Bush imposes the death penalty on the World"</h3>

<P>"Speaking during today's debate in the European Parliament
on the USA's refusal to sign up to the Kyoto protocol,
Alexander de Roo MEP (Greens/Netherlands), Vice-President
of the Environment Committee, said:</P>

<P>"'After President Bush's irresponsible decision to
abandon the Kyoto Protocol on climate change, the EU and
other parties involved are left with no choice other than
to go it alone and sign up to the protocol.
</P>

<P>"'The failure of the EU's delegation to the US 
yesterday should have taught us a lesson: friendly words
and pleas will not change the mind of this stubborn
administration. We reiterate our call on EU citizens as
well as the rest of the World, to boycott products of
American oil companies, namely Exxon, Texaco and Chevron.
Bush claims that American economic interests come before
all else. But the World must show the US that ignoring
climate change will cost dearly and hurt these economic
interests.   (((You go Euro!  Chase 'em right off your
continent!  Ecrasez l'infame! Toujour l'audace!  You're
Dutch, go indict 'em in The Hague, let's <STRONG>get with it</STRONG>
here....)))
</P>

<P>"'The European Parliament should not be afraid to speak out clearly in favour of a boycott. There is a
precedence where European national parliaments voted to
boycott other countries, such as the Dutch and the Swedish
parliament's boycott of the old apartheid regime in South
Africa.  (((It's the global US Disinvestiture movement!
Gotta admire the intellectual consistency here!)))</P>

<P>"While the death penalty in the United States is utterly unethical, it is the country 's own internal
decision. But the attitude of the USA towards climate
change is an international matter. Bush's boycott of the
Kyoto Protocol imposes the death penalty on the entire
world and that is entirely unacceptable."  (((Hey
Europeans, if you leave us, can we come too?  There must
be a great market niche here for American dissidents who
would love to do all their buying in Europe for the next
four years.  Well, everything but beef, that is.)))</P>

<h3>"U.S. Climate Stance Triggers Boycott Threats</h3>

<P>"LONDON, United Kingdom, April 5, 2001 (ENS) == The USA's
decision to abandon the Kyoto climate protocol is sparking
a wave of calls from European environmentalists and Greens
for consumers to take revenge on President George W. Bush
by boycotting American firms.</P>

<P>"It remains unclear whether any will get off the ground,
though companies are watching the development anxiously.
(((Even while their stock valuations soar!)))</P>

<P>"Leading the charge in favor of economic punishment to be meted out to the United States are Europe's Greens, who
sparked a vote in the European Parliament on the issue
today.</P>

<P>"Green Party lawmakers asked fellow Members of the European Parliament to back a resolution calling on
European consumers to boycott Exxon, Texaco and Chevron.
(((A refreshing change from Greens beating up on BP and
Shell, who are, after all, European.))) These three U.S.
based oil firms are suspected of having influenced
America's policy shift on the Kyoto Protocol from support
under former President Bill Clinton to withdrawal under
Bush. ((("Suspected of"?  Come on, fellas.  This doesn't
require much in-depth investigation; I think we can
establish this without paging Carla del Ponti.)))</P>

<P>"The resolution was defeated by a margin of over three to one. (((Yeah, but it's a start!)))</P>

<P>"Meanwhile, boycott campaigns have been launched by some European environmental groups, such as the UK based
Families Against Bush which demonstrated today outside the
U.S. Embassy in London.</P>

<P>"Families Against Bush advocates a selective boycott of American products and services until the President
supports the Kyoto Protocol and agrees to reduce U.S.
greenhouse gas emissions. (((Well, where are you, "FAB"?
Can't find your website.  Truck out those "products and
services," let's see if they have any connection to fiscal
reality.)))</P>

<P>"'Consumers can use the only real influence available to
them and hit that part of corporate America which put Bush
in power and which thinks it can get away with polluting
while the rest of the world pays the price,' the group
said.  ((((Intelligently.)))  It does not support a
boycott of companies opposing the Bush line on the climate
agreement. (((Well then!)))</P>

<P>"'A boycott of sugar from American plantations helped stop the slave trade,' a spokesman said.  (((Uh fellas, I
kinda take your point there, but us Americans had to
butcher each other wholesale for four years over that.)))
"'This time the quality and existence of billions of lives
are ultimately under threat unless effective action is
taken.'  (((Well, uh, yes.)))</P>

<P>"Europe's larger environmental groups are also examining the options for applying pressure on the U.S.
government to work with other industrialized nations
within the framework of the Kyoto Protocol, an addition to
the United Nations Climate Change Convention. (((Look,
forget about it, that Protocol wouldn't work anyway, but
hey,  bankrupting those clowns who just bought the
President and the Senate, that would sure be a healthy
first step.  We won't even bring up the issue of Elf-
Aquitaine and how it put your political parties into its
pocket for decades on end.)))</P>

<P>"Greenpeace today called on America's largest 100 firms to declare opposition to the Bush administration's
position or 'face the consequences from concerned
consumers, institutions and organisation from around the
world.' (((That musta been mighty scary, considering that
Greenpeace's number one enemies for years have been, uh,
Shell and BP.)))</P>

<P>"'We've been deluged with requests for campaign action or a boycott,' said Greenpeace climate campaigner
Stephen Sawyer. (((Steve was on the Rainbow Warrior, and
you saw what they did to the French.)))</P>

<BR></P>

<P>'We want to give people a chance to make their views clear. There's a lot of anger out there, a desire to
retaliate against Bush.'  (((Okay, but why that Bush in
particular?  Plenty Bushes left in the clan corral.  As
long as they're making money pumping smut, they'll just
buy themselves another one.)))</P>

<P>(...)</P>

<P>"'The American people can register their opinions at the ballot box. (((Unless they're in Florida.)))  But for
the rest of the world -- shocked at the worst greenhouse
polluter's rejection of its responsibility for the global
environment -- all we can do is register our opinions via
the marketplace,' said Dr. Gerd Leipold, Greenpeace
International executive director. (((Look: if you don't
get them in the marketplace, you haven't gotten them at
all.)))</P>
