<P>oooooooooooooooooooo
Meet Paul Di Filippo
oooooooooooooooooooo</P>

<P>If you've never heard of cyberpunk science fiction writer
and critic Paul Di Filippo, then never mind this part. But
Paul, who is a very lion of modern speculative literature,
is staying in my house this weekend for an Austin writers
workshop, where we are soberly discussing science fiction
and sundry related issues.  Though Paul is on Viridian
List, this is a  literary event.  After the workshop,
we're throwing a house party, starring my good friend and
yours,  Paul.  If you'd like to show up at my house and
talk to him, send me some email.</P>

<P>(((The political and economic aspects of the California
Energy crisis got a large bandaid recently, when the
California Legislature agreed to spend several billion
dollars to buy transmission lines from utilities.  This
quasi-bailout should get the near-bankrupt utilities more
or less off the hook.  However, the state's been hovering
at the edge of blackouts for a month now, and supplies
this summer are looking quite scary.</P>

<P>(((In the meantime, California's Fetzer wine company just
can't help gloating a little.  Fetzer and their green
products received intense Viridian attention in  Notes
00104 and 00109, when we were trying hard to find a clean,
green, solar-powered vintage that we could actually
swallow.)))</P>

<P>"Conservation, Green and Solar Energy Mean Energy Cost
Stability for Fetzer Vineyards</P>

<P>"HOPLAND, Calif.== (BUSINESS WIRE)== Feb. 13, 2001 via
NewsEdge Corporation</P>

<P>"As many of California's businesses scramble to discover
ways to lessen the impact of an out-of-control energy
market and skyrocketing energy costs, those with
alternative energy programs and comprehensive energy
conservation programs in place stand at a great advantage.</P>


<P>"In the wine industry, Fetzer Vineyards, a winery leading
the charge for sustainable business practices for the past
decade, uses a combination of ambitious energy reduction
programs, photo-voltaic solar panels, and 100% Green
(renewable) energy purchasing to produce over three
million cases of wine each year.</P>

<P>"'Our contract for 100% renewable energy continues as
usual with Enron Energy Services, so our costs are stable
for the green energy we are purchasing,' explains Patrick
Healy, environmental manager at Fetzer. 'We have more
conservation programs coming on-line in 2001 that will
result in dramatic usage reductions this year in spite of
plans to increase production.'</P>

<P>"Fetzer also reaps the energy benefit of 90 photo-voltaic
panels on the company's rammed earth Administration
Building, which have generated 56,000 kilowatt hours of
electricity in the past year, running at 98% efficiency.
The electricity generated by the panels fully powered the
Administration Building in 2000. (...)</P>

<P>"Located in California's Mendocino County, Fetzer
Vineyards was founded in 1968 by the Fetzer family and is
now part of the Brown-Forman Wine Group. Throughout the
last decade, Fetzer has played a leading role in organic
vineyard farming practices, as well as being a leader and
pioneer in solid waste reduction and innovative recycling
programs. Noted for producing some of America's most
popular and award-winning wines, Fetzer has also received
numerous awards for its environmentally responsible
business practices. To learn more about Fetzer Vineyards,
