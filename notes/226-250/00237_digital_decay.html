<P>"Preserving the Immaterial" Conference
Guggenheim Museum, New York City
March 30, 02001</P>

<P>
"Digital Decay"
</P>

<P>You may wonder why a science fiction writer like
myself takes such obvious delight in hanging out with
museum curators.  It's a paradox, like the one we heard in
the name of this conference, "Preserving the Immaterial."
If it's immaterial, why would it need preserving?  And if
you're a futurist, then how come you're in a museum?
</P>

<P>But there's no contradiction here; it makes perfect
sense if you look at right.  Futurists and antiquarians
both work with the nature of time.  I have a passionate
allegiance to my esteemed colleagues in museums.   Because
the future is just a kind of past that hasn't happened
yet.  And obsolescence is innovation in reverse.
</P>

<P>Curators, conservators and archivists are much closer
to the future than most of us mortals.  That's because
they store, catalog and preserve == they physically touch
== the objects of the past and present that people in the
future will see.
</P>

<P>When you hang out with conservators and archivists,
then you get to see what the passage of time really does.
These folks have a job of work.  The processes of decay
may be a little hard to spot during a single human
lifetime, but in a museum, you can find out that  Entropy
commands a mighty legion of ruin.
</P>

<P>We've got  all the usual awe-inspiring, mythical
threats:  fire, flood, storm, earthquake, frenzied mobs,
carpet-bombings, plagues, and swarms of locusts.  Egyptian
rains of frogs.  Asteroid impacts.
</P>

<P>But those are the easy ones; nothing going on there
that a little reinforced concrete and a swarm of well-
armed guards can't control.  The stuff that really gets to
objects, the stuff that takes the worst toll even of
cherished museum pieces == these are the very same
qualities  that make human life so delightful.   Not the
rare catastrophes, but the everyday things, the completely
persistent things.
</P>

<P>Things like sunlight.  Sunlight is a blessed,
glorious thing.   Sunlight is also a powerful blast of
radiation from a vast nuclear inferno that happens to be
in our sky.  I have solar panels on my roof; when the sun
is high, I can run  my whole house from the power in
sunlight.  Light may be considered all angelic, clear, and
immaterial, so  light is supposedly the very opposite of
dense heavy matter, but light and matter are aspects of
the same thing;  Einstein proved that.   You can try it at
home:   put a newspaper in the sun.  In a few days, a few
weeks, a few months,  all that inky, analog data in that
newspaper gets blasted with these hot little packets of
solar energy, and the paper  curls up, and turns brown,
and it flakes, and finally, it breaks up, and breaks down.
</P>

<P>Then there's water.  Water's everywhere, it's in here
with us right now, as moisture in the air.   Water is the
very stuff of life == and also the stuff of decay.
Humidity itself is rather dangerous to objects,  but
everyday <STRONG>changes</STRONG> in humidity are ruinous.  If humidity
changes, then materials swell up and shrink repeatedly,
until  paint falls off its canvas,  ink flakes off its
parchment,  wooden handles fall off metal tools.
</P>

<P>Microbes love water as much as we humans do.  So
anything that is moist, and remotely organic, will be
slowly eaten by airborne legions of mold, bacteria, and
fungi.
</P>

<P>Without any water, though, stuff mummifies horribly;
then we get stiffness, brittleness, permanent shrinking,
splitting, cracking, and flaking.
</P>

<P>Consider other major benefits to life, such as food.
A terrible thing in museums, food.  Airborne greasy
droplets off stoves, moldy scraps and crumbs, spilled Coca
Cola.  This is hearty nutrition for every variety of
destructive vermin: silverfish, mice, carpet beetles.
Those daring little creatures are the Earth's card-
carrying agents of organic recycling.   They must be
fought constantly.
</P>

<P>Tell me you're not smoking around a museum piece.
Smoke puts a yellow lacquer on your teeth, on your lungs,
and on everything in the vicinity.  And even if you stop
smoking, that doesn't mean that cars stop, or that
factories stop;  people in cities live in a sea of smoky
pollution that strips stone statues; it corrodes solid
bronze.
</P>

<P>Humanity itself is gloriously physical.  That means
grease from our fingerprints, damp from our exhalations,
sneezing, coughing, skin flakes, bacteria,  steamy body
heat from big eager crowds of us, all queuing up to admire
that timeless masterpiece.  Because if nobody sees a
museum piece, what's the point of having it or keeping it?
Museums exist for a social purpose, for us humans.  Trees
and clouds don't need museums.
</P>

<P>The final painful paradox lies in harming what we
save, as we try to save it.  Preservation is itself a
source of hazard.   We dropped the precious china while we
were dusting it.  We tripped, and split the old painting
frame.  We tried to fix that old book with tape and rubber
cement.
</P>

<P>Entropy requires no maintenance.  Entropy has its
own poetry:  it's all about delamination, disintegration,
deterioriation, degeneration, decomposition, and doddering
decline.
</P>

<P>But thanks to fantastic breakthroughs in modern
technology,  we've got a cure for all that:
<STRONG>digitalization!</STRONG>  Flawless computer memories!  Lightning-
fast chips!  Fat fiber-optics!  Massive storage
facilities!   Bits not atoms!  It's immaterial, so it
needs no preserving; it's escaped from the python coils of
history; time harms it no more;  it's up there at the
pearly gates, spotless and radiant, right next to Saint
Peter.
</P>

<P>You're probably guessing by now that I'm about to
wax all cynical about this deeply flawed concept, and yes,
indeed I am.  But before I do that,  I should give the
digital its proper due.
</P>

<P>I happen to be quite the devotee of digital
technology; use it all the time.  Wrote this speech with
it, even.   Before you heard these words, they were in my
computer as digital data.   They're still sitting there,
probably, unless my house has burned down.   What have we
got in that computer down there in Texas? We've got a long
string of ones and zeros.
</P>

<P>This situation has great virtues.   First of all,
ones and zeros are extremely clear.  No blurriness, no
ambiguity, no proofreading problems.  There's just two
possible symbols here, a charge or no charge, a pit or a
bump, some light or some darkness, they're very crisp and
distinct.
</P>

<P>Next, it's universal, because binary notation
conquered the computer world.  We don't have rival
computer systems that use ones, zeros, and twos, and also
some threes.  It's ones and zeros for one and all, here
there and everywhere.
</P>

<P>Then there's error checking.  A tremendous boon. You
add up all those ones and zeros.  Is it the right number?
Then you must have an accurate copy.  Bookkeeping doesn't
add up?  Your copy is bogus!
</P>

<P>Then there's shipping via Internet.  What a joy!
Stream of photons, stream of electrons, all ones and
zeros.  Arrives like lightning anywhere on the planet.
</P>

<P>And better yet, copies are practically free.   Want
ten of 'em, you just write down ten Internet addresses!
Whip 'em on out there, new copies appear all over the
planet.  Copies come so easily, so cheaply, that it hardly
seems like work; no one has to feel responsible;
everybody always cheerfully assumes that <STRONG>somebody else</STRONG>
kept a copy.
</P>

<P>And finally there's storage.  Storage too cheap to
meter.   We're putting vast libraries on a magnetic strips
or optical disks, there's plenty of room on the bottom, we
just cram in that info, we're packing the phone booth with
the entire University here, let's just keep on shrinking,
it's the way forward.
</P>

<P>That is a marvelous set of virtues.   No wonder
people were impressed.  Most of these virtues are
attributable to the fact that, by historical standards,
digital media have very little materiality.
</P>

<P>However.  Very little materiality, is very, very far
from no materiality at all.  Total immateriality is a
metaphysical illusion, it has nothing to do with physics
or engineering.   It's exhilirating to watch these heaps
of data vanishing into microscopic scales, and if it's
doubling every eighteen months == hey, everything in
computerland wants to double every eighteen months == then</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>it looks like it's going to totally vaporize, just any<BR>
second now.   But it never does.  Never.   Even vapor is a<BR>
material.   Mass and energy are conserved in an</P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<P>Einsteinian universe, so things just don't
"immaterialize."   Forget about it.
</P>

<P>Software is very protean, so you can call it a lot
of things:  you can call it art, science, free expression,
mathematics, a medium, data, information, code, artificial
intelligence, cyberspace; frozen thought; you can call it
the noosphere and the Holy Ghost.  But if you don't
preserve it in some material form, you are not preserving
immateriality: you are preserving nothing.
</P>

<P>Now let's  compare, let's say, a top of the line
Apple iMac with some Van Gogh sunflowers.  A 19th century
oil painting versus a 21st century computer.  Side by
side, on their dual, heroic journey, into the distant
future.  Against all the hazards of the world.  What are
they up against, how are they doing?  First, let's check
those Biblical catastrophes: fire, flood, asteroids,
check, check, check, they're both totally obliterated.
</P>

<P>Let's get down to the everyday stuff.  Number one
threat, sunlight.  Bad for oils, quite bad for plastics
too.  Ten years of hot sunlight on that glossy iMac
console, and our candy-colored iMac is a lot less yummy.
</P>

<P>Next, water.  Glass of water onto the oil painting.
Oh my.  Glass of water into the computer?  A catastrophe!
</P>

<P>How about microbes?  Not much to eat in a computer,
but it sure attracts dust;  that's because it's
electrically charged.   Just run your finger across that
user-friendly screen: it comes up black.  If you dare,
look inside at the thick fur coats of dust growing on all
those highly-charged chips and capacitors.  That's pollen
for microbes to eat.  It's also specks  of corrosive smog.
</P>

<P>It's warm inside computers; bugs like warmth.   Can
you eat around a computer?  You really shouldn't.  Smoke
around it?  No way.  Touch it with your big greasy hands?
Maybe you shouldn't, but you've got to; it won't run
otherwise.  You're pounding that keyboard, you're rolling
that mouse.  A machine has  moving parts, so it's taking
physical wear every time it performs.  It's not much use
if it's cold and dead inside a vitrine.
</P>

<P>So a computer's got the conservation problems that a
painting has,  plus a bunch of new ones.   Computers  run
on electricity: they get power surges, floods of bad
voltage that just crack components and blow them up.   The
screens are also vulnerable:  cathode-ray tubes have big
electronic guns firing beams at a powder.
</P>

<P>Heat cycling cracks chips, stressing them
mechanically every time you boot up or shut down.  Maybe
you don't dare to turn the computer off,  in which case it
simply sits there, sucking energy, tethered to the wall by
a dangerous leash, costing you money.
</P>

<P>Computers have dozens of  components; if one
malfunctions,  it takes the whole machine down.  If you
try replacing a specific computer component, you soon find
that the computers themselves were assembled by computers.
They're made of a gaggle of components from factories all
over the planet,  picked up on the cheap in fast, fluid,
friction-free, digital markets.   These are super-
sophisticated buying and assembling processes that are
never quite the same day by day.  That's why Dell and
Gateway can make a computer just for you.  But if it's
made just for you, how can somebody else truly duplicate
it?  The answer is that you <STRONG>don't</STRONG> duplicate computers.
You don't restore them to some past, pristine condition.
That's unheard of.  You just buy a brand-new one.  A
bigger one, a faster one.  A different one.
</P>

<P>Maybe it seems like I'm ducking the issue here,
because we're not really trying to preserve mere
computers, are we?  Because when you really and seriously
contemplate preserving a computer:  for fifty years,
seventy-five years, a hundred and fifty years == oh well
that's <STRONG>obviously</STRONG> hopeless!  Of course the thing would
burn out from its constant torrent of voltage.  Of course
its plastic mechanical parts would jam and crack.  Of
course the screen blows up, the mouse wears down and you
can't get replacement  parts.  The processor is the heart
of a computer, but a chip fabricator is a vast enterprise
with super-clean rooms, costing billions of dollars.  You
can't re-tool these huge factories to recreate obsolete
processors.
</P>

<P>But we're not worried about  all that, are we?
Because who cares about the merely material computer == we
just need the immaterial software, the data.  We all know
how easy it is to save that stuff; you just pour it from
an old computer into a new one.  It's a stream of ones and
zeros, all pure and clean and invisible, kind of like
ether, or phlogiston.
</P>

<P>This is the part where we really have to scrunch up
and stare, ladies and gentlemen.  Because every time that
the computer industry confuses its hardware with
philosophy, we've got a serious problem.   A stream of
bits is not just ones and zeroes.  Ones and zeroes are
numbers, and even if arithmetic is immaterial, computers
aren't.   Bits are not different from atoms: bits are bits
of atoms.   Bits are not ghosts or spirits or good
intentions, bits have to be measurable, observable
physical objects, like a Greek vase.  Bits may be too
small for the naked eye to see, but just like a cold germ
or a hepatitis virus, they are most definitely around, and
they're a lot of trouble.  Bits are moving electrons,
moving photons, or they are  magnetized clumps of atoms,
laser burn marks in plastic, iron filings stuck together
with tape.  That's what bits are.
</P>

<P>Bits have no archival medium.  We haven't invented
one yet.  If you print something on acid-free paper with
stable ink, and you put it in a dry dark closet, you can
read it in two hundred years.  We have no way to archive
bits that we know will be readable in even fifty years.
Tape demagnetizes.  CDs delaminate.   Networks go down.
</P>

<P>There is a whole chain of additional failure points,
inherent in the nature of contemporary computers.
</P>

<P>The recording media we have right now are bound to
fail quickly: but that's just hazard one.  The computer
itself becomes obsolete: that's hazard two.   Then comes
the operating system: the OS can be replaced, or upgraded,
and made incompatible with earlier versions, or it can
simply vanish from the market.
</P>

<P>The same thing can happen to the application that
created the data.  That application can fail in several
places.   It can't run off that operating system.  It
can't run on that make of computer.  It can't even run off
that storage system; in the case of multimedia or
streaming video, maybe the bandwidth isn't fast enough;
you've preserved every one and zero in fine order, but you
can't move them fast enough or in the proper order,  so
you can't make it work.
</P>

<P>Then there's a host of other little pests: video
cards, sound cards. Different makes with a host of
incompatibilities, so they refuse to plug and play.
Different mice, different joysticks.   Different monitors.
Color systems:  this software runs only under 256 colors.
Weblinks may have been built into it; it may be making
lonely system-calls to some piece of equipment or some
data that no longer exists.
</P>

<P>Compression algorithms may have squeezed the data
into some unrecognizable shape.  It may have been
encrypted, carefully put under digital lock and key; but
the key may be gone, the whole encryptor may be gone.  The
system can't boot because its extensions are incompatible.
The software's got viruses.  It's an emulator of an
emulator's emulator.
</P>

<P>When it piece of software decays, it doesn't degrade
like a painting, slowly and nostalgically.  When software
fails it crashes; it means the Blue Screen of Death.
</P>

<P>These are dire problems.  They are massively
underappreciated.  That is why conferences like this are
important today, and even more important to the future.
</P>

<P>Let me end with a futuristic speculation.   In his
book CLOCK OF THE LONG NOW, Stewart Brand took  a long
look at the scope of this problem: systems too complicated
to understand, with incompatible standards, and dying,
obsolete hardware.  A world with giant legacy systems too
expensive to replace, too big to comprehend, being run by
giant, unwieldly financial markets, utilities, health care
systems, national and international bureaucracies.
Software written in great haste and under terrible market
pressures, digits in decay that lack any safe havens, like
museums, where data might be kept and safely restored.
And Stewart Brand sums up that future world in this way:
</P>

<P>"The system doesn't really work, it can't be fixed, no
one understands it, no one is in charge of it, it can't be
lived without, and it gets worse every year."
</P>

<P>That doesn't sound good.  Yet it sounds rather
plausible.  Why?  Because that is a universal human
experience.    Anybody pushing seventy knows that
situation; that is the authentic voice of human mortality
there:  "I don't work any more, they can't fix me, nobody
understands me, nobody's in charge of me, and I'm getting
worse every year."
</P>

<P>The reason history never ends at this point is that
new people come along.  New people with a fresh
perspective, and a new set of understandings, and a bunch
of problems they inherited.  They can see the legacy of
history in a different context.  The future has become
their past.
</P>

<P>That's the kind of activity that I hope you'll be
seeing at this event.  It's a big job, but it's no
surprise that the digital art world should declare itself
an avant-garde in this matter.   There are very bright
people here and  I wish them the best of luck.     That's
all I have to say tonight; thanks for your attention.</P>
