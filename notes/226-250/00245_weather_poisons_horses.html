<P>Allen Varney remarks:  "A Wexelblat disaster has hit
Kentucky horse-breeders. Weird weather promotes unusually
high cyanide concentrations in black cherry leaves.
Caterpillars eat the leaves. Horses eat caterpillar feces
(yuck!) and miscarry. God only knows what the horseflesh
industry does with aborted horse fetuses; let's hope they
don't grind them up for livestock feed."</P>

<P>"Caterpillar Blamed for Kentucky Horse Deaths</P>

<P>"LEXINGTON, Ky. (Reuters) == The illness that caused
hundreds of Kentucky mares to miscarry or deliver
stillborn foals has been traced to caterpillars which had
eaten cherry tree leaves tainted with naturally occurring
cyanide, officials said on Friday.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Unusually high levels of the poison in populous black
cherry trees was somehow transferred to the mares ==
possibly through feces from Eastern tent caterpillars in
bluegrass pastures == and killed the unborn horses in the
womb.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Roughly one out of 20 foals due to be born this spring
died, and next year's foal crop may be cut sharply,
causing at least $225 million in lost foal sales and stud
fees in Kentucky's $1 billion annual horse industry.
(((Whoa!)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Mare reproductive loss syndrome,' the name given to
the illness that peaked earlier this month, has subsided
recently, veterinarians said.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Breeders had taken desperate measures such as
delivering foals early and keeping mares out of their
famed bluegrass pastures. Originally, scientists had
thought toxin-producing molds had attacked pastures, which
in turn had caused the reproductive problem in the mares.
(((Toxic, moldy bluegrass pastures would have been even
scarier.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But scientists told breeders on Thursday that the
cause of the foal deaths was likely the caterpillar and
the cyanide-producing trees, and that the problem was
safely past.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In future, horse breeders could take precautions when
caterpillar populations are heavy, such as restricting
grazing, University of Kentucky Agriculture Department
spokesman Haven Miller said in a telephone interview.</P>

<P>(((Here comes the story's actual lede paragraph.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'The unusual weather pattern could have caused the
cyanide levels in the trees to be higher,' Miller said.
'We had a similar problem in 1980-81,' when many
unexplained horse deaths occurred.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This spring featured similarly warm, dry weather
followed by a sudden frost, which not only damaged
pastures but may have increased the poison content in the
trees. Breeders have known about the cyanide content in
cherry trees, and some chop them down." (((So now you are
horseless and cherryless, but at least you don't have to
face up to your loss of natural weather.)))</P>
