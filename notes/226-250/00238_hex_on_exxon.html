<P>"Exxon Mobil Tops 2001 Ranking of the Fortune 500;
Oil giant replaces GM at top of list after 15 years;
Mega-Retailer Wal-Mart is No.2</P>

<P><BR>
"NEW YORK == (BUSINESS WIRE) == April 1, 2001 via NewsEdge
Corporation</P>

<P>"Exxon Mobil vaulted into the top spot on the annual
FORTUNE 500 ranking of the largest American companies,
replacing 15-year veteran GM.</P>

<P>"With revenues for 2000 at a record $210 billion, 
      Exxon outpaced No. 2 Wal-Mart by $17 billion and No. 3 GM by $26 billion. 
      The FORTUNE 500 ranking has been dominated by two industries == cars and 
      oil == since its inception in 1955: in 47 years, only two companies have 
      been at the top of the list, Exxon (which merged with Mobil in 1999) and 
      GM. (...)</P>

<P>"Exxon Mobil wasn't the only oil company to jump 
      in the rankings. (((They're just the fattest and stupidest.)))</P>

<P>"'The country faced an energy crunch as the drain 
      on resources from several years of economic expansion collided with 
      utility deregulation, soaring natural gas prices, and OPEC's maneuvering 
      to keep oil prices high,' FORTUNE's Lee Clifford writes in the 
      introduction to the list. Those high prices helped other energy companies 
      strike it rich: Duke Energy (No. 17) and Reliant Energy (No. 55) nearly 
      doubled their revenues to catapult up the list, as did diversified energy 
      companies like Enron (No. 7) and Dynegy (No. 54). (((Hear that, 
      California?)))</P>

<P>'Of course, should energy prices fall, these 
      companies will have a tough time hanging onto their new spots on the 
      FORTUNE 500,' Clifford says. (((I'm looking forward to that day when they 
      have a "tough time hanging.")))</P>

<P>(((High energy prices are quite good news for us anti-
carbon enthusiasts, except for the fact that Exxon-Mobil
are (a) corrupt denial freaks and (b) getting richer.)))</P>


<P>"On the flip side of the surge for energy 
      companies, high oil prices increased the cost of doing business for most 
      companies, and had a big impact on corporate profits last year. ((("Hey 
      business community! Watch Exxon vault past you as they gouge you straight 
      into the next recession.")))</P>


<P>"Five out of the top 15 companies made less money 
      than they did in 1999. (((So much for the Bill Market, and those golden 
      days of prosperity in the SUV rearview mirror.))) Profits rose overall by 
      8.4%, down significantly from last year's 28.7% growth.&nbsp;</P>


<P>"Together, the FORTUNE 500 generated $7.2 trillion 
      in sales (up more than 13% from last year), made $444 billion in profits, 
      and employed 24 million people. No. 1 Exxon Mobil was the most profitable 
      company, with profits rising 124% to $17.7 billion." (...)</P>

<P>(((You gotta hand it to the "faith-based protestors"
over at Campaign Exxon-Mobil == they know how to pick
on people their own size.)))</P>

<P>"Financial Risk of Global Warming:  Are ExxonMobil
Shareholders Exposed?"
<A HREF="http://www.campaignexxonmobil.org/shareholder/FinancialRisksExecSumm.shtml">http://www.campaignexxonmobil.org/shareholder/FinancialRisksExecSumm.shtml</A></P>

<P>"Want to do something about corporate encroachment on
democracy, and the unfair or abusive treatment of
employees, communities and the environment (often while
they promote themselves as generous, caring,
environmentally-friendly and good corporate citizens)?</P>

<P>"Want to get together with and learn from experts and
other activists successful in changing corporate behavior?</P>

<P>"From May 27 through May 30, 2001, activists and
organizations from all over will come together in Dallas,
Texas, to do just that at the 'Empowering Democracy:
Challenging Corporate Power and Demanding Accountability'
Conference and Day of Action.  (((Dang, man...  I bet they
can say that whole thing in one breath!  Through a
megaphone.)))</P>

<P>"As corporate influence over the political process
increases, it's becoming harder to achieve traditional
solutions for mending environmental, social and other
problems through legislative action. Campaigns to restrict
the growing power of corporations or to reform or make
them accountable to the public for their actions, called
'corporate accountability campaigns,' or simply 'corporate
campaigns', are proving successful. Under pressure from
such campaigns, Home Depot stopped carrying rainforest
lumber, Ford and General Motors withdrew from the Global
Climate Coalition,  (((yay!))) companies divested from
South Africa, and Nike and others are making strides
towards eliminating the use of sweatshops.  (((They're
making strides <STRONG>in their Nikes,</STRONG> but hey, those are
strides.)))</P>

<P>"Whether you are fighting a local corporate bully or a
giant transnational corporation,  ((((gimme the T-shirt)))
you can learn effective skills, tactics and strategies
needed to convince or require corporations to include
social, environmental and labor concerns as part of their
'bottom line.'  (((At the very least you can make their
existence a living hell, which is just what ExxonMobil is
industriously doing to the rest of us, now that I think of
it.)))  We can be much more effective and powerful if we
join together in planning campaigns. You can do all that
at our conference."</P>
