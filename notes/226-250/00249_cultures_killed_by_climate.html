<P>(((This thesis may seem a little daring, but as the years
tick on and our climate worsens, our civilization will re-
interpret <STRONG>everything</STRONG> in the past as harbingers of
climate change.  This is the "Whig version of history," a
hugely powerful psychological impulse, in which most every
past event is interpreted as leading directly to the crown
of creation, us.  So if we moderns are wandering around in
a helpless daze getting clobbered by our climate, then
<STRONG>everybody</STRONG> must have been in some kind of daze getting
clobbered by some climate.)))</P>

SCIENCE
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"WASHINGTON, April 26 ==  Timing couldn't have been
worse for the group of colonists who came ashore on
Roanoke Island in 1587, attempting to establish the first
permanent English settlement in the New World. Along with
the usual hardships of starting a new society on the edge
of the wilderness, the colonists were confronted with the
region's worst drought in 700 years, which caused mass
starvation and aggravated tense relations with Native
Americans. By 1590, the ill-fated settlers had vanished
with little trace. Roanoke's collapse in the face of harsh
climate puts it in distinguished company, a researcher
reports in the journal Science.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"RECENT CONCERNS about global climate change,
especially the impact of human activity on these changes,
have sent scientists scrambling to discover how current
climate trends fit into the larger picture of climate
change throughout Earth's history. With a growing pile of
paleoclimate data at their disposal, researchers are also
taking a closer look at how complex societies responded to
past climate change.  (((Hint: they abandoned their cities
and starved to death.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Understanding how these cultures adapted to events
like persistent droughts could provide valuable
perspective on how modern societies might respond to
future climate change, says Peter deMenocal, a researcher
at the Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory of Columbia
University.</P>

<P>"THE LONG VIEW
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Modern climate data, recorded by instrument, allow us
to study climate phenomena that vary on a time scale of
several years, such as El Nino, deMenocal notes in
Friday's issue of Science. But that record is far too
short to capture large-scale events like the drought that
wiped out Roanoke == events that we can confirm through
other detailed climate records like tree rings or lake
sediments.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These climate proxies, among others, indicate that
the past 12,000 years of Earth's climate have been a bumpy
ride, punctuated by widespread cooling events and droughts
that persisted for decades and often centuries. These
events are associated with changes in ocean circulation,
solar radiation and volcanism. Many of them occur on
thousand-year cycles, indicating that solar variability
and interactions between the ocean and atmosphere are
especially important factors influencing these climate
changes.   (((News flash: Classic Mayans, deceased 909 AD,
lacked oil derricks and coal mines.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A growing store of detailed and well-dated
paleoclimate records has contributed to 'a transformation
in the field that allows scientists to evaluate cultural
records within the context of climate,' deMenocal says.
Researchers are using this new perspective to examine how
past societies managed to cope == or failed to cope ==
with prolonged and severe climate events, events without
equal in modern times.</P>

<P>"COLLAPSE AND ABANDONMENT  (((Send for the T-shirt!)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This new outlook suggests, for instance, that the
Akkadian Empire in Mesopotamia may have been one of the
earliest complex societies felled by severe drought. The
Akkadian Empire was established around 2300 B.C., linking
rain-fed agricultural fields in northern Mesopotamia with
irrigation agriculture in the south. The empire stretched
from the present-day Persian Gulf into Turkey before it
abruptly collapsed less than 200 years later.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"By 2170 B.C., archaeological records document a mass
exodus from the north, with settlements abandoned and
refugees pouring into southern Mesopotamia. Excavations at
one of these settlements, Tell Leilan, show that the
collapse is marked by a thick layer of windblown dust
without any artifacts.  (((Brrr.)))  Three hundred years
later, smaller and more nomadic groups finally ventured
north again. (((The comforts of historical awareness! Why,
a "Greenhouse Effect" is probably nothing that a massive
population collapse and a 300 year Dark Age couldn't
cure.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Researchers found the same telltale signature of
drought in a deep-sea sediment core drilled from the Gulf
of Oman. The core documents a dramatic 300-year period of
windblown dust that could be dated to roughly the same
period as the Akkadian collapse. Chemical traces in the
dust allowed the scientists to pinpoint its origins in
Mesopotamia.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The severe climate change that may have helped
topple the Akkadians probably had its roots in the far-off
North Atlantic Ocean. Atlantic deep-sea cores suggest that
the start of the Mesopotamian drought coincides with
widespread cooling in the northern part of the ocean,
which could have affected rainfall that typically fed
Mesopotamia's rivers. Modern records show that water
supply for Mesopotamia can be cut in half when North
Atlantic sea surface temperatures are unusually cool,
deMenocal notes.  (((I hope you're listening, Saddam
Hussein.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Several thousand years later, on the other side of
the world, the Tiwanaku culture in South America faced a
similar climate challenge.  (((Tiwanaku Who?  Never heard
of 'em!  But they'll be famous soon.)))  Between 300 B.C.
and A.D. 1100, the Tiwanaku built an urban complex that
probably supported nearly half a million people. They
sustained this dense settlement through raised field
agriculture, a technique that improved drainage and
recycled nutrients in the poor tropical soil.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The raised fields of the Tiwanaku may be a good
example of a complex society already responding to the
challenges of a marginal environment, and therefore
vulnerable to sudden climate change, says deMenocal.
Around the year 1100, the cities and fields were abruptly
abandoned.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Once again, the paleoclimate record may contain
clues to the Tiwanaku collapse.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Quelccaya ice core, drilled just 125 miles from
Lake Titicaca, contains an annual record of precipitation
for the region. This ice core record shows close overlap
between the time of the Tiwanaku abandonment and the start
of an increasingly dry spell. Sediment cores from Lake
Titicaca itself also chronicle the event, showing a 33-
foot drop in the lake level at the time. The drought
persisted for several centuries, during which the Tiwanaku
went into a slow decline. ((("So, Condor Feather!  What
would you suggest we do about this severe climate problem
of ours?"  "I'd counsel slow cultural decline!")))</P>

<P>"'WE HAVE TO RELEARN HISTORY'
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The fate of the Akkadians and the Tiwanaku begs the
question: If a centuries-long drought descended today, how
would we respond?  ((("Yow!  Pump More Oil!")))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One of the most destructive droughts in recent
memory is the 1930s American Dust Bowl, which lasted only
six years. In this short time, it managed to become 'one
of the most devastating and well-documented agricultural,
economic and social disasters in the history of the United
States,' according to deMenocal.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Researchers need to gather more data on past
climates before this information can be used to accurately
predict and design strategies for future large and
persistent climate changes, says deMenocal, but
acknowledging the historic impact of these severe events
is an important step toward that goal.
<BR></P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Right now, we address climate change on the basis of
a painfully short climate record, just the past 150 years
or so that instruments have recorded,' deMenocal says. 'We
now have to relearn history on a long-term scale.'</P>

Viking colony in Greenland, Mayans in Yucatan, Anasazi
cliffdwellers in Arizona, Moche in Peru.  There must be
others; just keep digging.)))</P>
