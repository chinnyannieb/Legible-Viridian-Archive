      <p>(((After the sinister political antics of the "Greening Earth Society," 
        it's pleasant to contemplate people in business who care about global 
        warming and try to do something practical.))) </p>

      <p>"Green Mountain Energy(SM) Signs First Large Commercial Customer for 
        100% Renewable Energy </p>
      <p>"Birkenstock Footprint Sandals, Inc. Chooses Wind for the Future 2.0(SM) 
      </p>
      <p>"SOUTH BURLINGTON, Vt., July 19, 1999 </p>
      <p>"Green Mountain Energy(SM) has signed Birkenstock Footprint Sandals, 
        Inc. as its first Wind for the Future 2.0(SM) large commercial customer. 
        Green Mountain Energy(SM) will serve Birkenstock's U.S. corporate headquarters 
        and distribution center located in Marin County, California, and its premier 
        retail store located in San Francisco." </p>
      <p>(((Marin County and San Francisco. Where else? Really.))) </p>
      <p>"Wind for the Future 2.0(SM) consists of 100% renewable energy -- 25% 
        of which will come from newly constructed wind turbines as they become 
        operational. Both of Green Mountain Energy(SM)'s electric blends, Wind 
        for the Future 2.0(SM) and 100% Renewable Power 2.0(SM), are dramatically 
        cleaner than typical California power." </p>
      <p>(((Plus our so-called "electric blends" feature that annoying and novel 
        (SM) registry mark!))) </p>
      <p>"The announcement was made at the Birkenstock Store located in San Francisco, 
        with Birkenstock President Margot Fraser, U.S. Secretary of Energy Bill 
        Richardson, and Green Mountain Energy's President of the Western Region, 
        Julie Blunden." </p>
      <p>(((It would have been worth attending this event just to see a federal 
        Cabinet official ditching his wingtips and trying on Birkenstocks.))) 
      </p>
      <p>"'We chose Green Mountain Energy(SM) because of its commitment to building 
        new sources of renewable energy,' says Margot Fraser, Birkenstock President. 
        'Being a leading company in the switch to renewable energy, we hope we'll 
        raise awareness that choosing environmentally sound practices is here 
        and now. It's an important message for our company, for our customers, 
        and for other businesses as well.'" </p>
      <p>(((We can expect the Greening Earth Society to swiftly launch a coal-powered 
        countermove. "As a Republican ultra-rightist free-marketeer with a paranoid 
        anti-Kyoto foreign policy, I insist that my footgear should consume as 
        much fossil fuel as possible."))) </p>
      <p>"'The new partnership between Birkenstock and Green Mountain Energy(SM) 
        is just another example of how electricity competition encouraged a choice 
        to those looking for an alternative clean and efficient energy source,' 
        U.S. Energy Secretary Richardson said. 'Today's announcement demonstrates 
        the possibilities when a successful footwear company and an electricity 
        provider find common ground in the movement to restore a balance between 
        the needs of humanity and the needs of the environment.' </p>
      <p>(((That's some golden, mellifluous rhetoric there, Mr Secretary.))) </p>
      <p>"'Birkenstock's commitment to the environment is reflected in its manufacturing 
        and corporate practices, its use of renewable resources, like cork, in 
        its shoes and now its selection of Green Mountain Energy(SM) as its energy 
        provider,' says Julie Blunden, President of the Western Region for Green 
        Mountain Energy(SM). 'We're proud to be the energy provider of choice 
        for Birkenstock.'" </p>
      <p>(((And who wouldn't be proud? And hey, Julie, thanks for name-checking 
        our cork!))) </p>
      <p>"Other organizations that have chosen Green Mountain Energy(SM) as their 
        renewable energy supplier include the twelve churches from the Episcopal 
        Diocese of California, the UC Berkeley Students' Cooperative Association, 
        the Union of Concerned Scientists located in Berkeley, California and 
        Real Goods Trading Co. of Ukiah, California." </p>
      <p>(((This news means that, somewhere out there in California, is a Birkie-wearing, 
        Episcopalian, UC Berkeley student. She shops at the local co-op, and orders 
        all her dorm stuff from Real Goods in Ukiah. And she's a science major, 
        to boot. This means she is the greenest, most energy-correct personage 
        in the whole USA. Okay, so it's self-parodic and innately hilarious -- 
        it's got to start somewhere, people.))) </p>
      <p>"Secretary Richardson recently announced a new Energy Department initiative 
        to dramatically increase the use of wind energy to five percent by the 
        year 2020." </p>
      <p>(((The Clinton Administration has a political genius for making five 
        percent changes in twenty years seem 'dramatic.'))) </p>
      <p>"Green Mountain Energy(SM) customer demand for wind power has resulted 
        in the construction of three large- scale turbines in San Gorgonio Pass 
        located in Southern California, one of the most energetic wind sites in 
        the country." </p>
      <p>(((Okay, I admit it -- as a nouveau-riche design freak, I wouldn't be 
        caught dead in Birkenstocks. My idea of a good time pedally is a $300 
        piece of high designerese lunacy like <a href="http://www.flexiblefootwear.com/">http://www.flexiblefootwear.com</a> 
        But next time I buy shoes, I'll make a point of asking, seriously and 
        with a straight face, "Are they wind-powered?"))) </p>
