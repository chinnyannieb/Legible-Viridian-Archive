Bruce,
<P>
While looking at some web coverage of Hurricane Floyd, I came across this CNN 
story, which I think needs an extra Viridian spin.
<P>

"Web site aims to ease kids' storm fears "Hurricane prompts flood of e-mail<BR>
"September 16, 1999<BR>
"From Medical Correspondent Eileen O'Connor
<P>
"(CNN) == Because children are among those most frightened by natural disasters, 
the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA) has created a Web site, 'FEMA for 
Kids.' to help them and their parents cope with the anxiety they feel when 
events like Hurricane Floyd occur.
<P>
"The site contains information about any number of natural disasters including thunderstorms, tornadoes, hurricanes, wildfires, tsunamis, winter storms and more, at <A HREF="http://www.fema.gov/kids/">www.fema.gov/kids/</A>.
<P>
"Each section fully explains the various disasters and tries to address concerns 
children might have. For example, the hurricane section includes information on 
pets and disasters, as many children worry about the family pet when bad weather 
hits.
<P>
"Hurricane prompts flood of e-mail
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "Since FEMA's Holly Harrington launched the site, it averages 200,000 hits a 
  month, but during disasters like Hurricane Dennis and now Floyd the system has 
  been overwhelmed with e-mails from young people across the country who read the 
  site.
  <P>
  "Wednesday Harrington received an e-mail from a child in Orlando who was 
  extremely frightened by the storm and her parents' reluctance to talk about it.
  <P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
"'She knew that Floyd was coming and that she was really really really scared. 
She writes, 'My parents have not spoken a word about the hurricane, I guess we 
are just going to die,'" Harrington read.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "FEMA's site tries to help children who feel helpless by answering any 
  questions they might have about a natural disaster.
  <P>
  "To help lessen children's fears, the FEMA site lists these disaster facts for 
  children:
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    "1. Disasters don't last very long.<BR>
    "2. You can get a new routine even if you can't go home for a while.<BR>
    "3. Look to your parents or other adults for help when you feel scared.<BR>
    "4. Sometimes it helps to write or draw pictures about what has happened.<BR>
    
    "5. It's okay to cry during a disaster.<BR>
    "6. You may be able to help out.
    <P>
    "Experts say when facing a natural disaster helping children find a task, 
    even at evacuation centers, will help them to feel more in control. It is the 
    little things that ease their uncertainty. (...)"
    <P>
    <BR>

</BLOCKQUOTE>
Graham Mann further comments:   While trying to imagine seven-year-olds huddling 
in a rain-soaked evacuation camp huddled over emergency Internet-linked laptops 
in order to ease their fears == their little faces illuminated by the cheery 
storybook yellow of the FEMA website == it occurred to me that this is only 
serving part of the vast new weather-disaster demographic.<BR>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Where are the corresponding sites for teenagers ("Your Guide to Pickups in 
  Civil Emergency Shelters"), the babyboomers ("5 Insurance Companies Who'll 
  Probably Pay Up After the Storm") and, most significantly for Viridians, the 
  elderly? In March of this year, Nielsen Media Research found that there are now 
  7.6 million Internet users of 50 or older in North America alone. And according 
  to to a recent Baruch College-Harris poll for Business Week, there are now more 
  Internet users over 50 than under 20. So couldn't storm-affected seniors expect 
  some on-line support too?
  <P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Actually, FEMA already has a document called "Hurricane-Action Guidelines for 
Senior Citizens" (Publication #L-212) which I'm trying to get hold of.<BR>
Copies can be ordered from FEMA Publications, P.O. Box 2012 Jessup, MD 20794
-2012 or phone 1-800-480-2520. This might be a good source of material to get 
such a site going.
<P>
The disaster-for-seniors site could include more senior emergency posters after 
the fashion of Matt Spong's recent award-winning "Summer Health Warning" poster. 
At the risk of stereotyping the aged, special concerns for seniors in severe
-weather scenarios might include:
<P>
* Staying in touch with loved ones during severe weather disruption
<P>
* Safety of pets and garden
<P>
* Difficulties adapting to disrupted routine, esp.<BR>
medical.
<P>
* Worry about cost and difficulty of storm repairs to house
<P>
* Fears of financial hardships or problems with repair companies, insurance 
firms, etc.
<P>
* Increased risk of falls in wet, unfamiliar surroundings.
<P>
The site should definitely avoid things like CNN's depressing "Hurricane Damage 
Simulation" which, given a US city and a Staffi-Simpson severity category, 
dutifully reports the bill in billions of dollars. This wouldn't reassure my 
granddad == or anybody else, for that matter.

(((bruces remarks:  thanks for that enlightening note, Graham.  I heartily 
concur with most of it, especially the healthful practice of indoctrinating the 
next generation to anticipate and dodge weather disasters through the Web.<BR>
It's a skill that's almost bound to come in handy for them in later life.
<P>
(((However, I take sharp exception to barring the "depressing" disaster 
simulation site from old people.<BR>
On the contrary, every city manager in the world should have a Weather Financial 
Calamity Simulator, exquisitely describing various plausible, horrible things 
that bad weather can do to local real estate values.   It should be up on a 
website and running in realtime around the clock.<BR>
This online caveat would be especially useful for wealthy retirees who insist on 
buying homes on barrier islands, river deltas, earthquake fault zones, on the 
picturesque slopes of active Hawaiian volcanoes, etc.

"SPOTLIGHT<BR>
"Hurricane Floyd Storms The Web
<P>
"With each passing major event-from earthquakes in Turkey to the start of the 
National Football league season-the Web is flexing its muscles as the go-to 
source and medium for immediate news, information and community activity.<BR>
The ability to deliver up-to-date, precise information for dynamic events, such 
as rapidly moving hurricanes, not only reinforces the Web's power, it 
potentially challenges existing electronic media challenges as the source for 
breaking news.
<P>
"Hurricane Floyd's had a powerful impact on Web traffic. According to data from 
Nielsen//NetRatings, top weather-related sites saw a significant rise in traffic,
 in particular on Sept. 15 as Floyd hit the U.S.  Not only did top weather sites 
see a rise in such key metrics as audience size, page views and reach, the 
stickiness factor of time per person also rose dramatically. For Weather.Com, 
which clearly became the go-to source for Web information on Hurricane Floyd, 
the time spent per person increased more than two full minutes from Sept. 14 to 
15th.
