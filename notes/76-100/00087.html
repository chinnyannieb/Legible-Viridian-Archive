Bruce,

Here's a different take on the carbon issue from the Worldwatch Institute, where 
I work. Notice that one reason the Chinese consumption of coal is coming down is 
because they've been reducing subsidies. Does reducing subsidies for things we 
don't want qualify as a Viridian tactic?
<P>
(((Yes, absolutely.  It's extremely Viridian to stop working so hard and paying 
so much to do things we don't want to do.)))

"WORLDWATCH NEWS BRIEF 99-5

"WORLD CARBON EMISSIONS FALL<BR>
"by Christopher Flavin
<P>
"For the first time since 1993, global emissions of carbon from the combustion 
of fossil fuels declined last year, falling 0.5 percent to 6.32 billion tons, 
according to new estimates by the Worldwatch Institute. (See Figure 1.)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "This decline in emissions in the face of a world economy that expanded 2.5 
  percent in 1998 suggests an accelerated 'de-linking' of economic expansion from 
  carbon emissions, undercutting arguments that reducing emissions will damage the 
  economy. During the past two years, the global economy has grown by 6.8 percent, 
  while carbon emissions held steady, leading to an impressive 6.4 percent 
  decrease in the amount of carbon emissions required to produce $1,000 of income. 
  (See Figure 2.)
  <P>
  "This turn marks the first pause in the carbon emissions escalator since 
  economic collapse cut emissions in central Europe dramatically in the early 
  1990s. But unlike that reduction, or the previous decline connected with the oil 
  crises of the 1970s, the latest downturn did not result from a major economic 
  disruption. Still, it is not yet clear how long-lasting the new trend will be.
  <P>
  "These new global emissions figures, the first available for 1998, were 
  calculated early this month by Worldwatch researcher Gerard Alleng, using energy 
  data recently supplied by BP Amoco." (...)
  <P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
(((BP Amoco is definitely the cherished Viridian darling (when it comes to large 
creepy greasy oil companies, that is).  And now for an even more striking 
assertion:)))
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "Much of the economic growth of the last two years has come in information 
  technologies and services, sectors that are not major energy users. Contrary to 
  the implication of a recent Forbes article, operating the entire global Internet 
  requires less electricity than New York City uses. Meanwhile, industries such as 
  steel making and other resource-intensive sectors are growing more slowly." (...)
  
  <P>
  (((Those of you who were following those wacky Forbes assertions earlier (See 
  Viridian Notes 00070, 00073) may find it astonishing to suddenly hear that 
  "operating the entire global Internet requires less electricity than New York 
  City."  Could such things be?   For all its sober recitation of enviro-wonk 
  facts and figures, this Worldwatch report provoked a near-frantic, foot-stamping 
  reaction from the Viridian bete noire == yes, them once again, those very 
  paragons of evil ==  the artfully self- titled "Greening Earth Society.")))

<P>
"Much to some people's surprise, world carbon dioxide emissions declined last 
year, by 0.5 percent, at least according to Worldwatch Institute, quoting 
figures from oil giant BP Amoco.  U.S. emissions rose a mere 0.4 percent, the 
same source said, while the nation's economy grew by 4 percent. Independently, 
the U.S. Department of Energy's Energy Information Agency (EIA) calculated that 
U.S. industrial sector emissions fell by 1.2 percent in 1998.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "Worldwatch's Chris Flavin said these numbers portend an accelerated 
  'delinking' of economic growth and carbon dioxide emissions. Flavin also said 
  slower growth will make it easier to meet the Kyoto Protocol. He forgot to 
  mention U.S. emissions grew at unexpectedly high rates in 1990 == 1996.
  <P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
"Worldwatch wants to credit the Internet. 'Much of the economic growth in the 
last two years has come in information technologies and services, sectors that 
are not major energy users.' We're not so sure the Internet is a major energy 
saver: Physicist Mark Mills has calculated that e-commerce will require a 
substantial increase in electricity, given the robust growth trends already in 
place."
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  (((I've never heard of "Mark Mills," but I'm sure that the physicists on 
  Viridian List will be impressed to see that the guy Mills is a "Physicist" 
  rather than a mere physicist.  And if you think that the Greening Earth 
  Society's Physicists are impressive, you ought to see their hand-picked 
  Meteorologists!)))
  <P>
  "It's not just electricity, either.  (((Well, thank goodness for that much, at 
  least.)))  With Internet commerce soaring, goods that were normally moved by 
  truck to the mall now travel by Federal Express jet to a truck to your house. 
  There's a reason it costs more to ship Pokemon in an airplane than in a truck:  
  F-U-E-L.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Worldwatch/BP found dramatically reduced emissions in China, Japan, and Russia, 
with a smaller reduction in the European Union. What did these nations have in 
common in 1998?  How about lowered growth, recession, depression, and stagnation,
 respectively?
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "And what did the United States have that none of the above experienced as 
  much? Try a drastic reduction (15 percent) in the use of heating energy, which 
  normally eats up $50 billion in fossil fuel. This was thanks to El Nino, which 
  Vice President Al Gore &amp; Co. would like to associate with global warming."  
  (((Well, though I comprehend the terms "El Nino" and "global warming," I don't 
  actually count myself as a member of the Gore Campaign.  However, I could easily 
  be pressed into the ranks through this kind of repellent spin-doctoring.)))
  <P>
  "We'll wager these things are going to turn around by 2000. El Nino has gone 
  away, Japan is clambering off the canvas, and we're overdue for a cold winter."
  <P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
(((Well, that's certainly an interesting wager.  In fact, Greening Earth Society 
and their employers at the coal- mining Western Fuels Corp are pretty much 
wagering the future of civilization on that conviction of theirs.   We <strong>
are</strong> overdue for a cold winter, folks.  <strong>Mighty</strong> overdue.
<BR>
We're even <strong>more</strong> overdue for a cool, survivable summer.<BR>
Too bad that everybody in low-growth China, recessed Japan, depressed Russia and 
the many stagnant nations of stagnant Europe  will have to pay for the outcome 
of Mr Paynter's  wager without being able to pocket Western Fuel's profits.)))

  (((So what is the real story here, do you suppose?  Is our beloved  Net 
  costing us no more than one happy  Big Apple?  Or should we shovel coal to ship 
  our Pokemons, while we patiently wait for the return of the Ice Age?<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Not only are these two Net estimates all over the map, they're not even in the 
same solar system.  We Viridians need to know how much energy the Net is 
actually consuming in the actual world as that is actually understood by actual 
physicists and actual engineers.    We would very much like some actual factual 
facts and figures on the subject, please.  Do send some along if you have them.))
