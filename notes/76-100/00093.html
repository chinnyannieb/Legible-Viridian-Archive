	Key concepts:  non-biological petroleum, chemosynthetic bacteria, deep hot 
biosphere, Thomas Gold
<P>
Attention Conservation Notice:  Geologists have somehow managed to ignore this 
heretic for thirty years, so why should we be listening to him now?  Provokes 
cognitive dissonance of the first order.  Paradigm-rupturing.

    Well, this new book of Thomas Gold's is getting a lot of play.  I just read 
    it.  All 208 pages of it. And I'll say this for it: if it's true, it's certainly 
    is revolutionary.
    <P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  Here's the pitch.  "Fossil fuels" aren't fossils.  They don't come from 
  squished dinosaurs or ancient buried vegetation.   Hydrocarbons like methane and 
  crude oil are inherent planetary substances.  They're basically the same 
  material as the "carbonaceous chondrites" seen in asteroids, or the methane and 
  ethane seen in Jupiter and its moons.  The earth is heavily loaded with various 
  primeval oils and tarry goos, which have been slowly cooked out of its crust 
  over the eons by radioactive heat from the core.
  <P>
  Here's where it gets weirder.  The substances we know as oil and natural gas 
  have been streaming up toward the planet's surface since the planet first 
  formed.  When this hydrocarbon muck is still about ten kilometers down, it gets 
  caught within pores of the stone by primeval archaic bacteria.  These bugs live 
  inside rock, they eat this primeval asteroid goo, and they turn it into the 
  stuff we call "coal" and "crude oil."  They are chemosynthetic organisms, and 
  they thrive in extremely high, oxygen-free temperatures, in vast, impossible 
  numbers.  They're probably the original form of life on Earth.
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    Primitive earthly life probably started inside the Earth, in these flowing 
    high-energy streams of goo and muck, long before the surface was colonizable.  
    Oil and gas looks like organic products to a biochemist, but that's not because 
    they are fossilized.  It's because they've been basically fermented by a 
    previously unsuspected ecosystem of archaic bacteria.  These ancient bugs 
    basically saturate the entire rocky crust of the planet.  By weight, they're 
    probably eighty percent of all living things on Earth.
    <P>
    And that's just the start of Gold's theory.  These primeval bugs give off 
    enough fizzy foul-smelling gas to break rocks and start earthquakes.  Most metal 
    deposits: gold, zinc, silver etc == are not caused by flowing water or lava, but 
    by flowing hydrocarbons filtered and transformed by bugs.
    <P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  Even though coal sometimes  has fossils in it, coal is not fossil material.  
  Basically, coal is mats of peat that got into the way of an ongoing hydrocarbon 
  flow, and have been fossilized with carbon the way a petrified tree is 
  fossilized with silicon.
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    Most planets in the solar system share Earth's origins, so if they have life,
     it is probably single- celled and  subterranean.  And they probably do have 
    life.<BR>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Whole gooey tons of life.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    We're never going to "run out of oil."  It's not possible.  Left to 
    themselves long enough, most depleted oil patches will slowly fill back up.  
    Because they're not buried deposits.  They're lakes, backed up from streams 
    originating far deeper down.   The planet would have smothered in its own CO2 
    like Venus a long time ago, except that the surface biosphere has been laboring 
    mightly to remove CO2 from the atmosphere, and save it in massive fossil 
    chalkbeds up on the surface.
    <P>
    Even if we <strong>did</strong> run out of oil, there are enough methane 
    hydrates oozing up in ocean sediments to make all known oil reserves on Earth 
    seem minor.  There's probably "oil" or "coal" under almost <strong>everything
    </strong>, any kind of non-porous rock that can catch the flow and hold it down 
    for a while.  It's just that mistaken geological assumptions have led us to 
    drill for oil in a minor variety of places.
    <P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  Who is Thomas Gold?  Well, he's not an insane crank.<BR>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
He's a physicist, and a very blue-sky thinker.  Gold was the first guy to 
theorize that pulsars were rotating neutron stars.  He theorized that the early 
Earth might have flipped its axis of rotation (which, apparently, it did).  Gold 
has been saying for quite a long time that oil and gas are basic planetary 
substances, not fossils.  But now he's put together his best arguments in book 
length, and his thesis is considerably embroidered with many sub- theories and 
bizarre implications.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Here are some reasons not to dismiss the whole scheme immediately:
  <P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<OL type=1 start=1 >
  <LI>  Plate tectonics is a weirder idea than this, and that wasn't accepted 
  until the 1960s.
  <P>
  <LI>  Geology's full of ancient dogma because geology's a very old science.  
  We thought we understood the earth long before we caught on to the truth about 
  the other planets.
  Planets and asteroids have plenty of goop that looks like coal, natural gas, 
  and oil.
  <P>
  <LI>  If oil is a fossil, then how come oil beds are so often full of helium?  
  Helium is an astrophysics thing; there aren't any plants or animals that 
  metabolize helium.
  <P>
  <LI>  It took us until the 1970s to realize that the earth has chemosynthetic 
  life forms.  But these creatures live around the tectonic rifts that girdle the 
  whole planet.
  That's the biggest habitat on earth.  These vent creatures are totally 
  dependent on weird, thermophile bacteria.<BR>
  And they're not just based on volcanic seeps either, because these biota have 
  also been discovered around underwater oil seeps.
  <P>
  <LI>  Once people started looking for subterranean bacteria, they've have been 
  able to find living bacteria as far down as they've been able to drill.
  <P>

    Extraordinary statements require extraordinary evidence.  There's a lot less 
    evidence than I'd like to see in this book. For one counter-argument, I couldn't 
    help but notice that Gold's "pores" in the stony Earth have whatever qualities 
    he needs, whenever he needs them to make his case.   Sometimes they're fast, 
    sometimes they're slow, sometimes they're chemical filters, sometimes they're 
    high-speed conduits, sometimes they're tiny, sometimes they're oceanic, 
    sometimes they're steady- state, sometimes they're catastrophic, and so on. 
    Granted, the Earth has a lot of natural variety, but that's not for our 
    rhetorical convenience.
    <P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  But if he's half-right about any of the stuff he says here, the human race 
  knows nothing worth knowing about the biosphere and carbon dioxide.  If he's 
  right, we've been utterly ignorance throughout the twentieth century about the 
  most basic facts of planetary life.
