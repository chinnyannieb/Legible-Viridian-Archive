"Summer Health Warning?"  Yeah. You no doubt heard about  New York City's July 
4th episode of selective Con Ed  Service.  The Washington Heights/Inwood area == 
heavily  populated by retired elderly, working-class blacks, and  immigrant 
Dominicans == was first browned out, then  blacked out for three days during 
that 100 degree  heatwave.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  You're talking rows and rows of four and six-floor  walk-ups here, without 
  light, water, phones or  refrigeration for an average of 3 days.  No subway 
  service  from 145th street to 200th street.  The cops occupied  those blocks for 
  three days, store owners camped out in  front of stores with shotguns.  People 
  slept on city  benches when they could.  It looked like Beirut.  Despite  the 
  fact that Con Ed admitted to targeting that area to  "save" the rest of the 
  (more upwardly mobile) city grid,  there were no riots. I guess people were too 
  hot.       Did the city provide ice water and fresh milk to the  residents?  No, 
  just lots of cops.  The media and the city  have still not released any numbers 
  about heat stroke  deaths from that period, even though they will admit to  6000 
  residences being affected.  (By 6000, they mean 6000  buildings, not people).  
  This is what New York under  Giuliani does in a heat crisis.

Warning" to envision slapping up their  posters in the above-described 
circumstances.)))

  A message to let people know what I have been working  on  for Burning Man as a Viridian art project. Thanks to  the generosity of Intel (yes, Intel) we are trying to  build a kiosk. Intel has already bought me a flatscreen.  We are looking at designing a kiosk to house the  touchscreen and the laptop. We hope to have the kiosk  running continually off solar energy, with a past,  present, and future (loosely) realtime 3-d simulation of  the Utah desert, in which we will be for a week. Hopefully  we will have a 3-d version of the cuddly Viridian Mascot  "Big Mike" in all scenes, plus some scary scenes of green  Sport Utility Vehicles.  People will be able to fly around  the scene with touch, an interface which is already  working with the Virtual Hawaii project:  <A HREF="http://www.washedashore.com/">http://www.washedashore.com/</A>  (follow the links)

whose code we will probably use. NO MENTION OF INTEL IS  REQUIRED.   More 
announcements later.

(((Viridians who plan to attend Burning Man and want to  "dominate the playa" 
are strongly urged to contact  Cassandra directly.)))

(((Domes are likely doomed by their inextricable 60s- commune vibe.  As Stewart 
Brand pointed out when he became  disenchanted with Fuller geodesic domes, their 
acoustics  are wrong, and they leak all the time, and they have no  straight 
walls and corners where you can park conventional  furniture.  Plus, domes can't 
"learn," in the sense that  you can't hook new porches and second storeys on to 
them.

  Yet here at <A HREF="http://www.wco.dom/~domes">http://www.wco.dom/~domes</A> we have some  guy who follows the suspiciously Viridian-sounding  practice of <b>blowing up huge balloons,</b>  and then walking  inside them and spraying them with shot concrete. No leaks  and no geodesics == just a monster permanent bubble shaped  like a half-blimp.  Apparently you can built a <b>weird  giant froth</b> of interlocking soap-bubble structures, if  you go after it with insulation and reinforcing rods.  If  these structures would only "embrace decay" and fall down  into harmless mulch in five months, then we Viridians  would have a tremendous housing technology for (a) desert  culture festivals and (b) horrific weather disaster  encampments.  And that would be useful.   Because in the  future, it'll be harder and harder to tell the difference.
