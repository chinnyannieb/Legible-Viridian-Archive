<HR>
This contest is now closed.<BR>
A winner will be announced shortly.
<HR>
<P>
As I remarked earlier concerning the many artful entries
in this Summer Health Warning contest,   "This would
probably make a lovely two-page magazine spread of some
kind, if not for the sheer tedium of contacting all the
artists and engaging in pernickety contract negotiations
over copyright issues."
<P>
Jay Babcock (jabybab@mindspring.com*) agrees. "I would be
happy to run such a two-page magazine spread in the
magazine I'm now editing == Mean magazine, a full-color,
glossy, 80-page, internationally distributed, quarterly
magazine, devoted to, er, hipster and subversive pop
subculture. If you know magazines, think 'Grand Royal'
plus 'Mojo' plus 'Film Threat.' Brand new issue has a 22-
page Peter Sellers cover feature.  Our next issue comes
out in late November, then we're going bimonthly in 2000.
<P>

  Jay Babcock continues: "Like yourself, I don't have

the time/energy to do twenty-plus email negotiations,
contracts, payments, etc.  My hunch was these fine
Viridian artists would be into doing this FOR FREE. I'd be
happy to handle all the individual emails/TIFFs/etc. that
might come my way.   It's for a good cause.  We at MEAN
are not a money-making magazine (far from it!), so we can
scarcely be accused of capitalizing off their artistic
efforts.  It seems to me that getting this stuff published
in a full-color mag fulfills some part of the Viridian
mission."
<P>
(((Bruces continues:  We're into dodgy territory once
again, so here's the deal.  We Viridians traditionally
flinch at encouraging these well-meaning, pro bono,
public-spirited contest efforts on the Internet, and then
turning them into sordid, revenue-generating, real-world
publications.  It's not the money, believe me.  There
never is very much money, and even a lot wouldn't be half
enough to repay the ghastly administrative burden of all
that <strong>attention.</strong>
<P>
(((Nevertheless, those fine posters <strong>would</strong> make a rather
handsome magazine spread.  So, the decision is up to you
== not me, and not Jay Babcock.  If you designed one of
those lovely posters, and you want to have your work
featured in MEAN magazine FOR NO PAY, that is YOUR
DECISION.  You'll have to contact Jay Babcock YOURSELF
(<A HREF="mailto:jaybab@mindspring.com">jaybab@mindspring.com</A>), and you have to tell him it's all
right.
<P>
(((If enough of you artists choose to do this, we'll
presumably have a lovely Viridian spread in this glossy
magazine.  If you're not paying attention, though, it
won't happen.)))

<HR>
<P>
(((A new state law went into effect in Texas yesterday.
It introduces something akin to market competition into
the state's vast, sprawling utility business.)))
<P>
"September 1, 1999
<P>
<BR>
"U.S. Newswire via NewsEdge Corporation : AUSTIN, Texas,
Aug. 31 /U.S. Newswire/ == Few bills passed by the 76th
Texas Legislature will affect as many Texans as Senate
Bill 7, the Electric Competition Act. The law goes into
effect Sept. 1 (...)
<P>

  "The Electric Competition Act, which both houses of

the Legislature passed with overwhelming majorities,
requires most investor-owned utilities to freeze rates on
September 1, 1999, until January 1, 2002. At that time,
residential customers will receive a 6 percent rate
reduction.
<P>

  "The rate freeze is the first of many steps the

industry will take while making the transition to a fully
competitive retail electric market. (...) Electric
restructuring has also spurred new investment in Texas,
generating capacity as well as aggressive plans to meet
new environmental standards.
<P>

  "State officials predict a significant population

growth in the years to come, which will create a growing
demand for electricity. According to the PUC,
approximately 30 electric generating facilities are either
under construction or planned for the near future.
<P>

  "The Electric Competition Act requires electric

utility companies to eliminate 50 percent of nitrogen
oxides and 25 percent of sulfur dioxide emissions
statewide == the equivalent of removing almost 4 million
vehicles from Texas roads. The law requires electric
companies to achieve these reductions from grandfathered
plants by May 1, 2003, or cease operations of those
plants."
<P>
(((What does this opaque screed mean?  If it turns out to
be significant, it's not because markets are a social
panacea.  It's mostly interesting because in the State of
Texas, traditionally, Big Oil <strong>is</strong> the state government.
There has never been any realistic division between the
interests of Texan government and the oil industry.
<P>
(((But nowadays, booming Texas is a net energy-importing
state. Our reliance on other people's oil costs us a lot
of money.  Texas also has a rapidly expanding population,
and excellent wind and solar resources.  Thanks to this
law, a crack has opened in the Texan oil/government
magalith, and it should now become physically possible for
Texans to buy green energy. And if that can become law
here, it can happen anywhere. We'll be watching
developments.)))
