Links: John Zero (jzero@onramp.net***) remarks: With the announcement in Note 
00082 that "Big Mike," our  beloved microbial Viridian Mascot, might make an  
appearance at Burning Man, I realized that my Viridian  Inactivism must end, and 
I should put up a downloadable  version of Big Mike on the web.<BR>
<P>
Small, efficient, scalable vector-art versions of Big Mike  are now available 
at:
<P>
<A HREF="http://rampages.onramp.net/~jzero/viridian/index.html">http://rampages.onramp.net/~jzero/viridian/index.html</A> or <A HREF="http://rampages.onramp.net/~jzero/viridian/bigmike.zip">http://rampages.onramp.net/~jzero/viridian/bigmike.zip</A>
<P>
These are in the very Viridian Adobe Illustrator EPS  format ("Less Mass, More 
Data"), so that anyone who wants  to can (with the proper tools) easily change 
Mike's color,  size, or appearance at will. He's bitmap-independent and  ready 
to be placed and output. I can't stand the idea that  others might be using 
crumply, scaled up bitmaps of Big  Mike for their own purposes, when they could 
be getting it  straight from the source, i.e. me. The clarity of our  message is 
dependent on the clarity of our reproduction, I  believe.

The Botanisphere:  a backyard fuel cell hothouse garden<BR>
<P>
Concept: Stefan Jones  (SeJ@aol.com^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*****?) Ad copy: 
Stefan Jones<BR>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  The Viridian Botanisphere offers a whimsical,  aesthetically interesting 
  application for the waste heat  and carbon dioxide produced by a household fuel 
  cell.    The Botanisphere is a moist, warm, sheltered hothouse  suitable for the 
  cultivation of exotic flowers, herbs and  even small fruit trees.
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    The Botanisphere is a tipi-shaped structure,  constructed of sturdy carbon 
    fiber spars and panels of  flexible transparent plastic.  Standing three to five 
     meters high (depending on model), it nestles squarely over  a fuel cell unit.  
    Zippered slits in the plastic shell  allow maintenance personnel easy access to 
    the generator.
    <P>
    Mounted between the spars, in a rising spiral  around  the inside of the 
    "sphere," are a series of trough-shaped  planters fitted with trickle watering 
    system. Slits in the  walls of the Botanisphere allow plants to creep out into  
    the open air.
    <P>
    Sprouting from the vertical spars are arched internal  supports mounted with 
    numerous hooks. An included gaff  pole allows for easy placement and retrieval 
    of potted  plants hung on these. Most Botanispheres are large enough  to shelter 
    a potted tree or two on the ground next to the  fuel cell.
    <P>
    The Botanisphere includes a system which regulates  the hothouse through 
    computer-controlled misters and  ventilation slits. Reservoirs for fluid 
    fertilizers are  also available; these can be set to drip their contents  into 
    the watering system.  Properly configured, the  Botanisphere can run itself for 
    months at a time.  During  some seasons it may be advisable to ask a neighbor to 
     harvest all the fruits and vegetables.
    <P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  While many would welcome the prospect of homegrown  miniature bananas and 
  orchids, the most popular  Botanisphere mode is a small, exotic backyard rain 
  forest,  seeded with a random box full of turf, seeds, and beetles  FedExed from 
  the hottest, wettest stretches of the Amazon.  These miniature jungles are so 
  chic that most home owners  have their fuel cell plants installed in the front 
  yard,  in plain view of neighbors.

Why it's not Viridian: 
      <P>
* It's a heap of specialized, durable gadgetry and  structural materials that 
won't easily degrade.
<P>
* If the Greenhouse Effect really gets kicking, the last  thing you may want or 
need is a place to grow hothouse  plants.
<P>
Why it's Viridian:
<P>
* It turns what will probably be a utilitarian eyesore ==  a back yard fuel cell 
plant == into something  aesthetically pleasing.
<P>
* The plants in it will suck up some CO2 and water vapor.
<P>
* It's an upscale, vaguely ludicrous, showy thing that  will appeal to the 
leisure conscious and the wealthy: the  Viridian target demographic.
