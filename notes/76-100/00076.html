        Tor Kristensen tor@araneum.dk^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^***?</P>

      <P>Sources: <a href="http://www.fortune.com">FORTUNE</a> magazine December 

        01998</P>

      <P>When you're baking in inhuman heat beneath an angry sky, <BR>

        just as, for instance, millions of inhabitants of the East <BR>

        Coast of the United States are doing as I write this, the <BR>

        carbon dioxide problem can seem monstrous and unstoppable. <BR>

        After all, the planet's entire atmosphere has been soiled. <BR>

        There's no place left for anyone to hide. It's easy to <BR>

        feel helpless and to become very paranoid.</P>

      <P> No entity anywhere seems to be helping climate matters <BR>

        much. Especially in politics. The National Wildlife <BR>

        Federation's *Conservation Directory* (44th edition) lists <BR>

        no fewer than 3,000 government and private environmental <BR>

        groups, in the USA and Canada alone. Many of them have <BR>

        been beavering along in the halls of power for decades <BR>

        now. Yet we're still roasting in our own exhaust spew, <BR>

        just like the turkeys we are.</P>

      <P> But in fact, to date, CO2 has never become a central <BR>

        political issue. The Kyoto treaty is buried under the US <BR>

        Senate's carpet. Even the political anti-Kyoto forces, <BR>

        (and there are plenty of them with plenty of funds) are <BR>

        very much fringe amateur small-fry, power-politically <BR>

        speaking. Before I tear into the anti-Kyoto groups as if <BR>

        they were causing the end of the world (as in point of <BR>

        fact they may be), it's useful to put CO2 politics into a <BR>

        broader political perspective.</P>

      <P> We'll stick to an American political perspective for <BR>

        the time being, because I haven't found good data yet for <BR>

        other juridictions, and the Americans clearly play a <BR>

        major, starring role in the planet's CO2 crisis.</P>

      <P> Who actually runs the American political system? <BR>

        Could it be CIA/NSA/FBI? The Military-Industrial Complex? <BR>

        Freemasons? The ultra-rich? The Skull and Bones Society? <BR>

        The 4,312 guys on the grassy knoll who shot Jack Kennedy? <BR>

        Alas no!</P>

      <P> In December 01997, FORTUNE magazine took the <BR>

        trouble to conduct a formal poll of members of Congress, <BR>

        Congressional staffers, and White House officials. The <BR>

        magazine, aided by two professional pollsters, asked 2,200 <BR>

        politicians to rank American interest groups in terms of <BR>

        their political clout. These were America's top <BR>

        politicians, talking about the people who tell them what <BR>

        to do. Who can get their way from the US government? Who <BR>

        do American politicians fear to cross? Who really compels <BR>

        their political attention?</P>

      <P> Interest groups have their ups and downs, just like <BR>

        all other aspects of industrial democracy. It's only a <BR>

        year and a half since the FORTUNE poll though, and we're <BR>

        still in the same Administration. So this is a viable <BR>

        snapshot of the American political landscape, seen from <BR>

        the top of the system.</P>

      <P> FORTUNE did the ranking, but I'm doing my own helpful <BR>

        commentary. I hope that non-Americans may find this list <BR>

        of particular use.</P>

      <P>1. American Association of Retired Persons<BR>

        lose by government subsidy.<BR>

        5. Association of Trial Lawyers of America<BR>

        The privileged legal caste. They know how legislators <BR>

        think and act because many of them are future, current or <BR>

        former legislators.</P>

      <P>6. National Rifle Association of America<BR>

        Notoriously zealous American armed-populace freaks and the <BR>

        industries that supply their ammo. The classic single-<BR>

        issue pressure group.<BR>

        7. Christian Coalition<BR>

        TV-satellite evangelical empire. Good at grass-roots <BR>

        attacks on Republican party structure.<BR>

        19. National Association of Home Builders of the U.S.<BR>

        Home construction industry.<BR>

        20. National Association of Broadcasters<BR>

        of Presidential candidates.<BR>

        Food/entertainment industry.<BR>

        25. International Brotherhood of Teamsters<BR>

        Large,scary labor union notorious for organized-crime <BR>

        ties.</P>

        might have any direct interest in CO2 issues.<BR>

        27 Independent Insurance Agents of America<BR>

        Insurance industry.<BR>

        28 National Retail Federation<BR>

        30 Health Insurance Association of America<BR>

        USA is unique in having no government health policy, <BR>

        creating anomolous boom situation among medical lobbyists.</P>

      <P>*31 American Automobile Manufacturers Assn.<BR>

        Auto lobby. Major CO2 greenhouse interests.<BR>

        32 Blue Cross and Blue Shield Association<BR>

        Yet more medical lobbyists.<BR>

        33 Business Roundtable<BR>

        Ultra-wealthy business caste.<BR>

        34 National Beer Wholesalers Association<BR>

        Drug industry, heavily regulated, still remembers <BR>

        America's "noble experiment" with alcohol prohibition.<BR>

        35 Natl. Com. to Preserve Social Security and Medicare<BR>

        Elderly demographic group protecting cross-generational <BR>

        subsidies.</P>

      <P>*36 National Automobile Dealers Association<BR>

        Car salespeople. They sell large devices that spew CO2.<BR>

        *37 Sierra Club<BR>

        First environmental group on the list, finally in at <BR>

        number 37. Old, wealthy, well-organized. But you could <BR>

        fill a banquet hall with powerful Washington lobbyists <BR>

        before the first environmentalist got a Birkenstocked foot <BR>

        in the door.<BR>

        38 American Federation of Teachers<BR>

        Another teacher's lobby.<BR>

        39 Pharm. Research &amp; Manufacturers of America<BR>

        Pharmaceutical lobby.<BR>

        40 Children's Defense Fund<BR>

        Social-welfare lobby beloved of Hillary Clinton and <BR>

        others.</P>

      <P>*41 American Petroleum Institute<BR>

        The first Washington lobby that can be unhesitatingly <BR>

        classified as a Viridian class-enemy, with direct <BR>

        responsibility for climate damage, and compelling, <BR>

        unavoidable reasons to damage more and more.<BR>

        42 American Insurance Association<BR>

        Yet another insurance lobby.<BR>

        43 NARAL<BR>

        Reproductive rights zealots.<BR>

        44 American Council of Life Insurance<BR>

        More insurance.<BR>

        45 Recording Industry Association<BR>

        American global music entertainment complex.</P>

        Legal caste.<BR>

        Postal employee lobby.<BR>

        50 Tobacco Institute<BR>

        Nicotine drug industry.</P>

      <P>So much for the top fifty power players. As you can see, <BR>

        climate scarcely ranks at all. This is not without its <BR>

        benefits, as, if things work out the way we Viridians hope <BR>

        they will, climate will quickly cease to matter <BR>

        politically. We don't *want* a permanent political <BR>

        interest in CO2 issues. That might be fatal. If climate <BR>

        spins so drastically out of control that climate becomes a <BR>

        long-term, central political crisis, it probably means <BR>

        catastrophe for civilization. </P>

      <P>Just for fun, here's a swarm of the following fifty minor <BR>

        players, where the situation remains very the same.</P>

      <P> You'll notice that the "Viridian Design Movement" is <BR>

        nowhere listed. But on the other hand, neither is the <BR>

        "Global Climate Coalition," with their vile assertions <BR>

        that CO2 is just great for Mom and apple pie. It's still <BR>

        hand-to-hand battle among small clusters of savages, out <BR>

        on the CO2 frontier. And with luck, it will stay that way <BR>

        until no one has to worry about it any more.</P>
