THEY'RE HERE! The first Viridian designed-and-manufactured
object!  It's a Viridian T-shirt, designed by
"Team Zebra Mussels" of the Viridian Curia:
"Alex Steffen"<BR>
(steffen@eskimo.com^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^******?)
"Laura Stinson" (lstinson@empathy.com^^^^^^^^**?)
"John J. Kovach IV" (JOHNZBRAIN@aol.com^^**?)
"Brad Bulger" (tater@Catch22.com^^*?) and
"Bob Morris" (bobmorris@mediaone.net^^^^^?).
Soon we'll be shipping and selling them!

(((Garth Coogan remarks:  This development seems pretty
Viridian to me, though I wonder with what they could
replace those depleted-uranium cannon shells, with their
nasty leftovers.)))

"The American army has recently declared that it will
issue lead-free bullets to its soldiers as part of a move
to what it calls 'green ammunition.' Rather than pricey
platinum, however, military researchers have hit upon
tungsten metal as a replacement for lead.  They have
developed two tungsten mixtures == one with tin and
another with nylon == to substitute for lead in the
standard 5.56mm service round for M-16 rifles.
<P>
<P>
"Soon, they will replace the ammunition used in all
small arms.  The attraction of tungsten, which is commonly
used in light-bulbs, is that it is weighty enough to do
damage, but, unlike lead, is non-toxic.
<P>
<P>
"That  matters because military men, too, have to
think about the environment == particularly the
environment of firing ranges where, in these relatively
peaceful days, most ammunition is spent.  The problem is
that bullets usually shatter on impact.  As round after
round of this shattered ammunition accumulates, the
resulting debris can turn the soil toxic, or ooze its way
into the groundwater.
<P>
<P>
"The cost of cleaning up this mess is the reason
behind the shift to non-toxic bullets.  High lead levels
have already forced the National Guard, America's military
reserve, to suspend the use of more than 800 of its indoor
firing ranges.  Removing lead from just one naval range
cost over $2.5m.
<P>
<P>
"As for performance, officials say that field testing
shows the switch to tungsten will require no sacrifice.
In fact, they claim optimistically, early results suggest
that in some applications such as long-distance shooting,
tungsten bullets may be better than leaden ones."

(((Bruce S remarks: this anonymous clipping sounds
plausible, and it would seem to be an interesting
harbinger. The 21st century's native versions of Green
needn't bear much resemblance to the peaceable Green
shibboleths of the 20th.  Who would have predicted, for
instance, that Germany's first Green foreign minister
would help lead a European shooting war?  Or that loud
cries of spreading environmental damage would be primary
war-propaganda from the Serbian regime?
<P>
<P>
(((There's something that feels extremely plausible in
a 21C Green warfare scenario.  A high-tech shooting war,
fought with Green military methods for environmental
reasons.  There you are, you see == on the losing side,
naturally == with your rusting AK-47 in your hand ==
crouched in your cruise missile-proof bunker ==
reluctantly ready to fight to the death to defend your
squalid little country's God-given sovereign right to fill
the planet's atmosphere with chlorofluorocarbons.  When
from over the dark horizon == in their laminated-bamboo,
fully recyclable black helicopters == here comes a swarm
of armored globalist cyborgs, who proceed to rend your
human flesh with high-speed streams of precisely-targeted,
<b>guaranteed non-toxic,</b> rifle fire.

(((Soon, your conquered backwater is under full
occupation by multinational cadres in orange
decontamination jumpsuits.  They're shutting down all your
dirty power plants, and scrapping all your internal-
combustion cars.. They're also recycling your trash (while
carefully searching through it for environmental war-
criminal evidence).  They're carrying out universal
vaccination campaigns, that double as DNA fingerprinting
dossiers.  They might claim legal backing from any of the
planet's various world governments: NATO, WTO, GATT, MAI,
UN, INTERPOL, Hague World Courts of Justice, NAFTA, GUUAM,
Kyoto, EC, Red Cross and Crescent, maybe even some eerie
globe-spanning network of self-appointed Non-Governmental
Organizations, who knows.  Who cares.  They're mean,
they're Green, they're in deadly earnest, and they're a
lot more technically advanced than you are.  It's over.
Put the gun down. Get a job.)))

"FORMER FIRST LADY MAY HAVE BONE MARROW TRANSPLANT. Raisa
Gorbachev, who is currently being treated for leukemia at
a Germany hospital, may soon undergo a bone marrow
transplant. 'The Moscow Times' on 20 August cited Russian
Public Television as reporting that the sister of the
patient, the wife of former Soviet leader Mikhail
Gorbachev, will be the donor. Raisa Gorbachev is reported
to be feeling 'slightly better' after the initial phase of
chemotherapy but will continue that treatment for two to
three weeks, dpa quoted her doctor as saying. Meanwhile,
'Moskovskie vedomosti' reported in its No. 32 (August)
issue that her sickness may be attributed to radiation
exposure during her youth. Raisa Gorbachev was born and
spent almost 20 years in Rubtsovsk, Altai Krai, just 100
kilometers from a site where the Soviet Union began
nuclear testing in the 1940s. Radiation levels there were
the same as those in the 'alienation zone' following the
1986 Chornobyl nuclear accident, according to the
publication."
