      <P>
The extraordinary summer heat of 1999 is killing  people in the American East 
Coast and Midwest.  We haven't  yet had a dire event to match the 600-person 
Greenhouse  massacre during the Chicago Heat Wave of 1995, but that's  because 
city managers are now getting used to the idea  that summer is lethal.
<P>
Heatwave deaths are highest among two classes, the  elderly and the poor.  The 
elderly poor are at especial  risk.  They can't afford air conditioning.  Since 
they're  old, they're absent-minded, they have poor eyesight and  limited 
mobility.  Being poor, they're commonly  semiliterate.  Plus, they're set in 
their ways.   Old  people spent most of their extensive lifespans living in a  
stable climate.  They're just not mentally prepared for   the climate of the 
1990s, where a single year usually  wreaks more violent weather havoc than an 
entire 20th  century decade.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  There is therefore a Viridian public service niche  for a simple, blatant, 
  very large, circus-poster which  bluntly informs elderly urban residents that 
  today's  unnatural heat will kill them.
  <P>
  This poster should not be some arty, elaborate  Viridian lithograph.  Like a 
  polio or smallpox quarantine  sign, it's for use in public health emergencies.  
  It needs  to be as simple and effective as possible. You have to  imagine your 
  target audience as someone who barely reads  English, and has no tolerance for 
  multi-part technical  lectures, Kyoto tracts, or hip, ironic in-jokes.  The  
  target audience wears trifocals, or perhaps has had a  recent cataract 
  operation.  This poster is meant for  someone for whom a trip to the grocery 
  store is a serious  physical challenge.  Someone for whom a flight of stairs  
  can mean a respiratory attack.   You have to catch their  watery eye and hold it,
   and get the warning across in  simple, bright patterns.
  <P>
  When you have created the text and graphics of your  Summer Health Warning 
  poster, put it on the web and send  me the address.  I will post it to the 
  Viridian list.
  <P>
  And now for the valuable contest prize.  The winner  of the Viridian Summer 
  Health Warning Contest will receive  a handsome, tasteful Texan cowboy hat, 
  highly suitable  gear for blistering, semi-tropical sun exposure.  This  chapeau 
  will purchased from an Austin, Texas, Western-wear  store, in your own personal 
  hat size.  It will be shipped  to you in a stout cowboy hatbox.
  <P>
  The deadline for this contest is: September 1, 01999. Good luck!<BR>
