Key concepts:  time stress, design for disassembly,<BR>
Viridian aesthetics, sunlight

(((bruces remarks:  since I have no time to  write a
Viridian Note today, this note is very apt.)))
<P>
From: tbyfield@panix.com^^^^^^^^^^^** (Ted Byfield)<BR>
Subject: Viridian time and light<BR>
<P>
An excellent Viridian design/engineering project would be
safe lighting.  A "safe" light should meet the following
Viridian criteria:
<P>
<P>
Infinitesimal energy consumption.  No toxic
ingredients whatsoever.  It should never burn out, or, if
it must, then separating its structure into easily
reusable/recyclable components should be as simple as
opening a bottle == just pop the top.
<P>
<P>
Since complex/compound products are notoriously
difficult to recycle, then that last criterion should be a
general goal of Viridian design.  It should be a trivial,
even satisfying exercise to break down a complex object
into simple component materials:  glass, metal, plastic A,
plastic B, rubber, etc. == which can then be reused or
recycled.
<P>
<P>
Any excessively complex object, whether 'necessarily'
complex (circuitboards) or 'gratuitously'complex
(decorated surfaces) should be discouraged.  Simplicity,
organization, segregation of materials, and minimalism
should be encouraged.
<P>
<P>
In a Viridian world, we should never see a big piece
of industrial junk sitting on the curb waiting to be
carted off.  Instead, we should see a series of bins
(mostly empty, of course) with various materials neatly
and correctly sorted into types.  Color-coding materials
by type might be helpful.   Would a house whose interior
looked like a gaudily painted San Francisco Victorian be
Viridian? I'd say yes.
<P>
<P>
It's easy to fall into the trap of assuming that the
"most Viridian" light is a problem for engineering and
design.  In fact, the most Viridian light is <strong>sunlight</strong>
(and the second most Viridian light is moonlight).
<P>
<P>
My own submission for 'the most Viridian
light' isn't a light, it's a clock.  Rather, it's an
anticlock, a way of thinking about time that encourages
people to content themselves with available light.
<P>
<P>
The 24/7 mania that's encircling the globe is not
sustainable.  It takes too high a toll on people and the
world.   Living, working, and playing by available light
<strong>is</strong> sustainable: that means that work will be less
productive in winter and more productive in summer.
<P>
<P>
That's a truth for farmers, and there's no reason it
can't be a truth for everyone else == manufacturers,
teachers, financiers... Stock exchanges will go up in the
summer and down in the winter.  Capital will flow from the
northern to the southern hemisphere and back again on a
cyclical basis, in harmony with the seasons and the fact
that earth is a sphere. Cycles of investment and
divestment will return to a proper function of supporting
real-world activity.
<P>
<P>
Bruce had it right in the fundamental insight that
the rise of frenetic, addle-brained acceleration is an
end-of-the-century phenomenon.
<P>
<P>
Consider the buzz one feels five minutes before one
has to walk out the door to, say, a dentist's appointment.
It's too much time to do nothing, but not enough time to
do anything productive.
<P>
<P>
When the millennium turns, the future will vanish.
We'll be left only with the present.  The difference
between the present and the future will collapse into the
difference between the present-as-it-is and the present-
as-it-should-be. This will be a very unstable, very
disorienting sensibility, and it will be <strong>crucial</strong> to
actively promulgate fruitful ideas about how to think
about time.  Time <strong>isn't</strong> money, time is <b>light</b>.
Working with available resources is a way that 'globally'
reduces power consumption.  It also promotes a sustainable
and creative aesthetic sense of the world we're making.
<P>
<P>
(((bruces remarks:  I like this very much, but would
like to put in a word for sustainable gratuitous
complexity.  Devices designed-for-disassembly should
probably be <strong>more</strong> complicated than "simple" devices of
"simple" components.  The closer a device lives to Moore's
Law, the more design intelligence should be invested in
having it auto-explode into Viridian "planned
evanescence."
<P>
<P>
(((The notion of living in an entire home color-coded
for spontaneous disassembly sounds a tad scary.  The past
and future really <strong>would</strong> disappear in that environment,
and the home-owners would probably find themselves
contemplating the children as a marketable collection of
valuable medical spare parts.
<P>
<P>
(((As a futurist, I find myself increasingly
confronting the phenomenon of the future vanishing into
the present. Wild speculations of mine are constantly
popping up as actual physical objects.  But it can be a
useful sensibility, not at all "destabilizing."   I can
live with this quite happily, once I fully realize that
the future is <b>already here</b> == it just isn't well
distributed yet.  As a futurist, I don't have to deal with
any <b>absolute,</b> Cartesian future == I merely need to be
somewhat ahead of my own audience.
<P>
<P>
(((At the moment, with a mad travel schedule, solar
panels sprouting on my roof, and a French TV crew in the
house, in the wise words of the proverb, "I have so much
to do that I am going to bed."  Viridian Inactivism
definitely has its merits.  While we're renouncing
everything harried and frenetic, how about a soothing
glass of Fetzer wine?  California, here I come!)))
<P>
CALIFORNIA WINERY TO BUY ALL-GREEN ENERGY
One of the largest wine makers in the United States has
decided to run all its operations from electricity that is
generated by renewable energy. Fetzer Vineyards in Hopland
is the first wine producer in the world to purchase 100%
of its power from green energy.  It will purchase five
million kWh a year under a long-term contract with PG&amp;E
Energy Services, the retail unit of the utility PG&amp;E.
Fetzer is the sixth largest wine maker in the U.S. and its
Hopland winery is the largest wine production facility in
Mendocino County. It bottles 3.5 million cases of wine a
year.
