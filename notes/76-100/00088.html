(((Kim Allen remarks:  Take a look at this article.  What we have here is a 
weather-caused breakdown of our carefully constructed separation between humans 
and the rest of nature.  Especially in the suburbs, we have become accustomed to 
controlled surroundings that do not include natural phenomena like bears.
<P>
(((This article also demonstrates our complete unpreparedness for dealing with 
such breaches of our walls == really, shouting at bears like "chasing an 
unwanted dog"??  Will we soon be repelling mountain lions like stray cats, and 
vultures like pesky pigeons?  Maybe we'll need a special branch of urban 
wildlife police. == Kim Allen)))

"Drought Pushing Bears Into Big City Suburbs
<P>
By David Morgan
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    "PHILADELPHIA (Reuters)  Drought is forcing so many black bears to rummage 
    for food in the suburbs of New York and Philadelphia that Pennsylvania Thursday 
    issued a public advisory on how suburbanites should cope with the large but 
    timid creatures.
    <P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  "State officials said nearly 2,400 bear sightings have been reported so far 
  this year in eastern Pennsylvania and northern New Jersey, particularly in 
  upscale residential areas near the Delaware Water Gap, about 60 miles west of 
  Manhattan.
  <P>
  "In New Jersey, sightings have nearly doubled from last year, mainly because 
  of an exploding bear population that numbers about 10,000 animals between the 
  two states.
  <P>
  "Famished bears broke through kitchen screen doors at two homes around 
  Stillwater, New Jersey, and one actually raided the refrigerator for a free meal 
  of eggs and butter. Unusual sightings also have been reported in Maryland, where 
  police spotted a bear only 10 miles from downtown Baltimore. 'Bear sightings are 
  not uncommon at this time of year,' said Gary Alt, the Pennsylvania Game 
  Commission's black bear biologist. 'And, if drought conditions worsen, 
  Pennsylvanians are likely to see more bears as natural food sources wither.'
  <P>
  "Weighing up to 600 pounds and hungry for anything from birdseed and insects 
  to carrion and grass, black bears have seen their usual fare of blueberries and 
  other wild fruits stunted by the driest growing season in at least a generation.
  <P>
  "Dry conditions also have withered farm crops, which in other years might have 
  limited the bears' wanderings to rural areas. As a result, suburban trash cans 
  have become potential horns of plenty just as bears need to fatten up for 
  winter.
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    "The five-point advisory issued by the Pennsylvania Game Commission 
    suggested people make sure not to leave garbage, table scraps or pet food 
    outside overnight. It also asked that bird feeders be taken down, describing the 
    seed-laden fixtures as 'bear magnets.'
    <P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
"'If a bear shows up in your backyard, stay calm. Shout at it like you would to 
chase an unwanted dog,' the advisory said. If that fails to work, call the 
commission or the police."  (...)

"Kazakhstan plagued by fleas
<P>
By Central Asia Correspondent Louise Hidalgo
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "The Kazakhstan authorities announced a state of emergency in the western city 
  of Aktau following an invasion of fleas.
  <P>
  "Local authorities say 40% of houses and apartment blocks in the city are 
  infested and that there is not enough money to disinfect them.
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    "It follows the discovery of three cases of bubonic plague in a village in 
    the same region after villagers ate what is believed to have been an infected 
    camel.
    <P>
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  "The town of Aktau lies on the shores of the Caspian Sea, on the far western 
  tip of Kazakhstan. To the east of the town is desert and local officials say the 
  hot summer weather has combined with a lack of fresh water supplies to provide 
  an ideal breeding ground for the fleas.
  <P>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    "They say two out of five ground-floor apartments in the city are now 
    infested and that in some areas the situation is so bad that sanitation officers 
    are refusing to venture into the worst affected  buildings.

Subject: Viridian Disasters: Urban Sewage Spills<BR>
<P>
(((Richard Puchalsky remarks:  Here's part of a press release about sewage 
spills.  The committee concerned with them has already decided that sewage 
spills connected to extreme weather are "unavoidable" in terms of liability.)))
<P>
(((Bruce Sterling remarks:  Here we have a theoretical sighting of a Wexelblat
-style Viridian Disaster, a disaster which occurs when Greenhouse weather 
violence overwhelms the designed limits of human infrastructure, causing a 
secondary, human-assisted, unnatural disaster as human systems rupture.  In this 
case, urban functionaries are struggling with the federal government to get off 
the hook when their vile effluent spews onto innocent third parties.  The 
problem?  Rain and floods.  The solution?
Simply write bad weather off the books!  Could this become a "solution" to the 
problem of the world "becoming uninsurable"?  City budgets will maintain an 
eerie calm, while everyone downstream slowly begins to stink, finding no legal 
or financial recourse.)))

"Press Release
<P>
"Environmentalists Criticize Walkout by Municipalities, Treatment Plant 
Operators Over Sewage Spill Regulations
<P>
"Representatives of municipalities and sewer system operators walked out  of a 
Federal Advisory Committee yesterday, claiming that the  Environmental 
Protection Agency (EPA) was not offering them broad enough protection from 
liability for spills and overflows of raw sewage.  They  now appear to be 
planning to wage a fight in the Congress rather than  working with the Federal 
Advisory Committee to try to resolve questions  of how to fix, and take 
enforcement action against, illegal raw sewage  discharges. (...)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "The Committee was meeting this week to talk about how to deal with illegal 
  releases of raw sewage.  These releases from sewer lines and collection systems 
  (called Sanitary Sewer Overflows or SSOs) are a widespread, serious problem.  It 
  is estimated that at least 40,000 significant SSOs occur each year in the United 
  States.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Because raw sewage contains a complex mixture of bacteria, viruses, pathogenic  
organisms, toxic chemicals, pesticides, bioactive drugs, nutrients and  
household and industrial wastes, SSO releases can result in contamination of 
drinking water, illness, closed shellfish beds,  polluted beaches, fish kills 
and other ecosystem damage.  Most of these  sewage spills are caused by 
overloaded sewer systems (the pipes get too  full) or by maintenance problems. 
(...)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <BLOCKQUOTE>
    "The committee also has recognized that some overflows,  such as those 
    caused by extreme weather or unforeseeable system  failures, are unavoidable.<BR>
    
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
According to the proposal being discussed,  treatment plant operators would not 
be held liable for such unavoidable  spills.  A dispute over the extent of 
operator liability triggered  yesterday's walkout."
