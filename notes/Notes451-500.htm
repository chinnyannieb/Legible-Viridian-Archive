for an audience of left-wing Britons.]</li>

<li> <a href="451-500/00469_those_world-killing_chinese.html" >00469: Those World-Killing Chinese</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>Understanding this Note requires some elementary math 
skills, in the sense that, for instance, one planet Earth isn't as big as four planet 
Earths.]</li>

<li> <a href="451-500/00470_clutching_at_straw.html" >00470: Clutching at Straw</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>It might take you a

a handy scorecard for the movers  and players in
the Global War on Terror green-fuels industry.
Believe it  or not, the fact that this industrial
transition is  almost, actually happening in real

there's even more.]</li>

climatic impacts on human history.]</li>

<li> <a href="451-500/00475_getting_real.html" >00475: Getting Real</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>A glum and comprehensive fit of handwringing as it dawns on everybody that matters that climate change is not just "an issue" but destined to become "the" issue. ]</li>

<li> <a href="451-500/00476_green_austin.html" >00476: Green Austin</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>I'm in Austin
a few days, and can't help but look around a little. ]</li>

<li> <a href="451-500/00477_worldchanging_the_book.html" >00477: WorldChanging: The Book</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>Pay attention.
This is important.]</li>

novel "The American Claimant" was published in
1892.  It involves a daffy American inventor trying

but that was news to me.]</li>

<li> <a href="451-500/00479_the_sulfur_cure.html" >00479: The Sulfur Cure</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>This proposition is

<li> <a href="451-500/00481_the_counterpurge.html" >00481: The Counterpurge</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>It's a notion
that may seem a little improbable at first glance,
but it's much less improbable than tornadoes in
London and  a lost war for oil.]</li>

<li> <a href="451-500/00482_big_changes_ahead.html" >00482: Big Changes Ahead</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>Happy new years...
these meditations by Washington-based pundit
John Peterson seem to reflect the current mood of the
times in the Beltway, which are about as dazed and
miserablist-apocalyptophile as one can imagine.
Looks like the world will be hit on the head
with a series of hammers until morale improves.
I'm having a lot of black-humored fun at this
guy's expense here, but I think he's dealing
with the season as best he can.
His newsletter FUTUREDITION is consistently amazing.]</li>

<li> <a href="451-500/00483_green_plutocracy.html" >00483: Green Plutocracy</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice: </b>Imagine yourself
spending Christmas websurfing for eco-doom, and

Lovecraftian cosmic fear.]</li>

the gray eminences of the Internet and the inventor
of Ethernet, explains to an audience of Massachusetts
politicos  why it will take thirty years to defeat
the Greenhouse Effect and by what means he expects
this to happen.]</li>

<li> <a href="451-500/00486_energy_policy_for_europe.html" >00486: Energy Policy for Europe</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>Who cares what a
bunch of Eurocrats say?  They don't even have  a real
Constitution!]</li>

<li> <a href="451-500/00487_we_are_winning.html" >00487: We Are Winning</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>The Viridian struggle
has met with success.  We are winning.]</li>

<li> <a href="451-500/00488_sublime_climate.html" >00488: Sublime Climate</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>Just 'cause we're winning, doesn't mean  we're dead

<li> <a href="451-500/00489_contests_and_prizes.html" >00489: Contests and Prizes</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b> you probably won't win these contests or these prizes.  Might be pretty fun to watch, though.]</li>

<li> <a href="451-500/00490_peter_schwartz_at_davos.html" >00490: Peter Schwartz at Davos</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b> You're basically at this guy's elbow as he goes to 
Davos to network with the Great and the Good.  There's a great deal of discussion there 
about the climate crisis and what to do about carbon.  Davos is the watering hole of the 
global plutocracy, so if you're interested in the tides and currents of planetary 
development, you're a lot better off reading this stuff than you are wasting your time on 
political blogs.]</li>

<li> <a href="451-500/00491_massive_green_buyout.html" >00491:  Massive Green Buyout</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b> Stuff like this is gonna start happening all the time. Might as well learn how it works and get used to it.]</li>

<li> <a href="http://www.viridiandesign.org/notes/451-500/00492_austin_green_capitlism.html" >00492: Austin Green Capitalism</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b> It's about a bunch of

<li> <a href="451-500/00493_british_military_describes_khaki_green.html" >00493: British Military Describes Khaki Green</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>keenly depressing, yet something of a tribute to Viridian foresight.]</li>

<li> <a href="451-500/not_a_viridian_note.html" >Not a Viridian Note</a>. [<b>Attention Conservation Notice:</b>an announcement probably pretty typical of the work I will be up to for the next seven months. It's about Italian cyberculture and design.]</li>
