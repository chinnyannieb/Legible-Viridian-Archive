For instance, Dr. Thomas J. Goreau and Wolf Hilbertz  of Global Coral Reef Alliance, have pioneered the use of solar panels to grow large limestone structures in the sea.  These sustainable structures might also protect shorelines from erosion and rising sea levels.   A forthcoming conference in September in San Francisco concerns   "Ecological Restoration of Public Lands:  Watershed Politics and Management, Community, Connection and Stewardship."   They plan to discuss ways to accomplish restoration on the personal level as well as the large scale.  It sounds promising.    I respect the goals of this organization.  They have inspired me to come up with a more "systems" approach to replanting the acreage my s.o. owns in Hawaii.  We want to reintroduce native vegetation. As a side note, I include:http://www.hawaii.gov/health/oeqc/eioegidx.htm    This is an interesting handbook for planting your backyard with native species in an attempt to restore a native ecosystem == at least on your own property. Many alien species in Hawaii are escaped  ornamental ones originally planted in gardens. However, I heard from park rangers on my trip to the big island this year that koa and  other native trees are making a comeback.Hope this helps,  Cassandra ThomasFrom:  Michael Goldhaber (mgoldh@well.com^^^**)Bruce,I  fully agree with  your idea of  urban wildlife refuges. Consider the sea lions, hundreds of them, who have decided to make their home at Pier 39 in San Francisco. Around here == semi-suburban Oakland == deer, raccoons, skunks, opossum, coyote and even mountain lions are making a return. It is not really a refuge of course, but merely a new kind of ecological niche many animals and plants can fill.  It is part of a new, humanly constructed bio-diversity that would seem to be the only realistic hope for the future.Michael Goldhaberhttp://www.well.com/user/mgoldh/From: Alex Steffen  (steffen@ems.org^^^^^^^^^^^^^^****)Re: Viridian Note OOO55:  Biodiversity MapsIronic, that when I pulled up the biodiversity map page, the first thing that loaded was a Subaru four-wheel drive ad of an SUV cruising over a meadow.alexFrom:  Steve Cisler (cisler@pobox.com^^^**)Re:  Note 00055 "..dwindling herds of the blue-tongued mango vole."Well, I saw a couple of these, but they were on a serving tray at Chez Butch's in Palo Alto.From AdrianC@frogdesign.com^* Re: Viridian Note OOO55:  Biodiversity Maps   "For the sake of breaking up the trance, there should have been one or two maps showing *expanding*  ranges for natural organisms in today's environment.   Zebra mussels, crabgrass and anopheles mosquitoes leap to mind, as do domestic fleas, Asian cockroaches and walking  catfish."There was a very good article in Harper's magazine about such expanding species: referring to them as "weedy" species. Weedy species are species that thrive in my different environments and tend to choke out their competitors and species in neighboring niches.Pigs in AustraliaGoats in the GalapagosRed foxes in CaliforniaAll sorts of plant species in Californiathe little fire antsOf course, the punchline of the article is that man is the ultimate weedy species. And maybe the only species that survive us will be species  that are similar to us in one important aspect == that they are able to adapt to many different environments and conditions.From: "Obstinately Persistent Idealist" (jczemek@ouray.cudenver.edu^*) Re: Viridian Note OOO55:  Biodiversity Maps     What, in your experience, is the breaking point of apathy in the average US citizen?   Does "art" lower this point faster/better than politics?  I suspect you think so, and that's (one reason) why you're trying to foster an art/design movement and minimize the political action aspect.  Admittedly, I've trouble remembering this on occasion, although I'd *rather* participate in a design movement myself (as it de-emphasises the defensive, hopeless stance you mention).      I just wonder what we could do as individuals along the lines of expanding urban biodiversity.  It reminds me of the guerrilla gardening note, and while it seems much more difficult, it also seems more worthwhile.  The Feds are having enough trouble reintroducing wolves to the wild; exactly which noncuddly species would stand a chance at surviving their urban transplanting?       Here in Denver, prairie dogs, which have generally been tolerated, are now under serious attack as plague spreading (laughable), eyesore-creating (??), horse-injuring (burrows on suburban spreads) nuisances to be deported to the plains, where of course the farmers also cite all the aforementioned complaints.  Don't get 'em started on what's to be done with such horrifying critters as coyotes and rattlers (personally, I'd LOVE to see them around).        If we can't even tolerate a relatively innocuous and fairly cute species like prairie dogs, how are we supposed to generate a mindset conducive to reurbanizing large/intrusive/reptilian critters? (I wish we could get past the mammal/raptor requirement for attracting public attention to an animal's plight)  I think the best way to catalyze this sort of thinking is to envision new city shapes: condensed, elevated, reintroduce the city wall as a growth restrictor and a wildlife barrier.    Or, taking the opposite extreme, no wall and no roads, with travel conducted along skyways ("futuristic," indeed) while wildlife occupy the ground level.  I think bison in the skyscraper (a new twist on "grain elevator", to be sure) sounds cool, but will it work if they continually stop traffic on the ground level?        It won't be enough to plan a wildlife refuge in the city; the city will have to plan around the wildlife, for we're the ones who'll be able to adapt to them.   The opposite will occur rarely, especially with the large/intrusive/venomous contingent.        This is certainly an interesting design challenge.  If you're considering the focus for the next contest, this is my vote. Joe--Astrolinguist, Marginal Prophet, & Nanoscale Chairborne VortexGlen Canyon Dam delenda est.(((bruces remarks:  if every wolf and rattler in Denver had an IP address and a global locator chip, they would soon be re-interpreted by city fathers as a major quality-of-life asset.)))
