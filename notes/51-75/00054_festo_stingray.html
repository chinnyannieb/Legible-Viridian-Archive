      <p>We still have a Russian entry on the way... This contest ends March 20, 
        01999. </p>
      <p> (((Bruce Sterling remarks: Festo is a German multinational specializing 
        in pneumatic control devices. They have a natural interest in unusual 
        applications for compressed air. Festo creates novel, large-scale inflatable 
        buildings (a process they call "airtecture"), which feature giant inflatable 
        Y-shaped beams, big inflatable girders, and computer controlled tension- 
        cables. Given these bizarre structures, apparently an aircraft somehow 
        came to mind. The Festo "Stingray," designed by a small Swiss company, 
        seems to be a fancy conceptual showpiece for Festo´s core competencies. 
        It is a translucent two-man aircraft made mostly of membranes, compressed 
        air, and computer-controlled wire. The Stingray is something like a rigid, 
        tough, high-tech, flying, intelligent, air mattress. With a little extra 
        development work, the Stingray would work and look much like the flying 
        soap-bubble of Glinda the Good Witch in THE WIZARD OF OZ. This aircraft 
        is nonmetallic, fibrous, and collapsible. It uses "less mass and more 
        data." Most Viridian of all, it consumes very little fuel. Every high-tech 
        CEO now fouling the skies with a fuel-hogging GulfStream should consider 
        floating serenely into town in one of these elegant devices.))) </p>

      <p>"Inflatable aircraft set for take off </p>
      <p>"OWNING an aircraft could become cheaper and far more convenient when 
        a new inflatable plane is launched. Trials of three new craft are taking 
        place in Germany to prove that conventional materials could be replaced 
        by lightweight polyester sheeting stretched across an aluminum frame. 
      </p>
      <p>"Festo, the Stuttgart manufacturer behind the trials, already markets 
        inflatable buildings and ballooning baskets. It says the unconventional 
        aircraft are being designed to prove that plastic sheet is safe and can 
        cut a third off the cost of owning and running a plane. </p>
      <p>"The most striking of the three designs is a delta- shaped plane called 
        Stingray that has already flown in tests for more than 250 hours. </p>
      <p>"Its name is derived from its unusual take-off method. First the pilot 
        must rev the two 28hp engines with the brakes on. He then presses a button 
        that releases a telescopic rod that strikes the ground and lifts the craft 
        two metres into the air. At the same time a computer releases the brakes 
        and Stingray is airborne, its engines moving it forward. The ´blended 
        wing´ design allows it to gain altitude. </p>
      <p>"Axel Thallemer, head of design at Festo, claims the craft is sturdy 
        and will not plummet to the ground if punctured. </p>
      <p>"´The sheeting can take several tonnes of pressure per metre," he says. 
        ´Also, the air inside the craft is not at a high pressure, particularly 
        at high altitudes, so if there is a tear it will not gush out instantly. 
        We estimate a pilot would have 30 minutes to land before the plane became 
        uncontrollable. It would be difficult to rip the lining because it is 
        incredibly strong. The yarn is made in a similar way to the material in 
        bullet-proof vests.´ (...) </p>
      <p>"´People don´t believe we can fly a plane with just two 28hp engines," 
        says Thallemer. ´But because the design is so light we can get away with 
        it.´ (...) </p>
      <p>"´We don´t know for sure if, after testing, Stingray will be launched 
        commercially. We are simply doing it to show that there is more to construction 
        than conventional materials. Air is all around us so it makes sense to 
        use it and cut down on weight.´ (...) </p>
      <p>"Festo is also testing an inflatable hang glider, called Pneumagic, and 
        an ultra-light single-seat plane, called Pneuwing. </p>
      <p>"Both have pumps that automatically inflate and deflate the polystyrene 
        covering that surrounds the aluminium fuselage. </p>
      <p>"Pneumagic has a nine-metre wingspan but when deflated it fits in a rucksack."

      <p>"The media talked about a ´flying stingray´ when Prospective Concepts 
        AG finally unveiled its secretive technology demonstrator in May 1998. 
        Stingray is indeed an appropriate name for the groundbreaking aircraft 
        designed by this small Swiss company. </p>
      <p>"The Stingray has a revolutionary wing that derives its rigidity from 
        compressed air. Later versions will be filled with helium. The second 
        radical concept developed especially for the Stingray is a pneumatic catapult 
        to be placed in the aircraft´s tail. (...) </p>
      <p>"As the founder and president of Prospective Concepts Andreas Reinhard 
        notes, the Stingray constitutes the high end in the use of pneumatic structures. 
        It is thus a showcase and the pioneer of a technology which uses high 
        strength fiber materials and air pressure as its components. With the 
        use of this technology, rigidity and flexibility can be combined, a union 
        that seemed contradictory up to now." </p>
      <p>The Festo Stingray was first brought to our attention by: </p>
