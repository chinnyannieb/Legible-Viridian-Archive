I have experience with one variety, the ones called 'active badges,' developed by Olivetti at itsCambridge (UK) research lab and elaborated by Olivetti and Digital Equipment.   "The classic active badge has about the area of a credit card and is about 8mm thick, in a housing of black plastic.  It has a single button on the front, plus an almost unnoticeable little infrared emitter and a similar little receiver.  Inside is a battery and a tiny circuit consisting mostly of a unique identity number in ROM. The badge responds with that number when it gets a signal, or when the button is pressed.    "Every second or so a ceiling-mounted box emits a low-powered infrared pulse, and every active badge in range responds with its identity.  The box then emits a message that says "I'm box A, and I have these badge identities in range: x, y, z, ...".  A computer collects that information and, on request, can tell you "Bruce Sterling [wearer of badge x] is in his living room [near detector box A]."     "People can be tracked all over a campus or factory; and since the computer knows where you are, it can see to it that your incoming phone calls ring where you *are.*  Suppose you don't *want* people to know where you are?  Simple: you hide your badge in your pocket, and you become invisible to the system.      "You can also glue active badges to valuable pieces of equipment, or better yet, build badges into their housings.     "This technology is quite old.  When last I was in contact with it, they were trying to make the devices smarter and smaller.       "So much for the Oh-Wow! factor.  Active badges haven't been a market success because, it turns out, people don't *want* to be locatable all the time.  People want to be able to be unlocatable without explicitly signalling that they're unlocatable, for reasons that may range from the mundane (using the toilet) to the clandestine (eating at restaurants instead of the company cafeteria).     "We have to think seriously about whether we really want to know where all our stuff is.  Suppose one's spouse discovers the existence of certain small, prized objects you've kept hidden since you bought them out of the petty cash.     "What would be the real repercussions of knowing where everything is?  There must be any number of second and third-order social problems that we would never discover without performing the experiment.    "Finally: real Viridian localizers would be intrinsically part of the objects localized, and would have more than one function.  In many cases, like the Viridian teapot, the tags would grow along with the object, or form within it like the crystalline interior of a geode.  They might cover the exterior like tiny buds.  The same for locator detectors.  After all, biology is much better at producing emitters and detectors than we are at designing them from scratch."(((bruces remarks:  No wonder these clunky "active badges" were a market failure: why the heck should I pay one thin dime to let *Olivetti* know where *I* am?   Furthermore, if some political regime dares to put an Orwellian locator dog-tag on me, then it's obviously time to raise the black flag and start shooting.  This "market problem" is a straightforward power question of who owns the means of information.  Power may be subtler nowadays, but  beware any digital consumer-marketing company that blithely offers to cheaply catalog everything you possess.)))(((Viridian Note 00070: The Coal-Burning Net, on the subject of how much CO2 is produced by the Net, aroused much response.)))From: Peter Denning (pjd@cne.gmu.edu^^^^^^^^*)"In Viridian Note 00070, you quoted a Forbes piece  quantifying the electrical consumption of computers. I've seen one or two other papers recently of the same ilk.  Many years ago, when people proposed founding paper journals about the coming age of paperless offices, I said 'The only difference between a computer and a book is the age of the trees.'  Others heard that as a quip, but now they are measuring it.From: Charles Raymond (craymond@northweb.com^*)    "I've never read Forbes magazine, but after this Viridian Note, I don't think I ever will.   *My* power is generated solely by moving water. Sixteen concrete-enclosed turbines, half of the project.  The other half serves Ontario.       "I have to wonder how many cubic tons of poison gas, liquid and solid pollutants are produced each month for the production of Forbes magazine. Not to mention the co-author's  personal web page, which wastes all that electricity.  And what happens to their publication after use?  Is every issue is recycled from the previous issue?  When incinerated, do the inks burn clean?  Ha!"From: Matthew Rubenstein (Matt@MediaServ.com^^^^^^*)     "The supposed scientific basis for that Forbes article is the 10/16/1998 *Science* paper titled "A Large Terrestrial Carbon Sink in North America Implied by Atmospheric and Oceanic Carbon Dioxide Data and Models."   But as even James Watt noted, trees (and the rest of nature) are a leading source of greenhouse gases.   Forest  that sink carbon  can also produce carbon (just as I live and breathe).      "Nutty amelioration schemes that teach a fish to bicycle seem to be the rising message of polluters.   A two-page glossy Chevron ad in a recent issue of *Harpers* magazine suggests that we should colonize undersea deserts with carbon-sucking lifeforms. This is clearly the way to follow up our success with rabbits in Australia and lampreys in the Great Lakes."From: Raul Miller (rdm@test.legislate.com^^^^^*)     "I noticed that this Forbes article assumes that there are several routers and such for each personal computer.  So why are PCs cheap commodity items while routers aren't?"From: "Laura Stinson" (lstinson@empathy.com^^^^^^^**?)"You know, I tire of this computer bashing, and I deem the stats quoted at Forbes to be of dubious credibility. Try these stats instead:"'...a heated water bed can consume more electricity than an efficient refrigerator. Altogether, the nation's water beds consume the electricity produced by two large power plants.'   "'Aquariums can be huge energy guzzlers == a 180-gallon coral reef tank can use more energy than a residential central electric heating system and refrigerator combined.'    "'We project that consumer electronics and halogen torchiere lamps together will account for 70 percent of the forecasted miscellaneous growth,' says Jonathan Koomey, leader of the Energy End-Use Forecasting Group....(http://www.ucsf.edu/daybreak/1998/08/25_elec.html)   "'The following ten product types (listed in priority order based on absolute projected growth==the first product listed having the highest forecasted energy growth) are projected to account for 60% of forecasted miscellaneous growth from 1996 to 2010:        Torchiere lamp        Color television        Dehumidifier        Security system        Compact audio system        Microwave oven        Projection television        Satellite television        Pool pump        Home computer ..."(http://enduse.lbl.gov/Info/LBNL-40295.pdf)(Note the absence of waterbeds and aquaria on the abovelist.)    "Seems to me that even if the dismal Forbes statistics were remotely close, we could still easily pay for our digital vice by giving up a few torchieres and televisions. (Don't even talk to me about heated swimming pools.)"From:  Jeremy Porter (jerry@freeside.fc.net*)      "This Note hits close to home, so I will admit to a bias here.  I worked at a Fortune 500 computer company not too long ago, and I worked with the  EPA 'Energy Star/Green PC program' at that company.      "This Forbes chart you cited declares  that non-Internet computer usage remains constant, while Internet computer usage grows.  How could that be?    Also, Internet use directly competes with other energy-using activities, such as automobiles and television.  If leisure time is constant, then Forbes fails to show that total CO2 levels are increased by Internet use.      "Forbes also declares:  'Under the PC's hood, demand for horsepower doubles every couple of years.'  This fails under the most simplistic examination.  PC's in 1994 before Energy Star mandates:  average power used by operational system, 50-100 watts.  Average power used by operational PCs today: 50-100 watts.           "At 17 watts, integrated chips give off so much waste heat that their ceramic carriers can crack from thermal expansion.  There are real limits to the amount of energy that cheap, lightweight, mostly plastic personal computers can use and burn off safely.  Power utilization has not increased in computers.  As for special purpose micro-controllers (which Forbes also decries).  these chips tend to dramatically increase energy efficiency in any machine they are installed in.     Forbes says 'Your typical PC and its peripherals require about 1,000 watts of power.(...) That kind of usage implies about 1,000 kilowatt-hours of electrical consumption in a year.'         "A normal PC power supply is rated at a maximum capacity of about 200 watts, and a large monitor (17in-19in) is about 100 watts maximum.  Typical utilization is about 25% when active, and power consumption can drop by 50% or more when idle.  Expected power utilization of a PC based on the (Forbes-estimated) 12 hour week (at 100 watts active) is 4,320,000 joules.  I  work this out to 1.2 kilowatt hours /week, or 62.4 kilowatt/hours/year.        "In other words, Forbes is  off by a factor of 16.   We should throw out their figures at this point.      "But there's better news yet.  Since most modern computers are Energy Star rated, idle power MUST drop to less than 50 watts for the chassis, 50 watts for the monitor and 25 watts for the printer, when idle.  I've seen designs that easily drop to 5 watts for the monitor, 2 for the printer, and about 10 for the PC.  Not only that, unlike a light bulb, the PC knows when it's idle and turns itself off.  You want to save energy?  Turn off your computer's energy-gobbling screen-saver, and  when you surf, turn off a light bulb and surf in the dark!    "If we had clean, smart Viridian power, Internet sites wouldn't need today's huge, uninterruptible power supplies.  They wouldn't need distant generators with tremendous conversion losses (10-20% or more).  Putting smart power into the electric grid would mean big savings in coal and oil.    "The old-fashioned electric utility grid has the same problems competing with the Internet that phone companies do.  Big centralized control networks  cannot be upgraded in a piecemeal fashion.  The control theory used for congestion avoidance and control is fundamentally incompatible with decentralized control.    "We need a Viridian Windows desktop theme with the trash can as a coal bucket."O=c=O O=c=O O=c=OSURF IN THE DARKO=c=O O=c=O O=c=O
