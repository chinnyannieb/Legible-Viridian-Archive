On the face of it, the Senator's act seems incredibly stupid, vindictive and pointless, and was promptly denounced as "unbelievable."       While politics are of tangential interest to the Viridian movement, it's important to understand why the US government has become so dysfunctional in climate issues. Why have even simple, "no-brainer" reform efforts that actually *save taxpayers money* become areas of partisan confrontation?      Why did Thad Cochran do this apparently ludicrous thing?  Let's speculate, shall we?       It would be too simple to denounce Senator Cochran as a corrupt puppet of the carbon-mining industries.  This kind of polarizing demogoguery is boring and counterproductive. It's been done to death.       Obviously the carbon industries are major players in the energy process. It could scarcely be otherwise.  For instance, the recent Interior Appropriations Bill (which Senator Cochran deliberately amended in order to frustrate the President), contains about 300 million dollars in Energy Department federal subsidies for oil and coal.          But the carbon industries don't own Thad Cochran.  Mississippi isn't Kuwait.  He's never been an out-and-out oil man, unlike, for instance, George Bush.   There's some oil and a whole lot of foul, soft-lignite coal in Mississippi, with mining representing maybe 2 percent of the state's economy, but Senator Cochran's main legislative interest is catfish farming.      Maybe the guy is just incomprehensibly mean-spirited.  Perhaps he hates Bill Clinton so much that, like many Republican zealots, he's willing to slash his own wrists to bleed on Clinton's shoes. But no.  Thad Cochran is a former Eagle Scout, a white-haired Baptist lawyer from Mississippi whose demeanour is commonly described as "courtly."  Cochran is the senior Senator from Mississippi, a career pol who wins his re-elections by large, cozy margins.  Cochran pre-dates the savage trench-warfare epoch of his junior Senator, Trent Lott, and the politically extinguished Newt Gingrich.  The Senator has been in power a long time.  He is not childish, and he doesn't make trouble merely for trouble's sake.      The Alliance to Save Energy artfully suggests that Senator Cochran is attempting to fleece the American taxpayer while stuffing fat back into the government.  If mere pork was the goal, Senator Cochran would be doing what he specializes in doing, i.e., rural Mississippi water projects.        No, Thad Cochran has two basic reasons to do what he did.  Defending the Senate's privileges, and ideological pressure.         First, the jealous Senate.  In introducing his amendment, the Senator irately declared that the President's action was a "thinly disguised effort to implement the Kyoto Agreement."   Why does he consider this a bad thing?  Because it makes the Senate into a potted plant, that's why.   The Senate believes it has already successfully dealt with Kyoto.  The Senate, in the bipartisan persons of Senators Byrd and Hagel, carried out a maneuver, back in 1997, called "putting the treaty in the parking lot."          The Senate didn't want a straight-up, confrontational vote on the Kyoto treaty, because this might cause political stress.  So, they simply stuck the treaty into permanent limbo, by passing the "Byrd-Hagel Resolution."  This resolution states, more or less, that the US Senate is not going to consider the Kyoto Protocol unless it's firmly established from the get-go that the United States comes out on top in the UN negotiations no matter what.       Byrd-Hagel is a silly resolution, but the text of the resolution isn't really important.   The resolution's formal text is just vapid  rhetorical dogfood for various economic and military American interest groups.   The point of the Byrd-Hagel resolution is to exploit the Senate's privilege to "advise and consent" on foreign treaties.        In practice, "advising and consenting" has become a procedural brake.  The Senate  can quietly pocket treaties, and do basically nothing, forever, while avoiding any serious political costs.  The legislative woods are full of vital yet uncertified international treaties stuck permanently in the US Senate, such as nuclear arms accords.  US Administrations and their State Departments, in despair, have come to act as if the treaties were in force anyway.       It is demeaning for the Senate to have their bluff called in this way.  It's highly irritating to have Bill Clinton do what little he can to behave as if the Kyoto treaty were in force.  Therefore, Cochran threw a procedural spanner into the works, by shifting the ground to a different area, where the Senate controls the purse strings.      Cochran's been made to look bad == after all, it's true that he is wasting money unnecessarily, and surprise amendments are always a cheap shot, and when you come right down to it, Senator Cochran is not a very bright man  == but he can afford it, and he probably considers the humiliation worth it.  His point was to make Clinton pay a price for encroaching on the balance of powers.     Then there's the second matter: rabid anti-Kyoto ideology.  I frankly doubt that Senator Cochran himself cares much about the substance of the Kyoto Accords one way or the other. He's never made a major issue of global warming, and the Senate has pretty well set it up so that he'll never have to take a public stand. But back home in Mississippi, the Republican Governor, Kirk Fordice, regards Kyoto as tantamount to foreign invasion and economic catastrophe. And the Governor has said so, loudly, and brought pressure on his state's Senators.     As we have stated in previous Notes (see Note 00009) we Viridians aren't big fans of the Kyoto Protocol.  Assuming the treaty is ratified (it won't be), even assuming it's efficiently enforced worldwide (it can't be), Kyoto is basically the industrial status quo of 1988, forever.  That is way, way too much carbon dioxide.  Kyoto's proposed scheme appears better than exploding growth rates in carbon dioxide, but Kyoto's bogus solution is nowhere near enough to get the planet off the hook.  Carbon use has to crash drastically, fast.  It has to wiped out by the same process that created it, industrial revolution.    Kyoto is a bland assertion, by 173 separate national governments, that rickety confederations can control global industry.  Kyoto is all about ration-tickets, caste systems, and national-boundary bailiwicks.  The Kyoto Protocol looks like a document from a vanished epoch.  Governments can't even control their own currencies any more, much less offshore maquilladoras and carbon moguls like Qaddafi and Saddam Hussein.  Even the well-organized and financed American government has blundered drastically.America's  best smog-control efforts gave rise to ghastly mutants like the Sport Utility Vehicle.       Kyoto represents alien political control of the untrammeled pioneer spirit of Henry Ford, Thomas Edison and John D. Rockefeller, legendary American culture-heroeswho  are, without question, the three sinister godfathers of the Greenhouse Effect.  The implications of Kyoto are just too much for certain people to take, and Kyoto is especially too much for particularly unpleasant, paranoid people.         In further Notes, we will examine some of Kyoto's most virulent enemies.O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=OI'M DIGGING COAL WITH MY RETURN KEYO=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O
