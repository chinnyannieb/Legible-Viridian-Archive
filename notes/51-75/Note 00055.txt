A winner will be announced shortly.**************************From: Rich Young (richyoung@hotbot.com^^^*)Rich Young remarks: Thought you'd like this site:http://tectonic.nationalgeographic.com/2000/biodiversity/maps/Track the dwindling species count in YOUR neighborhood!  Fun for the whole family!   Compare regional counts of various types of flora and fauna!(((bruces remarks:  Here's a laudable effort.  It has crude little interactive web-maps, you can zoom in on them a bit, you can scroll around in them, and you can bear witness to the appalling devastation suffered by North America's amphibians, birds, butterflies, crayfish, fishes, mammals, reptiles, snails, tiger beetles, unionid mussels and vascular plants.    (((The difficulty with a display of this kind is that it tells the same story every time.  We're always presented with fragile ecosystems, crumbling refuges, dwindling herds of the blue-tongued mango vole.  The public has been trained into a sense of learned helplessness by seventy years of anguished nature documentaries.  For the sake of breaking up the trance, there should have been one or two maps showing *expanding* ranges for natural organisms in today's environment.  Zebra mussels, crabgrass and anopheles mosquitoes leap to mind, as do domestic fleas, Asian cockroaches and walking catfish.    (((The defenders of wildlife seem to be stuck in a permanent defensive posture, crying out monotonously as the blows rain down.  One tires of this defeatist, refugee mentality.  We should make a mighty effort to visualize something else, something better.   Perhaps we'll live to see a *beachhead* mentality of *newly-established* wildlife areas. What would it take to build a wildlife refuge from scratch, right in the midst of the urban, built-up environment of the 21st century?  One wonders, for instance, what a high-rise grasslands might look like: say, an urban structure the size of the Chrysler Building where buffalo and antelope migrate via elevator.  Furthermore: having witnessed this big continental National Geographic biodiversity map, I'm eager to see the personal version, one for my own lawn, where I can do soemthing direct, constructive and immediate about the life and death of organisms.)))Rich Young (richyoung@hotbot.com^^^*)
