(...)    "Freeplay doesn't have to shout for attention. The company's booth is lined with a collection of stylish, transparent radios in eye-pleasing colors: wild cherry, lime, blueberry. They look as if they've been carved from giant Lifesaver candies. Each radio has a handle that, when wound up, generates the power to play the radio. There are no electric cords and no batteries. People can play these 'self-powered' devices, which sell for $79.95, for free == hence the name.      "'What's this?' asks a curious visitor, clad in a black T-shirt and jeans. 'An iMac radio?' A Freeplay staffer hands him a device. 'Wind it up,' she says. The man folds out the handle and turns it for 10 seconds. The chorus from 'Zoot Suit Riot,' by Cherry Poppin' Daddies, blasts from the speaker. The base of the handle, now retracted snugly against the radio's face, spins slowly backward as the gears == visible from the outside == turn kinetic energy into electricity. 'This is incredibly cool,' he says. 'Where can I buy one?'    "Meanwhile, an ocean away, in a tin-shack classroom in the South African province of KwaZulu-Natal, a Freeplay radio is attracting eager attention from a very different audience.  A group of kids is crowding around for an English lesson. In this part of KwaZulu-Natal, Zulu is the primary language, and electricity is a luxury, not a utility. Few residents can afford to buy batteries. And few teachers are fluent in English.     "Enter the Freeplay radio, donated by War Child, an aid organization based in London."(((bruces remarks:  "War Child" is Brian Eno's charity.)))    "War Child has purchased enough self-powered radios to help 150,000 South African children to learn English. (...)      "The company was formed in 1995, shipped its first product in 1996, has generated revenues of $20 million as of March 1999 == and expects to reach $35 million by 2000.  Freeplay's investors include General Electric Pension Trust; WorldSpace, a satellite-broadcasting company in Washington, DC; and Liberty Life, a top South African insurance company. The company's famous advocates include Nelson Mandela (who made an appearance at a Freeplay factory opening) and Jimmy Carter. Gordon Roddick, chairman of the Body Shop, serves on the board of the Freeplay Foundation. And Terry Waite, the former envoy of the Archbishop of Canterbury, who was held hostage in Beirut, is a trustee of the Freeplay Foundation.    "Waite has a decidedly personal connection to Freeplay's flagship product:   'I know what being cut off from communication is like. I spent five years in captivity, four of them in solitary confinement, during which time I got no news from the outside world. But near the end of my imprisonment, I did get a small, battery-operated radio. I was terrified that when the batteries died, the guards would not replace them, and I'd be back in total isolation. There are millions of people in this world who are in similar situations == cut off from the flow of information.'    "So although Freeplay's products have made a big splash in the rich countries == its radios ( along with the Freeplay Lantern, a self-powered flashlight that retails for $69.95 ) are available at RadioShack, the Sports Authority, REI, the Sharper Image, and Harrods, the London retailer == the radios are actually making a difference in the poorest countries. The United Nations Development Program used them to broadcast election results to the people of Liberia; the government of Ghana purchased 30,000 radios so that villagers there could also listen to the elections. War Child may distribute radios to refugees in Zaire, to warn them about land mines in that strife-torn country. And Rotary International plans to use the radios to broadcast information about a child-immunization project in India.     "(...) And its corporate agenda keeps expanding. 'We're not just in the radio business,' insists Rory Stear, 40, the company's cochairman and co-CEO. 'We are in the energy business.' (...)    "'We want to see self-powered products in every village and every city in the world,' adds Christopher Staines, 38, Stear's cochair and co-CEO at Freeplay. 'This self-powered technology is relevant, whether you're listening to a radio in Botswana, using a laptop computer in New Jersey, or hiking the mountains of Peru with a global-positioning system. That's our goal."(...)     "Inside each radio lies the heart of Freeplay's proprietary technology == a spring made of a two-inch-wide, 20-foot-long ribbon of carbonized steel. The spring is positioned so that turning the handle forces it to wind backward onto a bobbin. The force of the spring rewinding itself drives a set of gears, which in turn feed into an electric generator == a DC ( direct current ) motor powered in reverse. The electricity feeds from the generator into a circuit board, which regulates the rate of unwinding. Winding for 30 seconds produces up to an hour of playing time on the radio and generates about 3 minutes of light from the flashlight."(((bruces remarks:  I once tried to attach a canoe to a car, in the dark, using my Freeplay wind-up lantern.  This makes you realize just how much raw horsepower packs into a couple of D cells.  I can't recommend doing this, unless you enjoy frequent interruptions and need a biceps/triceps workout.)))    "The company's self-powered radios and flashlights are hits, but it keeps searching for new ways to apply its proprietary technology == even when there's no immediate demand for it. Freeplay engineers are experimenting with everything from wind-up laptops to global-positioning systems."(((And now, a few future-oriented words from Freeplay's own website:  http://www.freeplay.net   )))"Future Product Applications For Personal Power Generators"The product applications for Personal Power Generation technology and the Freeplay Personal Power Generators vary widely. The following sections review several potential applications:   "Radio Receivers:   "BayGen has successfully manufactured a range of radio receivers. A short-wave band allows the Freeplay radio to receive intercontinental signals on wind-up power.    "Commercial digital radio via satellite is being tested globally. One purpose of this technology is to allow vast areas of earth, previously unable to receive radio signals of quality, access to good radio. It is axiomatic that these same areas suffer a lack of suitable power, and an opportunity exists here for Freeplay PPG technology to provide the solution.     "BayGen has developed a successful digital weather-band and Freeplay Alert Radio (FAR), which is being market tested.     "BayGen's present radio focus is to reduce the size and cost of the Freeplay radio without compromising playtimes. The third generation  Freeplay radio (FPR3) will be at a lower price point than the current Freeplay Radios and approximately the size of VHS video cassette. This model is expected to open markets previously excluded because  of size and price. Production is scheduled for late 1998.    "Illumination:    "Freeplay Lanterns currently utilize incandescent bulbs. Future products are likely to be equipped with LED bulbs, providing improved cost, lifetimes and energy efficiency. This will allow BayGen to develop a lantern designed for everyday illumination in powerless homes and communities, including the Third World.     "Military:     "BayGen is presently involved in the development of wind-up power  packs for the following military devices: GPS (Global Positioning  Systems, which also have major civilian navigation relevance). Communications radios and a land mine detector. (((Yes, you heard right:  a wind-up landmine detector.)))     "Computers: Some  small, cheap computers in the laptop configuration (e.g. the Apple E-mate) have eliminated hard and diskette drives. Cards are used to  store and transfer data. This results in a significantly lower power  demand and allows PPG technology to enter the data processing  arena.(((Wind-up palmtops.  "I sent this piece of email with *my own muscle-power!*")))     "Computers     "BayGen has successfully powered the Apple E-mate and prototype  power packs are being field tested in Africa and the United Kingdom."(((The idea behind the "prototype power pack" seems to be to create a stand-alone wind-up energy source into which you can plug various voltage-hungy digital devices.)))     "Toys:     "Electronic developments have positioned batteries as an almost  integral part of toys. Toys are both battery hungry and price sensitive. This creates both an opportunity (the replacement of disposable  batteries with personally generated power) and a challenge (to do so inexpensively). Both directly generated power and springs are viable in the toy context and present a huge opportunity. Research and  development is underway to overcome the cost issues."O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=OMY EMAIL SPEWS  A GHASTLY PALL OF CARBON,NITROGEN AND SULFUR INTO YOUR PURE BLUE SKYO=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O
