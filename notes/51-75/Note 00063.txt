Subject: Viridian Note 00063: Real-World ProjectsKey concepts: imaginary products, ad campaigns, Viridian Curia, solar power banners, Viridian commentary, organizational problemsAttention Conservation Notice:  It's mostly about products that don't exist.  Lots of rambling.Links:  http://www.bespoke.org/viridianhttp://www.solarsolar.comEntries in the Viridian Power Banner Contest:http://www.ugrad.cs.jhu.edu/~rmharman/img/viridian/warn.fossil.gifhttp://www.subterrane.comhttp://www.netaxs.com/~morgana(note dino animation at bottom of page)http://www.phuq.com/viridianhttp://www.freeyellow.com/members6/vandewater/banner.gifhttp://humlog.homestead.com/viridianart/index.htmlhttp://www.powerbase-alpha.com/bigmike/banner.htmlThis contest expires May 31, 01999On the subject of solar banners, Cor Van de Water (deleau@freemail.nl*) remarks:"I have my own web pages, although not my own server. I also do generate my own power. The Solar system that I am powering my home with is on display on my web pages. Last 40 days I (my solar system) generated 250 kWh while I (my appliances at home) used only 200. The rest is surplus, back into the grid. Theoretically this could be used by the server that my web pages are on, resulting in a green-powered site. Although in practice I think it is just my PC, where I make my web pages, which is powered 100% green AND the neighbour's dish-washer (or something like that). Anyway, I did make a banner (actually for Linkexchange) where I feature some solar cells and the address of my page, supported by the slogan: "No time to waste PV".If you want to look at the banner:http://www.freeyellow.com/members6/vandewater/banner.gifMy solar pages are located at:http://start.at/solarKind regards,Cor van de Waterthe Netherlands"(((bruces remarks:  This is yet another fine example of the Viridian practice known as "predicting the present.")))Roger Weeks (roger@bayarea.net^^^?) offers a new idea for a Viridian Imaginary Product:"I'm working on another idea for the Imaginary Products catalog == the Viridian Home.  Not all of the ideas are conceptualized yet, but it features the following:"Rain-collection system that serves as the primary irrigation and water source."Septic tank is fitted with microbes that eat waste and output pure H2O."The house is a single-story set into a hill, with indigenous flora planted on the roof.  This keeps the house cool in summer and blends into the landscape."Wind-up washer and dryer."Power is supplied either from solar, wind, or fuel cells."Construction is from entirely recycled cellulose or other fibers."Walls are extremely thick, at least 18-24 inches, again for insulation."Skylights provide all daytime light."Nighttime lights are provided by bacteria or fungi that give off natural light.  Ideally, these would be the same microbes that eat waste.  Perhaps their other byproduct would be light."No cathode ray tubes. All displays in the model Viridian house are smart ink displays."Wireless or satellite data connections to the world net. No copper cable or telco lines in the future."We should get someone with 3D design skills to mock up a demo.  This would make a great Viridian gallery piece.   Visitors could walk marvelling through a 3D full-size house that *they can't purchase.*"Bruce Sterling remarks:   I am eager for more suggestions along this line.  We have now assembled a group of Viridian Volunteers, known as "the Viridian Curia," who want to work on Viridian imaginary ad campaigns.  Members of the Curia are the highest-ranking Viridians, and have their elite status denominated by a Viridian "bishop's crook" <?> by their log-in name.    If you would like to join the Curia and engage in the rough-and-tumble of undertaking ad projects, send me your snailmail address, and a 100-word biography indicating your areas of creative interest.  Note that there are about thirty Curia members already.  Manpower is not our problem.     Here is a summary list of Viridian Imaginary Products suggested to date.  I've not yet decided which project will be first, how to divvy up authority within the Curia, how to coordinate volunteers, what to do with the "ad" when we have it, or how to pay for any of this.  This is why Viridian life is rich and full.   Perhaps we will divide the Curia into rival design teams, depending on popular response to potential products.      Attention please, Curia members:  if you find any of these notions particularly attractive, let me know and I will make careful note of it.The Viridian EcoSystem Game (Note 00053)The Viridian Alcohol Cellphone (Note 00042)The Viridian Electrical Meter (Note 00043)The Viridian Service Station (Note 00044)The Viridian Teakettle (we have our design; this is a model-building project)The Viridian Model Home (Note 00063)The Viridian Model Family (Note 00018)The Viridian Genetically Reconstituted Mammoth-Fur SweaterViridian "Fungal Brew" Relaxant De-Stressing BeverageViridian Swag:  temporary tattoos, giveaway pencils, T-shirts, foul-weather gear, Big Mike logo'd decontamination Tyvek jumpsuits, bumper stickers, etc.0=o=0 0=o=0 0=o=0 0=o=0 0=o=0 CAUTION!
