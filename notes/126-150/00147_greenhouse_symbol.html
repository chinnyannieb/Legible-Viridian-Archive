John Weeks remarks:  "It's a little primer on Solar
Racing, which I consider  to be the Viridian sport of the
future. You'll notice it's in 14 point type, which makes
it easier for the elderly  to read."

<A HREF="http://start.at/svante">http://start.at/svante</A> Maurits Burger remarks: "In 1896, Svante Arrhenius was the
first person to predict the rise in Global Temperature as
a result of burning fossil fuels.  Since the Viridian
Movement could use some broader historical basis, I would
like to proclaim this fin de siecle, Nobel Prize winning
Swedish scientist as the First Viridian prophet, mascot,
holyman, shaman or saint. I therefore edited his picture
to supply him with the proper Viridian graphic treatment."

VIRIDIAN GREENHOUSE DISASTER SYMBOL CONTEST
<HR>
<P>
  The effects of the Greenhouse are 
        subtle and manifold. You may, for instance, find yourself drowning or 
        losing your roof. Your streets are full of gushing smoke from distant 
        forests. Dams break. Glaciers vanish. Wildlife mysteriously disappears. 
        Your ghetto has a multi-day electrical blackout as summer heat spikes 
        fill the emergency rooms. You
  might even go broke from rising insurance rates.
<P>

  There's no easy and immediate way for a 
        passer-by to connect these many disasters to their coherent source: the 
        Greenhouse Effect. Imagine that you were puking and losing your hair. A 
        handy Nuclear Radiation symbol would make causation quite clear. An 
        outbreak of cultured anthrax downwind from a BioHazard symbol would be 
        no big mystery, either. But a Greenhouse Disaster lacks a simple, striking logo.
<P>
Since the health authorities are a little remiss in
this matter, it's up to eager amateurs to make the
invisible visible.  This situation requires some very
simple stencil, a wordless survival warning like a hobo's
sign, that can be quickly chalked or sprayed onto a
typical wrecked bridge or drowned beachhouse.  This symbol
should convey the useful message that this mishap is, in
fact, no mishap.  It is part-and-parcel of an ongoing
Greenhouse crisis.
<P>

  This simple, multinational symbol 
        should be especially suited for use in the Third World, where literacy 
        rates are low, communication is spotty, infrastructure is limited and disasters are especially spectacular.
