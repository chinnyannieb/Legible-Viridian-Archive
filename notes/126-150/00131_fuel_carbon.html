Key concepts: biotech, methanol, carbon-dioxide reduction,<BR>
liver.
<P>
Attention Conservation Notice: It's a description of a
technology that doesn't quite work yet.
<P>
"Burning backwards
<P>
"Could cunning chemistry keep carbon emissions in check?"
((( "Cunning" is surely one of virtues most deeply admired
by Viridians.)))
<P>
"An enzyme that breaks down alcohol in the liver could
be used to recycle carbon, rather than pumping ever more
into the atmosphere, say chemists in Illinois.  They have
developed a more efficient way of turning the greenhouse
gas carbon dioxide into methanol using the enzyme.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "Invented by Bakul Dave and Robyn Obert of the
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Southern Illinois University in Carbondale, the process
effectively reverses the chemistry of burning.  It
promises to be a highly efficient way to produce methanol,
a clean-burning fuel that can be used to power cars.
What's more, if the energy needed to drive the process
came from sources that don't generate  CO2, this fuel
could be produced and used without adding to the
greenhouse effect.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "To make methanol, the liver enzyme and two bacterial
</BLOCKQUOTE>
enzymes are embedded in a sponge-like, glassy material,
which is placed in water.  When CO2 is bubbled through the
water, one of the bacterial enzymes, formate
dehydrogenase, converts CO2 into formic acid.  Then
another, formaldehyde dehydrogenase, transforms the formic
acid into formaldehyde.  Finally, alcohol dehydrogenase,
which normally helps our livers to detoxify alcohol,
completes the reaction by turning the formaldehyde into
methanol.
<P>
((( Now all we need is one more enzyme, and we'll all be
talking on solar-fueled boozephones.)))
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "Each of the enzyme reactions is reversible, so to
</BLOCKQUOTE>
drive the process in the right direction, the Illinois
team adds a fourth, electron-donating ingredient called
nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH).
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "The spongy glass, a substance called a silica sol-
</BLOCKQUOTE>
gel, is the key to the reaction's success.  It contains
millions of microscopic pores that act as mini-reactors.
By mixing the enzymes with the liquid gel, Dave and Obert
successfully locked them into the structure.  'When it
solidifies, the enzymes get trapped,' says Dave.  'The
enzymes can't get in or out, but the small reactants can,'
he says.  So CO2 and NADH can get in, and methanol can
diffuse out.
<P>
((( I like the idea of "spongy glass".  I wonder what it
feels like.)))
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "To make the process practical, the NADH will have to
</BLOCKQUOTE>
be recycled by constantly replenishing the electrons it
feeds to the enzymes.  Dave and Obert say this might be
possible if the sol-gel is made from materials which
conduct electricity and feed electrons back into the
system.  'The idea is that you'd feed in current
directly,' says Dave. (...)
<P>
(((This can't be much harder than making a pump-less fuel
cell the size of a postage stamp. )))
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "If Dave and Obert can solve the remaining problems,
</BLOCKQUOTE>
it might be possible to recycle the CO2 from, say, power
stations." (...)
