<P>
I hope that this morbid contest has made it entirely clear
to all concerned that the Viridian Movement will someday
die.  The Movement will cease to move. We're not at all
kidding about this.  Mortality was designed into it from
the beginning.  It is guaranteed to happen and now we even
have a special logo for it. Enjoy it while it lasts.
<P>
Circa 02000 AD, however, the movement is in high gear
and jittering all over the place.   I have just signed
with Random House to do a nonfiction book on the future of
design.  This will necessitate, among other things, a lot
of roadwork.  I've decided to share my travel schedule
with the list.  You might want to show up in some time
zone and say hi.
<P>
February 02000<BR>
Almost over, but I'm just back from Niels Diffrient's
design studio in Connecticut, where he has invented the
ultra-ergonomic "Freedom Chair" for Humanscale.

Cranbrook Academy of Art,  Bloomfield Hills, Michigan,
where I'll lecture on the  "changeable nature of
language," and then just kinda hang out on the lovely
campus, thinking deep, creative thoughts and gazing on
Elial Saarinen's gardens.  I wrote the proposal for my
novel HOLY FIRE while a guest at Cranbrook.  I have to
think that HOLY FIRE is one of my better novels.  Likely
the surroundings of its genesis had a lot to do with it.

South by SouthWest SXSW Interactive Festival.   Most every
year, we Sterlings throw an Open House to coincide with
this  Austin cyber-event.  We have even more reason to
celebrate this night of March 14, because it is my good
pal Denise Caruso's birthday, and she's in from San
Francisco.  We'll be drinking Shiner beer and Anchor Steam
and, yes, some solar-powered wines.  If you're on the
Viridian list, by all means drop by the Viridian Vatican.
Our doors will be open, you will be welcome.  A large
crowd of interesting, computer-literate hipsters will be
present.  You can bring anything you can carry, and
anybody you trust.

A jaunt to the Rhode Island School of Design with Michael
McDonough, where we plan to talk about web-powered cyber-
green architecture and cool stuff to do with bamboo.

Presidio in San Francisco: "Global Ecology and Information

tree to do this gig. I am so there!

"Building Sustainability in a Globalized World"
It's a rather long way to Hong Kong, but I'm anxious to
see Norman Foster's new airport in operation, and besides,
this global business event is sponsored by the
increasingly lively and interesting Germans.
<P>

Could be in Paris for a literary event.  Or maybe not.

"High Ground Design Conversation"  with Mike and Kathy
McCoy and a small group of their design friends.  I have
to lie flat and breathe with care at their intellectual
altitude, but the wise, all-knowing McCoys rock like mile-
high granite at the Continental Divide!  Beautiful
website, too.

It's a Texan Green fandango in the charming rural town of
Fredericksburg.  "Solar, Wind. Biomass, Geothermal, Hydro,
Green Building; Sustainable/Organic Gardening &amp; Farming,
Education/Products/Services."  That sounds like us all
right. I'm thinking maybe a Viridian table presentation
and a public outreach effort.  I'm looking for local
Viridian volunteers who might want to truck out to
Fredericksburg with me and press the flesh.  Weird toys
and spark-spitting gizmos a definite bonus.

Doors of Perception 6: Lightness
I am increasingly likely to attend this European event.
First, because time spent with John Thackara is never
wasted, and second, because it's Amsterdam. Amsterdam is
one of the few truly civilized cities on Earth, and we
Viridians should all  make a point of visiting Amsterdam
before rising seas drown The Netherlands.

"Mathematically Literate New Millennium Party"
After surviving 02000, a big New Years' Eve Party at my
house for all of us who understand the difficult matter of
actually counting from the year zero.  Mark your calendars
now.
