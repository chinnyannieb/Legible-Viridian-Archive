"General Motors breaks with global warming skeptics
<P>
"By DAVID GOODMAN
<P>
"DETROIT (March 15, 2000 8:23 a.m. EST
<A HREF="http://www.nandotimes.com">http://www.nandotimes.com</A>) == Environmentalists are
claiming victory following General Motors' decision to
quit a lobbying group that has opposed a 1997 global
warming treaty reached in Kyoto, Japan. Ford Motor Co. and
DaimlerChrysler Corp. withdrew earlier.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "GM notified the Washington-based Global Climate
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Coalition on Monday that it was ending its membership, GM
spokesman Bill Noack said Tuesday.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "'GM's withdrawal (...) makes me hopeful that
</BLOCKQUOTE>
opposition to real solutions is in permanent decline,'
said John Passacantando, executive director of Ozone
Action.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "'As the impacts of global warming worsen, it will
</BLOCKQUOTE>
take increasing moral maturity on the part of our
corporations and country to rise to the occasion,' said
Sister Patricia Daly of the Interfaith Center on Corporate
Responsibility. 'General Motors' departure from the global
warming skeptics is a step towards achieving this
maturity.'
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "GM remains opposed to the Kyoto agreement but
</BLOCKQUOTE>
acknowledges that carbon dioxide buildup in the atmosphere
could be changing the world's climate.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "The withdrawal 'really doesn't reflect any change
</BLOCKQUOTE>
in our position,' Noack said from Washington. 'We continue
to oppose the Kyoto Protocol.'   (((In other words, GM is
quitting the GCC, not because of any basic political
disagreement, but strictly because the GCC stinks so
badly.  Even GM can't bear to remain on the public
podium with such notorious liars.)))
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "After the GM announcement, coalition Executive
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Director Glenn Kelly said the group was restructuring and
individual companies no longer could join. Instead, he
said membership would consist only of trade associations."
(...)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  (((It's the old "you can't fire me, I quit" gambit.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
The GCC doesn't even mention the defection of GM in their
most recent website press release, preferring to spin
their ongoing debacle as an intentional
"restructuring.")))

"Move will focus debate on the real issues
"GCC announces 2nd phase of strategic restructuring
<P>
"WASHINGTON, March 14, 2000 == The Global Climate
Coalition today announced the implementation of the second
stage of an ongoing strategic restructuring designed to
streamline coalition operations and bring the focus of the
climate debate back to the real issues.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "GCC Executive Director Glenn Kelly said that only
</BLOCKQUOTE>
trade associations will be eligible for membership in the
coalition, effective immediately.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  (((It would be very interesting to see press reaction
</BLOCKQUOTE>
from the folks at  Allegheny Power, American Commercial
Barge Line Co., Atlantic Richfield Coal Company,  Baker
Refineries, Bethlehem Steel, BHP Minerals, Chevron,
Cinergy, CONRAIL, CSX Transportation, Inc., Cyprus-Amax,
Drummond Company, Duke Power Company, Eastman Chemical,
ExxonMobil, Goodyear Tire &amp; Rubber Co., Greencool, Hoechst
Celanese Chemical Group, Illinois Power Company, Kaiser
Aluminum and Chemical Corp., McDonnell-Douglas, Norfolk
Southern, Northern Indiana Public Serv. Co., Ohio Edison.
Parker Drilling Company, TECO Energy Inc., USX
Corporation, Union Carbide, and Union Pacific.  Unless I
misunderstand this GCC press release, all of these many
corporations have just been unilaterally purged from the
ranks of the GCC by Director Kelly.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  (((Do they know this yet?  Did they, in fact, even
</BLOCKQUOTE>
know that they belonged to the GCC in the first place?  It
would certainly make a nice Viridian Individual Project
for some Viridian to call the public relations offices of
all these corporations.  Ask them if they know that they
have just been fired from the Global Climate Coalition.
We Viridians would be extremely interested in knowing
their response.)))
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "Today's announcement comes on the heels of a news
</BLOCKQUOTE>
conference held last week where the GCC unveiled its '21st
Century Climate Action Agenda.' Kelly said that these
strategic moves are part of a long-term initiative to
refocus the public debate on climate policy to the issues
at hand == namely, a policy contest between the unworkable
Kyoto Protocol versus a more pragmatic and viable solution
to the climate issue that relies on technology, innovation
and American ingenuity.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  (((Shouldn't that be "global" ingenuity?)))
  <P>
  "The GCC will continue to remain the leading voice for
</BLOCKQUOTE>
U.S. businesses in the climate debate. With this
restructuring, the coalition now represents nearly every
sector of the U.S. economy, including agriculture,
forestry, mining, oil and gas, chemicals, manufacturing,
electricity generation, steel, transportation, cement, and
small businesses." (((Just look at that amazing, bold lie!
It's as if the GCC had suddenly <strong>gained</strong> representation in
industry that they didn't already have, when in point of
fact  they've cut their losses by jettisoning half their
membership.)))
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "Although only trade associations are eligible for
</BLOCKQUOTE>
membership, the coalition will continue to welcome support
from other like-minded organizations."  (((Better get
those resume's in order; even the GCC's own personnel will
have to leave it soon.  Luckily for them, the Greenhouse
denial industry is every bit as flourishing as creation-
science; there's still plenty of room over at Heartland
Institute, Greening Earth Society, Western Fuels Org, etc
etc.)))
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "'For too long, some have tried to make the GCC the
</BLOCKQUOTE>
issue as an excuse for avoiding the hard question == is
your solution to the  climate question the Kyoto Protocol,
or not,' Kelly asked.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  (((We Viridians aren't among those "some."  For the
</BLOCKQUOTE>
record, we know that Kyoto is a joke.  However, you in the
GCC have no "excuse."  You are enemies of the human race
who have sold out our childrens' future for a lousy sixty
million dollars a year.  You reptiles should be answering
"hard questions" in the dock as environmental war
criminals, facing an impartial jury of Mozambican flood
victims.)))

"General Motors Withdraws from Global Climate Coalition
<P>
"March 14, 2000.  Today, General Motors announced its
withdrawal from the Global Climate Coalition (GCC), the
industry trade group best known for public relations
campaigns designed to make the public doubt the reality of
global warming.J
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "This comes after a convergence of  pressure on the
</BLOCKQUOTE>
company from several student campaigns and the religious
community: student groups from thirty five universities
have called on their administrations to divest from GCC
member companies; dozens of additional campuses have
deployed a jobs boycott against GM; and religious
shareholders have used the power of their retirement funds
to persuade the company to stop its involvement in the
misinformation on global warming.
<P>

  "GMUs withdrawal follows that of BP-Amoco, Shell
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Oil, and in the last four months, Ford Motor, Daimler-
Chrysler, Texaco, and one of the nationUs largest energy
companies, The Southern Company.J On Ford MotorUs
departure, its spokesperson noted that 'Over time
membership in the GCC has become an impediment to credibly
achieving our environmental goals.' The departure of
General Motors, the GCCUs largest corporate member, leaves
the coalition without any auto-manufacturers. (...)
