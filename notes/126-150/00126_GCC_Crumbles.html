Richard Puchalsky remarks:  "I previously sent in the URL
for my calculator that figures out the CO2 generated from
a person's residential electricity.  It became a Yahoo
Site of the Day, even though I never told anyone about it
except the Viridian list.   Now I've  written a new
calculator to estimate CO2 emissions from cars.  It also
shows you how much money you'd save and how much less CO2
you'd release if you switched to a car with better gas
mileage."

  The Global Climate Coalition is in trouble.  They've
</BLOCKQUOTE>
recently suffered a spate of prominent defections,  among
them Ford, General Motors, BP-Amoco, Shell and Dow
Chemical.  Not because the GCC lacks effectiveness, mind
you.  Mostly it's because, after 11 years, the GCC stinks
so badly that it has become a public-relations burden.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  The GCC's new rival is the Pew Center on Global
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Climate Change, which looks and acts very much like the
GCC, but isn't soiled with a legacy of logjamming,
defamation and dirty tricks.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  I'd predict that this GCC facade will shut down
</BLOCKQUOTE>
soon.  A sanitizing name-change will take place.  The
individuals behind the GCC will resume their lobbying
labors under another guise.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  One may note that the GCC website, while still up to
</BLOCKQUOTE>
date,  is looking rather stodgy and listless these days.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  One of the most remarkable things about the GCC's
</BLOCKQUOTE>
website is how amazingly thin and perfunctory their
scientific evidence is. You'd think that after 11 years,
they could have piled up vast formidable archives of
Greenhouse-denial folderol, or at least settled on some
coherent  intellectual stance on the issue.  But no:
<P>
Link:  <A HREF="http://www.globalclimate.org/ScienceSub1.htm">http://www.globalclimate.org/ScienceSub1.htm</A><BR>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  There is no global warming; there is global warming,
</BLOCKQUOTE>
but it's all-natural; there's no such thing as a stable
climate to begin with; weather troubles are all media
hype;  there's nothing new about weird weather; it's very
much hotter, but that's just a passing phase.
<P>
In other words, they're all over the map.   That's
because the GCC are spin-doctors rather than policy wonks.
Their long-established habit is to reflexively spew soot
at anything that looks like greenhouse enlightenment.
Being lazy, they don't engage in the mental gymnastics
that Greenhouse pseudo-science requires.   They've
shrugged off those  labors onto their fellow-travellers in
Greening Earth Society, the Marshall Institute, and Fred
Singer's wacky SEPP, an organization so tiny and off-the-
wall that it's basically the same size and shape as the
Viridian Movement.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  So the GCC's glory days are fading.  They were
</BLOCKQUOTE>
criminally wrong to begin with, and it's now become a case
of ducking the consequences.  Ford's gone already, and the
Ford defection was clearly unnerving.  DaimlerChrysler was
the most recent to jump ship, as seen in a recent
Vancouver Sun article.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "'We are now at a stage in the climate change debate
</BLOCKQUOTE>
where we prefer to either speak for ourselves on this
issue or pursue a dialogue on the subject through broader-
based business organizations,' Jim Holden, president of
DaimlerChrysler AG's Chrysler division, said in a letter
to the coalition." (...)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "'With new scientific evidence of global warming
</BLOCKQUOTE>
emerging daily, it excellent news that the Global Climate
Coalition is losing its most prominent members,' said Dan
Becker of the Sierra Club."
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Neither Ford nor DaimlerChrysler are pro-Kyoto
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Accords.  They're simply anti-GCC.  They're warily
distancing themselves from the hell to come.  However, the
GCC still has plenty of corporate and business-NGO muscle
behind it.  The most recent GCC roll-call I can find looks
like this:

  </BLOCKQUOTE>
  This is not to say that all these companies and
</BLOCKQUOTE>
organizations really care about their Beltway lackeys in
the GCC.   Most of them signed up many years ago, and
probably can't be bothered to do much now but sign the
checks.  The operational slack is therefore taken up by
committed zealouts like the American Petroleum Institute
and, especially,  the Western Fuels Association, the
crazily radical patrons of the Greening Earth Society.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  What does this mean for the world?  Well, if you're
</BLOCKQUOTE>
in Paris right now, wondering who should hang from a
lamppost because you're lost a quarter of your city's
lovely trees ==  well, look up there at that phalanx of
fatcats.   See them?  See how many there are, and how
large they are, and how rich, and how entirely American?
They are the biggest smut-spewing industries in the
biggest smut-spewing country on Earth.  J'accuse!
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  It's rather unconscionable, but if you hadn't lost
</BLOCKQUOTE>
your trees and roofs in the City of Light, they would have
lost their livelihoods.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  The GCC's arguments seem ditzy and perfunctory for a
</BLOCKQUOTE>
simple reason.  The GCC doesn't require good arguments.
Open scientific debate was never their objective.  Even
the GCC itself turned out to be a mere smokescreen.  When
push came to shove,  the carbon industries defeated the
Kyoto Accords by simply buying the United States Senate
wholesale.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  With this operational chock firmly in place, the
</BLOCKQUOTE>
GCC are free to fill the airwaves with transparent
absurdity.   Let them defame scientists, spread
disinformation, spew alarmism about the purported fate of
the children and elderly; the GCC came into existence in
order to stop Kyoto, and there, the news is very good.  No
amount of public rage is going to rip the Kyoto logjam
loose in the US  Senate.  The US Senate <strong>enjoys</strong> its power
to indefinitely stymie international accords.  It's absurd
for the Senate to bow to the pipsqueaks of Kyoto when they
play dice with nuclear arms accords.  US Senators are
being highly-paid by the carbon industries to preserve the
Senate's own imperial power over the fate of the globe.
It's bliss for all concerned.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  There is, however, one problem with this lovely
</BLOCKQUOTE>
political hack-job.  The problem is  time.  Roasting the
buying population wholesale is not very consumer-friendly.
Coal-stained troglodytes like Cyprus-Amax and the Western
Fuels Association wouldn't know a consumer if they saw
one.  But Ford and Daimler do need to be more fastidious.
So they've tiptoed away.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Eventually, everyone in that long list of GCC
</BLOCKQUOTE>
sponsors will discover that their own homes, their own
cities, their own children have begun to suffer in the
Greenhouse heat.  My prediction then:  frantic lobbying
for a carbon amnesty, carried out by the same malefactors,
under a different name.
