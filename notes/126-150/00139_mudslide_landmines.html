      <p>(((A particularly colorful aspect of the Mozambique disaster are the 
        migrating land mines. This phenomenon was also known in Honduras after 
        their obliterating hurricane. Land mines are especially dramatic and newsworthy, 
        in that their declared design intention is to blow people´s legs off. 
      </p>
      <p>(((However, truly massive floods, by violently scrambling the infrastructure, 
        leave all kinds of impromptu death traps. Homes float off their foundations 
        and their natural gas pipes catch fire; underground gasoline tanks erupt 
        from the soggy topsoil; bridges and dams are fatally weakened to collapse 
        years later; the spectrum of "Wexelblat disaster" is as variant as industrialism 
        itself. See the related Viridian concepts of "Involuntary Parks," where 
        nature returns because mankind has rendered the area humanly uninhabitable, 
        and "The World is Uninsurable": when massive disaster is so frequent that 
        entire nations become too risky to attract investment capital.))) </p>

      <p>"Land mines complicate Mozambique rescue" </p>
      <p>"Maputo, Mozambique == Hundreds of US soldiers expected to join rescue 
        efforts in Mozambique as early as this weekend will have deadly obstacles 
        other than the weather to overcome, according to land mine experts in 
        this devastated southern African country. </p>
      <p>"Mozambique is one of the most heavily mined places on Earth, the legacy 
        of a lengthy civil war in the 1980s and early 1990s. The rain and floods 
        of the past month have submerged thousands of the deadly devices in the 
        worst-hit Gaza province, where the Limpopo and Save rivers have spilled 
        across vast stretches of land. </p>
      <p>"Moreover, hundreds of the buried weapons are believed to have been swept 
        from positions that humanitarian groups had painstakingly plotted on maps 
        during the past few years. Portions of the flood plain considered safe 
        only a month ago are once again potential death traps. </p>
      <p>"´It is really dangerous right now because our maps are not accurate 
        anymore,´ said Nicolas Blais, mine coordinator for Handicap International, 
        one of half a dozen organizations that clear mines in Mozambique. ´People 
        don´t have a chance to see what is under their feet because of the water.´ 
        (...) (((It´s always grimly cheering to see these selfless Non-Governmental 
        Organizations pitching in; in Mozambique´s case, they´re probably best-described 
        as "Post-Governmental Organizations." Land mines have attracted a lot 
        of activism. Soon, we´re likely to see rescue NGOs sprouting up worldwide 
        specifically for Greenhouse disaster relief.))) </p>
      <p>"Varying estimates put the number of land mines in the country, which 
        is slightly bigger than Texas, between 400,000 and 2 million. (...) (((It´s 
        a nice measure of the scope of uncertainty that 1,600,000 anti-personnel 
        devices are entirely undocumented. Why don´t landmine exporters make landmines 
        that will rot? "Embrace decay," fellas == even with your best efforts, 
        no war lasts forever.))) </p>
      <p>"The United Nations estimates that up to 1 million people have lost their 
        homes and are in urgent need of help after the worst floods in decades 
        to strike the poverty-stricken country. Thousands more are feared dead."
