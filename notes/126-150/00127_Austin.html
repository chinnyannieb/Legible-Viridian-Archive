(((The Global Climate Coalition is stumbling, Ford has
a new electric go-kart division, whale-meat poisons anyone
who dares to eat a whale, and my home town has the
cheapest GreenChoice energy program in the nation!
Year 02000, je t'aime!  Life is good, isn't it?
I am really enjoying this!  Watch me sign up for this new
program and crow to an extent that's scarcely bearable!)))

"Electricity consumers get choice of 'greener' energy
<P>
by Dick Stanley, American-Statesman staff
<P>
"Austin electricity customers willing to pay a little more
for a long-lasting contribution to a clean environment
will ge the chance in GreenChoice, a new program of Austin
Energy, the city-owned electric utility.
<P>
"Utility officials announced Tuesday they will buy 40
megawatts of electricity generated from renewable energy
sources, such as West Texas wind turbines and methane gas
collected from sanitary landfills in Austin and elsewhere.
Consumers who want to support the effort can sign up for
GreenChoice's higher electric rates.
<P>
"Austin Energy will commit as much as 1 percent of its
$780 million annual budget for each of the next 10 years
== at least $6.8 million in year one, or a maximum of $7.8
million if no customers sign up.
<P>
"The utility has signed contracts with two local
companies and one from Houston to build wind turbine
generators and methane extractors, set to go on line by
the fall.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "Customers who wish to participate will pay, based
</BLOCKQUOTE>
on an average bill of $70 a month, about an extra 12 cents
a day == or $4 a month == on their average monthly
electrical bills.  Austin Energy officials say the fee is
the lowest in the country for a Green Choice program.
<P>
"'We're asking everyone in the community to join us,'
Mayor Kirk Watson said.  'This will put us on the cutting
edge of doing what's right.'
<P>
"Officials said the utility needs about 20,000
residential subscribers to make the program work.  That
level of participation would generate about $1 million a
year of the $7.8 million committed to the three companies.
<P>
"If enough customers sign up to exceed the 40
megawatts of supply, Austin Energy spokesman Ed Clark said
the utility would contract for more wind generators or
methane facilities.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "GreenChoice has the potential to 'make Austin the
</BLOCKQUOTE>
standard-bearer in the country for renewable energy,' said
Mark Kapner, manager of Austin Energy's renewable energy
and conservation program.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "Officials said GreenChoice also will help reduce
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Austin's ozone air pollution problem, which is expected to
draw stringent Environmental Protection Agency
restrictions on drivers and businesses by July.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "'We hope everyone in Austin signs up,' City Council
</BLOCKQUOTE>
member Gus Garcia said, 'so our children and grandchildren
can have clean air.'
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "A brochure and applications for the GreenChoice
</BLOCKQUOTE>
renewable electricity program are available by calling
Austin Energy at 512-499-7827.  They can also be picked up
at any Austin Public Library location.  Or see
