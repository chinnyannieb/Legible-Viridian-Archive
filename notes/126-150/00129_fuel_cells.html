<P>
"Motorola Makes Fuel Cell to Power Laptops, Phones
<P>
"SCHAUMBURG, Ill. (Reuters) == Motorola Inc. (NYSE:MOT)
said on Wednesday that researchers developed a powerful,
miniature fuel cell that may one day replace traditional
batteries in laptop computers, cellular phones and other
devices."
<P>
(((I like the way they cut right to the chase and give out
the name of the stock in the first three words.)))
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "Motorola, the world's No. 2 wireless phone maker and
</BLOCKQUOTE>
a major computer chip manufacturer, said scientists at its
labs and at Los Alamos National Laboratory used liquid
methanol to power the cells, which last up to 10 times
longer than existing rechargeable batteries. Liquid
methanol, a wood alcohol, is also used in windshield wiper
fluid.
<P>
(((Amazingly, at lanl.gov, taxpayer-supported federal
researchers get first billing instead of Motorola.  LANL
doesn't, however, list itself as "World's No. 2 Nuclear
Warhead Maker."  The Viridian Imaginary Product dream of a
booze-powered cellphone is one step closer to reality,
except that == come on, guys == you cannot drink
windshield wiper fluid.  Get with the program.)))
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "The fuel cells, which are still about three to five
</BLOCKQUOTE>
years away from the store shelves, could power a wireless
phone for more than a month and keep a laptop running for
20 hours, Bill Ooms, director of Motorola's material,
device, and energy research, said in a telephone
interview."
<P>
(((This Bill Ooms guy has got something on the ball!
Check out his lovely home!  Vaulted ceilings, wood-powered
stove, heated floors... Of course, this tasteful structure
may belong to some <strong>other</strong> Motorola engineer named "Bill
Ooms," but what are the odds.)))

  "They would use small plastic canisters similar to
</BLOCKQUOTE>
those used for fountain pen ink. Consumers could easily
check the methanol level to find out when to replace the
fuel cell, which will likely cost as much as or less than
traditional rechargeables, Ooms said."
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  (((Call me a market-burned cynic, but did you ever
</BLOCKQUOTE>
notice that Lamy, Rotring, Waterman and Waterford fountain
pens sell tiny, overpriced driblets of ink that <b>don't
interoperate</b>?  Look for similar segmentation and lock-in
in the corporate fuel-cell market!  Ink and alcohol are so
dead cheap that the revenue stream is all in uniquely
shaped plastic canisters.)))
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "'Manufacturers are constantly developing new
</BLOCKQUOTE>
features for portable electronic equipment that require
more power and longer operating life,' Ooms said. 'These
fuel cells have an amazing ability to produce energy for
longer periods of time while weighing far less than
conventional batteries.'"
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  (((I find myself severely un-amazed that you can pump
</BLOCKQUOTE>
fuel into a little motor and it will run for a long time.
But, sense-of-wonder aside, I'd pay good money to see my
arsenal of gizmos stop excreting dead, toxic batteries.)))
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "(...) These new miniature cells, each measuring about
</BLOCKQUOTE>
one inch square and less than one-tenth of an inch in
thickness, use a reservoir of inexpensive methanol that,
when combined with the oxygen in the air, produces
electricity."
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  (((The darn things are the size of postage stamps!
</BLOCKQUOTE>
"Pervasive computing," here we come.)))
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "The 'air breathing' fuel cell was developed at Los
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Alamos National Laboratory. The highly simplified and
miniaturized design eliminates the need for air pumps,
heat exchangers and other complex devices that previous
fuel cells required and therefore disqualified them from
successful use in small portable electronic products."
<P>
(((Lest one imagine that this is mere pipe-dream hooey,
check out this extensive list of heavy-duty industry
operators.  Every last one of these outfits is ready to
start signing checks for "Commercialization of Small Fuel
Cells and Battery Technologies For Use in Portable
Applications".)))
