<P>
Key concepts:  websites, web surfing, greenhouse denial<BR>
industry, lobbyists, anti-environmental movement
<P>
Attention Conservation Notice:  Incredibly time-consuming.
Also a revolting spectacle. Might prove useful for
conspiracy trials when the International Courts of Justice
in The Hague are stacking sandbags around the courthouse.
<P>
Entries in the Greenhouse Disaster Symbol contest:
One entry, but we haven't stuck it on a website yet.
This contest expires May 31, 2000.
<P>
Links: Check out the nifty cybergreen leaf-and-circuitry<BR>
graphic for these Swiss NGO wonks:

It's net.war for those lying wretches at ExxonMobil:

Anti-Greens on the Web
<HR>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.capitalresearch.org/">http://www.capitalresearch.org/</A>
Free-market watchdog organization that specializes in
combating foundation-funded green liberals.  AKA:
<A HREF="http://www.Green-Watch.com/">http://www.Green-Watch.com/</A><BR>
See all your favorite environmental groups revealed as
tools of the Ford and Rockefeller Foundations.  Unless
they're Earth First!, in which case they're terrorists.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.alec.org">http://www.alec.org</A><BR>
American Legislative Exchange Council
Wide-ranging crank-wonk "forum for legislators" that
loathes Kyoto, urban zoning, coddling criminals, "federal
tobacco grab," etc.
<P>
Cascade Policy Institute<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.cascadepolicy.org">http://www.cascadepolicy.org</A><BR>
"Oregon's Free Market Think Tank" hates Oregon's zoning,
urban growth restrictions, "Potemkin transport" light rail
initiatives.
<P>
Cato Institute<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.cato.org">http://www.cato.org</A><BR>
Publishes "Regulation" magazine and various books
"proving" that environmental problems are exacerbated by
the federal government. Great line of e-commerce mousepads
and coffeemugs.
<P>
Center for the Study of American Business
<A HREF="http://csab.wustl.edu">http://csab.wustl.edu</A><BR>
"Improves public understanding of the private enterprise
system" by attacking public regulation with right-wing
academic pamphlets.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.cei.org">http://www.cei.org</A><BR>
Competitive Enterprise Institute
Home hangout of Myron Ebell, denial-industry editor of the
"Cooler Heads Newsletter" and capo of "Cooler Heads
Coalition," a cluster of denial fellow-travellers.  CEI
also sponsors Mark Mills, author of "The Internet Begins
with Coal,"  a favorite of Greening Earth Society and
Forbes magazine.
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.vehiclechoice.org">http://www.vehiclechoice.org</A><BR>
Sport-Ute freaks wary of emissions and Kyoto restrictions.
Lots of rich friends in the car industry.

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.consumeralert.org">http://www.consumeralert.org</A><BR>
Beltway bandits who do for "consumerism" what "Greening
Earth Society" does for Greens.  Industry weasels in
stolen consumer's clothing.
<P>
Citizens for a Sound Economy<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.cse.org">http://www.cse.org</A><BR>
Lobbyists.  Not much about "sound economics," but plenty
about standard right-wing US issues like tort reform,
school choice, Internet taxation, and EPA interference
with profits.  Also dabbles in climate denial:
<A HREF="http://www.cse.org/informed/473.html">http://www.cse.org/informed/473.html</A>
<P>
Environment Probe<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.nextcity.com/environmentprobe/index.html">http://www.nextcity.com/environmentprobe/index.html</A>
Wacky Canadians who advocate environmental improvement via
privatizing everything, including water, beaches, forests,
and fisheries.
<P>
Fraser Institute<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.fraserinstitute.ca">http://www.fraserinstitute.ca</A><BR>
Canadian free-market zealots.  Extensive line in climate
denial.<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.fraserinstitute.ca/publications/books/g_warming/decline.html">http://www.fraserinstitute.ca/publications/books/g_warming/decline.html</A>
<P>
George C. Marshall Institute<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.marshall.org">http://www.marshall.org</A><BR>
Headed by "scientists of international renown," it's a
nonprofit hangout for pedigreed denial-science cranks,
including Sallie Baliunas, Bruce Ames, Frederick Seitz,
Chauncey Starr, etc.  Interesting odd tie-ins with NASA
rocket geezers == why, for instance, does something called
the "George C. Marshall Institute" publish strident calls
to colonize Mars?
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.pacificresearch.org/issues/enviro/enviro.html">http://www.pacificresearch.org/issues/enviro/enviro.html</A>
California-based "free-market environmentalism" with
strident assertions that global warming doesn't exist,
while the US environment is getting better and better.
Also features "Center for Freedom and Technology" for a
Milton Friedmanized version of the Internet.
<P>
The Heartland Institute<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.heartland.org">http://www.heartland.org</A><BR>
Chicago-based policy wonks publish virulently anti-Green
"Environmental &amp; Climate News" and its aptly named sister
publication, "Intellectual Ammunition."  Their extensive
list of anti-green fellow-traveller links is even scarier
than the present list:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.heartland.org/gateway.htm">http://www.heartland.org/gateway.htm</A>
<P>
<A HREF="http://www.alternet.org/PublicArchive/Berkowitz041400.html">http://www.alternet.org/PublicArchive/Berkowitz041400.html</A>
A swell Green tell-all article on Heartland.org and its
net-based "PolicyBot." "Right-wing think tanks and
industry associations are the major players behind the
movement opposing environmental regulation and attacking
environmentalists."
<P>
Science and Environmental Policy Project
<A HREF="http://www.sepp.org/">http://www.sepp.org/</A><BR>
The trick to understanding this site is to realize that
everyone in the world is scientifically illiterate, except
for S. Fred Singer and six or seven of his friends.  By
the way, Fred's extremely eager to rocket off to Mars:

No Anti-Viridian list could pass without a special place
for our bete noire, "Greening Earth Society!"

Like a compass that always points south, Greening Earth
swiftly and infallibly embraces the most damaging public
positions possible!  Even when they are damaging to
Greening Earth itself, as in this recent net.alert from
GES capo Chris Paynter:<BR>
"POWER PLANTS PUMPING OUT TWO BILLION TONS OF POLLUTANTS"
