"Fredrick Palmer, in addition to being President of the
Greening Earth Society, is General Manager and Chief
Executive Officer of Western Fuels Association Inc., a
not-for-profit fuel supply cooperative comprised of
consumer-owned electric utilities."  (((In other words,
he's a coal miner and a lobbyist.)))
<P>
"Climate Comments: Earth Day 2000
<P>
by Fredrick D. Palmer
<P>
"Go online." (((We live to serve!))) "Take a look at
<A HREF="http://www.earthday.net">http://www.earthday.net</A>.  It's the home page for Earth Day
Network.  On Earth Day, April 22, 2000 (my birthday),
there will be a huge celebration sponsored by Earth Day
Network on the Mall in Washington DC.  My wife and I will
attend, but I'll be wearing a baseball cap and
sunglasses."
<P>
(((Pity Fred didn't sneak into the Seattle anti-WTO demo
in that outfit == he'd have been summarily
peppergassed.)))
<P>
<P>
"The home page tells you the game.
<P>
<P>
"'It's been a blast, fossil fuels, but now we're into
payback time.  Carbon pollution, great gobs of it from the
U.S., is giving Mother Earth a fever.  Weird weather is
just the warm-up act.'"
<P>
<P>
"The environmental community wants each of us to quit
using fossil fuels and switch entirely to renewables.
<P>
<P>
"Are you surprised?  Are you shocked?  If you are,
you haven't been paying attention."  (((I've been paying
rather a lot of attention, and I'm shocked to see Fredrick
Palmer, of all people, finally panicking.  With Ford,
Shell, and GM gone, the last rat off the sinking ship gets
indicted.)))  "President Clinton, after all, calls the
Kyoto Protocol 'a good first step.'  Obviously, he means a
first step to a fossil-fuel free future.
<P>
<P>
"It's been clear for years that the goal of modern-
day environmentalism is the elimination of fossil fuel as
an energy source.  Those of us in the energy business know
how nonsensical this goal is."  (((Except for those of us
in the renewable energy business, presumably.)))  "Those
of us in the energy business know that the American
economy succeeds because of fossil fuels, not in spite of
them."  (((Yeah, but what if America <strong>does</strong> succeed "in
spite of them?"  Interesting of him to raise that
possibility, even rhetorically.)))  "Those of us in the
energy business know that societies that are fossil fuel
intensive are the most successful, and that people in
those societies have greater health and greater wealth
than societies that are less fossil fuel intensive."
(((Think of the bountiful coal in booming Appalachia, for
instance.)))
<P>
<P>
"It's also clear that the environmental community
(((Why is there no "energy community," one idly wonders)))
has the attention of the popular media (((as opposed to
the ever-whirring propaganda mill of Greening Earth
Society))) and substantial backing not just from
politicians, but also from the federal government
generally, academia, and state governments as well.  This
support extends even into state capitals, where their
economic heath depends on a robust fossil fuel industry."
(((Yo! Hey! Down here!  In the oil belt!   Austin, Texas!
<A HREF="http://www.austinenergy.com/greenchoice">http://www.austinenergy.com/greenchoice</A>  )))
<P>
<P>
"Why is this?  There's a simple answer and it's one
word: ourselves.
<P>
<P>
"Industry in the United States seems incapable of
standing up for itself.  Industry in the United States
seems incapable of telling the American people == with a
consistent voice == that it's OK to be human and OK for
humans to engage in industrial activity; that industrial
activity is good and not bad; that we live longer and
better because of it; that more people on Earth living
better ought to be our goal; and that government policies
designed to the contrary are bad ideas."  (((Go tell your
backers that lots of <b>Communist Chinese</b> industrial
activity is "good and not bad," and see how far that gets
you.)))
<P>
<P>
"(...)  We have been at our advocacy work for ten
years.  I have delivered with mixed success this message
in one form or another to literally scores of executives
in the coal, electric utility, oil, and natural gas
industries.  There are times when I feel like I'm talking
to a wall."  (((Give it a few more years of ocean warming,
and you can talk to a seawall.)))
<P>
<P>
(...) "Let me say again here as clearly as I can == on
the record before an audience much broader than industry
executives == if industry does not get off its collective
duff and take the environmental community head-on,
including putting forward a well thought-out,
sophisticated case as to why Earth Day Network and those
in alliance with them are simply wrong, we will all lose
our collective enterprises over the long term.
<P>
<P>
"The view from here is that Vice President Al Gore
will be the next President of the United States.  Under a
Gore Presidency, the efforts of the last eight years to
de-carbonize the American economy will intensify.  But I
also submit that those efforts will go on even if there is
a Republican in the White House.  After all, it was
President George Bush who signed the Rio Treaty and put
all of this into play.
<P>
<P>
"You may think a de-carbonized American economy sounds
like a good idea."  (((Why, yes!)))  "I don't, and not
just because I'm in the fossil fuel business."  (((So
you'd be pumping millions of tons of carbon into the
atmosphere even if it didn't make you any money, then; as
a kind of public-spirited hobby, apparently.)))  "I am
convinced that if you agree with me and thing de-
carbonizing the U.S. economy is a bad idea, then it is
time for you to engage.  If you don't, I submit the
American economy ultimately will de-carbonize, no matter
who is the next President of the United States."
<P>
(((A specter is haunting the coal fields: a "de-
carbonized" America! And all that's required is for Fred
and his friends to do nothing!  What would that American
economy look like? Something like today's British economy,
presumably.  Britain is relatively untroubled by Fredrick
D. Palmer and his ilk, so Britain is meeting its own Kyoto
Accords with a near-total absence of effort.)))

"UK's DTI says 1999 CO2 emissions down 7.5% on 1990 levels
<P>
By Bridge News
<P>
"London == Mar 30, 2000 == Carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions
in the UK for 1999 were down 7.5% compared with levels in
1990, according to provisional estimates published
Thursday by the UK's Department of Trade and Industry
(DTI). Energy minister Helen Liddell said the figures
showed the UK was 'well on course to meet (its) target to
keep emissions of CO2 and other greenhouse gases below
1990 levels by 2000.'
<P>
<P>
"Liddell pointed out that 1999's 7.5% decrease against
1990 levels was set against 20% growth in the UK economy
over the same period.
<P>
<P>
"'We have made considerable progress in uncoupling
energy consumption from economic growth," she said. (...)
<P>
<P>
"Lidell added that the forthcoming Utilities Bill
'places an obligation on electricity suppliers to purchase
10% of their electricity from renewable sources by 2010."
