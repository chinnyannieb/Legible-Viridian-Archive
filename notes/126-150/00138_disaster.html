The March-April 2000 issue of "Artbyte: The Magazine of

Fortune magazine, Special 70th Anniversary Issue
March 6, 2000: "The Amazing Future of Business"
Bruce Sterling's somewhat jaundiced version of Fortune's
"amazing future of business" involves a report from the
year 2035 in which "we're having an El Nino from hell.
South Dakota, Kansas, Nebraska, Oklahoma and large chunks
of Texas are all dry, cracked, dusty and commonly on
fire."
<P>
(((Meanwhile, in an area of the world where FORTUNE and
ARTBYTE don't have many subscribers, those who managed to
survive a civil war are facing floods, cholera, dysentery,
and starvation.)))

"MAPUTO, Mozambique (CNN) == Thousands of people were
stranded atop cars, roofs and  trees in Mozambique on
Monday as rain-fed rivers rose ever higher, engulfing
whole villages while rescuers worked frantically to save
everyone they could.
<P>
"More than 2,000 people were rescued by Monday by five
South African defense force helicopters == but a World
Food Program (WFP) coordinator said than more than 100,000
were still stranded in the region, many without food or
water for up to four days.  (...)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "The already-strained helicopters flew back and forth
</BLOCKQUOTE>
ferrying stranded villagers to safety, often  dangerously
overloaded. One pilot said he just closes his eyes, hits
the power and hopes they lift off. (...)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "For those who have been rescued, the situation is
</BLOCKQUOTE>
only marginally less dire. Little food, water  and shelter
is available. (...)

  "More than half a million have lost their homes in

Mozambique, South Africa, Zimbabwe and Botswana during
three weeks of torrential rains."

    "It should be noted that in Maputo/Mavalane,
  </BLOCKQUOTE>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
rainfall reached 328mm less than 24 hours on 6th February.
According to international measurements, rainfall in the
region of 100mm in 24 hours is a disaster indicator, given
its devastating impact on people and socio-economic
infrastructure." (...)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "19. The rainfall registered over the past days

altered all technical references. The rivers in Maputo
province rose so drastically that it  was difficult to
read the measuring scales."
