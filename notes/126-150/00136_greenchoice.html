Austin's Future is Powerful
<P>
by Bruce Sterling
<P>
It hasn't yet achieved the stirring fanfare it deserves,
but we Austinites have the cheapest Green energy program
in the nation.
<P>
You can click on an Austin website
(<A HREF="http://www.austinenergy.com/greenchoice/">http://www.austinenergy.com/greenchoice/</A>) and buy clean,
renewable Texan solar and wind power to run your Austin
business and your Austin home through Austin Energy's
GreenChoice program.
<P>
Let me tell you, at some length and with total,
passionate conviction, why it is that all us Austinites
should do this.
<P>
Ladies and gentlemen, we Austinites no longer have to
pay any of our hard-earned money for nuclear or coal.
This is the year 2000,  and our situation is new and
improved.   Our mayor and our city council are doing the
right and proper thing with this Green Choice program.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Oh yes, I know that's hard to believe == after 28
</BLOCKQUOTE>
years living here, I'm a skeptic myself == but during
those  shining moments when one's local government does
something genuinely farsighted and sensible, it behooves
one to jump right up and cheer.   Let me do so.
Marketing clean energy is a genius move.  It is a direct,
practical, hands-on, real-world way forward for our city.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Think of it this way. Remember way back in the early
</BLOCKQUOTE>
1980s, when the city was cutting all those deals with non-
polluting, high-tech computer industries?  Well, that  was
a canny industrial-policy move, very much like this one.
It looked a little futuristic and unlikely, but it paid-
off big time.   That is why this newspaper has an entire
high-tech section full of home-made millionaires.  That is
why we are not Houston now.  Aren't you glad we're not
Houston?  Houston is the smoggiest city in America.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  We got ahead of the technological curve, and  we
</BLOCKQUOTE>
got ahead of the skeptics, and we did something smart.
And it worked.  After decades of being that hippie-dog-
neckerchief, tamale-eatin' river town, we are the cutting-
edge.  We have an influence on the future of  American
life which is way out of proportion to our numbers.
Because we have what the New Economy wants: brains,
initiative, daring, capital, and, especially, high quality
of life.
<P>
So far, so good.  Initiative, we've got.  We're not
gonna get any dumber here.   Money is all over this city
like never before.   Quality of life, that is our weak
point.  A very weak point.  An agony for us, even.    For
decades on end, we've obsessed about that.  It's been at
the heart of every sign-waving, eco-neighborhood trauma,
and every cement-spewing developer squabble here since
Earth Day 1970.   It is our torment.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  And we are losing, just like Houston.   The EPA is
</BLOCKQUOTE>
on Austin's case right now.   We're choking in smoke from
our streams of shiny new cars.  Smoke from all our
computer keyboards.   A computer  is "clean industry,"
but coal plants are a computer's biggest and ugliest
desktop peripherals.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Austin's high tech can't run for one nanosecond
</BLOCKQUOTE>
without electric power.  We use a lot of electrical power
here == and it's dirty power.  This simply should not be.
We are allowing our own success to ruin our great
situation here.  We are bringing this directly on
ourselves.  There is no one else to blame for this.  There
isn't any place to hide from the air.   But now we can
grapple with this thing head-on:  new, clean power is
here.  It's 2000, it's time to move forward.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  You have an individual choice today.  The power is
</BLOCKQUOTE>
smack-dab in your own hands.   You can stop sending a
chunk of your paycheck to foul our air.  You can send it
to people who'll clean it.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  The tired, traditional, eco-freak solution to this
</BLOCKQUOTE>
problem is to rush off and find some bureaucracy big
enough to tame ExxonMobil.  Forget about that.   Austin
didn't get rich in the computer industry by suing IBM in
federal court for twenty years.    Austin gets rich by
being direct.    You know, like Mike Dell.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  So be direct.   I'm telling you to cut the
</BLOCKQUOTE>
polluter's revenue stream.  Put your money into a new,
smarter, Texan industry.
<P>
We Texans were way ahead of the curve in the global
oil industry.  We dug up and and sold our oil years ago.
Today, we Texans import more oil than we export.  That
just won't do.   We need to move Texas into the next Texan
energy industry.  A clean, renewable energy industry, with
worldwide potential, that makes us money.  We've got wind
and we've got solar.   Solar panels are made of silicon.
There are windmills all over Texas.
<P>
What we don't have is broad market demand for clean
energy.  If the demand is there, the clean energy industry
will boot up at Internet speed.  The tech is workable
today, and the demand is up to you, personally.   If
people in Austin demand this, then presto, demand exists.
If Austin wants it, it's trendy by definition.
<P>

       You sign up for Green energy and you *buy stock in<BR>
 the new energy companies.*   New Economy/New Energy.   If<BR>
 we get enough momentum behind it, it's a self-fulfilling<BR>
<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
prophecy.  The early adopters will be on the ground floor
of a new  energy industry.  It's a step we have to take.
In the years to come, if everyone on Earth burns coal ==
China, India, the lot of them == we simply  won't be able
to breathe.  But if they all use clean energy, they'll
become our customers.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Austin's Green Choice program costs about fifty
</BLOCKQUOTE>
bucks a year for the average Austinite.  That is the best
part: it's the cheapest such program in the USA.  It is a
nothing-deal to spend or save fifty bucks on a year's
power bills.   Why would any sane person fret about that?
I certainly don't.  Each and every year, I put on a big
Christmas light-show for my fellow Austinites, here on
Cedar around the corner from 37th Street.  You may have
noticed my house, if you were among  those vast Christmas
throngs.  My house is the only 1912-looking Arts &amp; Crafts
home in the city that has a three-kilowatt, city-
subsidized, solar generation station on top.    It's
clean, silent, and it works great!  I'm pumping clean
energy into your house right now, and you didn't even know
it!
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  You see, I no longer collaborate with smog.  I'm no
</BLOCKQUOTE>
longer part of the problem.  I don't have to make any
excuses for the sorry fact that the stars at night are no
longer bright, deep in the heart of Texas.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  The future is on top of my house, today.  The future
</BLOCKQUOTE>
is powerful.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  Hey, we're neighbors.  You want some hard evidence?
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Come stand on my sidewalk and look.
