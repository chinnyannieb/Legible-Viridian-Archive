So far, real power is winning.    Real power is winning in some cases because it represents responsibility, common sense and the will of the people. Example: keeping Germany in NATO.     Real power also wins where it merely represents common sense and the will of the people. Example: not making gasoline in Germany cost three times as much as any other country in Europe.     And in some cases, real power is winning from the will of the people alone. Example: no speed limits on the autobahn.     One of the reasons that the Greens are not very Viridian is that large chunks of them are still quite technophobic. At the grass roots level, many German Greens believe that technology is inherently dehumanizing, and they pretend that they can just say 'nein danke' to the whole thing.    Greens are good at picket signs, and they're getting better at parliaments, but they're not going to invent anything that changes the world. Furthermore, after so many years in opposition, they're much better at stopping things than advancing them. A Viridian era needs more.    There are, however, some good signs. The Greens are showing more discipline than their industrial-era coalition partners. The Greens are willing to take on sacred cows. And the Greens are showing more signs of learning than the other parties. All of these traits give them Viridian potential.    At the level of specific policies, however, expect progress to be slow. Changing a third of Germany's energy sources in eight years is ambitious, headline-grabbing, and almost certainly impossible. This is a country that took the better part of ten years to extend permissible shopping hours by ninety minutes.  Germany has just significantly modified its citizenship laws for the first time since a Kaiser ruled in Berlin. Besides, the only thing Germany would replace nuclear power with right now is more carbon-based fuel. (It's one thing for the Swedes to buy wind power from the Danes; it's quite another trying to run the world's third largest economy on windmills.)      Another test of Green strength would be phasing out subsidies to coal miners. German taxpayers support a tidy living for German miners, paying lots of marks to keep up an industry that's both loss-making and polluting. But miners are heroes to social democrats, so the Greens probably lose this one as well.     Germany will probably introduce some form of 'eco-tax' this coming year, probably a consumption tax on fuels somewhat like the BTU tax that died such a painful death in the US. An eco-tax has become fashionable in the very German duty- and guilt-ridden sense. It's not attractive, it's simply understood in the orthodoxy that this is something you have to do. This may be politically effective, but I find it unappealing. (I'm also already paying 45% taxes on a researcher's salary, so the notion of any further taxation offends me terribly.) Guilt doesn't strike me as very Viridian.     Those are the key points. I'll see if I can get a digital picture of Munich Re for you, to go along with those sexy articles on insurance.best,Doug MerrillResearch Group on the Global FutureCenter for Applied Policy ResearchUniversity of Munichhoechst.forum@lrz.uni-muenchen.deBruce Sterling remarks:    How very useful and interesting.  Thank you very much.   Now, for further insight on the European energy policy scene, we quote a recent installment of the column "Europe This Week" by veteran British journalist Martin Walker.Source:  Manchester Guardian Weekly. November 29, 1998, page 6.    "To begin with the horror stories: the $900 million earmarked by the EU for repairing and making safe the nuclear power plants of the old Soviet Bloc has been either wasted, lost, defrauded or left unspent.  'It is particularly worrying that, at the end of 1997, it was not possible to judge whether there had been any actual progress in terms of nuclear safety,' Bernhard Friedmann, president of the Court of Auditors, told the European Parliament.    "The nuclear scandal was simply the most chilling of a series of accounting disasters and bungles afflicting every aspect of Europe's finances.  It was also the most shaming, because the EU sought and won the agreement of the Group of Seven leading industrial nations to manage the international community's rescue efforts for the 65 sick and dangerous Soviet nuclear power plants.  Trusted by its allies and Russians alike, the EU bungled the job."
