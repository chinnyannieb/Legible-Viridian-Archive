Suppose there is not a global warming age coming, but a global ice age.Suppose science determines that the only solution to avert the next ice age is to deforest the planet.  To burn as much as the fossil fuels as we can, to heat up the planet in any way we can.   Of course this is hypothetical; my question though is for the Viridians. (((Very well!  The Pope-Emperor stands ready to issue definitive bulls on all Viridian moral questions.)))If environmental science showed that there was indeed an ice age coming, and that our best course of action was to deforest as much land as possible, could the Viridians get behind this project? (((The short answer is yes.(((The long answer deconstructs your trick question.  It's absurd to posit that the best way of fighting glaciers is by killing forests. You could cover glaciers with a thin layer of sun-absorbing soot, for instance.  You could supply increased planetary heat much more cheaply, directly and effectively than with saws and bulldozers in forests.  But if I accept your absurd premise, and if scholars agree that the only alternative is either miles of glacial ice on top of the forests, or cutting the forests down first to retard the ice, then of course we cut down the forests.  Absolutely.)))If science runs counter to the emotional tenor of the Viridian laws, who wins?(((Science.)))Or in other words, is the Viridian allegiance to principles, or to evidence?(((The allegiance is to evidence.)))Could you imagine yourself ever getting the troops rallied up to cut down trees in the park because the scientists said so?(((I very much doubt I'll ever find myself rallying troops; I lack a field lieutenant's proper frame of mind.  But the enthusiastic destruction of forests doesn't require any act of imagination.  It's happening now in real life.  It's not a hypothesis, it's as direct and real as smoke and sawdust.  With today's absurd set-up, I'm ordering forests cut down every time I order a hamburger.  The chopping and the burning isn't remotely perceived as a moral problem of the kind that you posit here.  And even if it were, a moral conundrum and forty-five cents will get you a cup of coffee. The problem's not created with flags, philosophy, scientific authority or moral exhortation.  It's created in everyday actions in everyday life, through the crazy market demands of a foul, primitive, unsustainable technological base. (((I'm glad we've had a chance to clear this up.)))Kevin Kelly (kevin@wired.com^*)
