Subject:  Viridian Note 00012:  Web LinksKey concepts:  Web links, Viridian rankingAttention Conservation Notice:  There is very little content in this Note.  It consists of a long list of links that may or may not be of interest, plus the second Viridian Ranking.Links:  it's mostly linksSomeday it may be useful and constructive to have a list of official Viridian-approved links.  Or will it?  People on the Internet link with such carefree abandon that it makes one wonder.  Links are perceived somehow as an unalloyed good.  This is a sign of danger in any technological development.  A link unaccompanied by critical assessment is a little attention-bomb.  For our successors, the novelty of links may fade; the kudzu-like mess of links may seem stale or even poisonous. Giving someone a list of hotlinks might be seen as vaguely passive-aggressive, as if you had crammed his doors and windows with endless stacks of free encyclopedias and giveaway floppy disks.    Thanks to the kindness of alert correspondents, we have accumulated many Viridian-associated links.  But what do they all mean?  And how do they feel?  And what is their real context?  Are they really worth our while?  What do they promise for the future?  Who will tell us about all this?  Investigate these links, if you will.  Think about these questions.  Write us a careful and heartfelt assessment.  Be frank!  If your criticism makes the list, you will earn a star >*<.  You will vault toward the top of the Viridian ranks.http://www.02.orghttp://www.oecd.org/subject/sustdev/oecdwork.htmwww.carfree.comwww.biothinking.comwww.agewave.comwww.bridgedesign.comhttp://www.hoechst-forum.uni-muenchen.dehttp://www.va.com.au/photobots/PhotoBots.htmhttp://environment.miningco.com/library/weekly/aa110198.htmwww.millennium.ruwww.gadget.co.zawww.media.mit.edu/~rhodes/RAwww.well.com/~mgoldhhttp://slashdot.orgwww.rprogress.orghttp://www.users.interport.net/~jam/sld001.htm http://www.sirius.com/~schizo/demo/start.htmhttp://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/1998/10/981030082447.htmhttp://www.nyu.edu/publicaffairs/newsreleases/b_NYU_S4.shtmlhttp://www.sunday-times.co.uk:80/news/pages/Times/frontpage.html?1029057http://www.nytimes.com/library/review/110198america-energy-review.htmlhttp://www.pnl.gov/news/1998/98mthf.htm http://www.scientificsales.com/balloons.htmhttp://www.zamg.ac.at/~map-pbl/home.htmhttp://www.fooledya.com/balloon/http://www.af.mil/news/airman/0298/bombsb.htmhttp://www.loe.org/html/headlines/coffins.htmlwww.realgoods.comhttp://arch.virginia.edu/Dean/http://www.virginia.edu/~sustain/http://www.arsdigita.com/services.htmlwww.europeangreens.orghttp://dailynews.yahoo.com/headlines/wr/story.html?s=v/nm/19981104/wr/paper__1.htmlwww.seedsource.comhttp://www.energy.rochester.edu/cogen_europe/http://www.ad.ic.ac.uk/estates/projects/chp/descrip.htmhttp://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/msad26oct98_1.htmhttp://www.newscientist.com/nsplus/insight/global/global.htmlThe Viridian Ranking System has been hand-created with a vintage fountain pen and fine art paper. Scars, flaws, and imperfections add character and are an inherent part of the product.jim@smallworks.com^^^^^^^^*jon@lasser.org^^^*rsewell@cix.compulink.co.uk^^^*rinesi@espacio.com.ar^^*LangiG@parl.gc.ca^*weasel@gothic.net^*richardd@reeseco.com*jonl@well.com^^^^^dhlight@mcs.net^^^^cthomas@10fold.com^^^Ian.Griffin@Corp.Sun.COM^^^Cooper409@aol.com^^geert@xs4all.nl^^pacoid@fringeware.com^^rdm@test.legislate.com^^robot@ultimax.com^^SeJ@aol.com^^tbyfield@panix.com^^thack@design-inst.nl^^TuckerV@frogdesign.com^^ASKornheiser@prodigy.net^Basilisk@mcione.com^bobmorris@mediaone.net^ccraig@ucsd.edu^c.ted.ballou@intel.com^dave@va.com.au^dc@technomedia.com^dlandry@rohan.sdsu.edu^gagin@inter.net.ru^gail@well.com^ggg@well.com^gordy@nytimes.com^infinite@beaming.com^jrc@well.com^kallen@physics.ucsd.edu^kaiser@acm.org^klilly@neog.com^mann@cse.unsw.edu.au^melcher@unix.nets.com^merlan@visa.com^nehrlich@sfis.com^philg@martigny.ai.mit.edu^quest@inetarena.com^roger@bayarea.net^sblack@library.berkeley.edu^steffen@eskimo.com^steven@iisl.co.uk^sdhurley@ican.net^udhay@pobox.com^WarrenE@aol.com^wex@media.mit.edu^whh@uclink4.berkeley.edu^whiz@ricochet.net^
