(...)  The most severe 1998disasters listed in the report include Hurricane Mitch,the deadliest Atlantic storm in 200 years, which hascaused more than 10,000 deaths in Honduras, Nicaragua,Guatemala and El Salvador, and caused damage estimated at$4 billion in Honduras and $1 billion in Nicaragua.  (...)Central American nations have experienced some of thehighest rates of deforestation in the world, losing from 2percent to 4 percent of their remaining forest cover eachyear, said the study.     "The costliest disaster of 1998, according to thereport, was the flooding of the Yangtze River in thesummer.  It killed more than 3,000 people, dislocatedabout 230 million people, and incurred $30 billion inlosses.   (...)      "Figures include infrastructure losses and crops butnot long-term effects such as increased health costs andenvironmental damage.  Prices in 1998 dollars."Bruce Sterling remarks:     This is, needless to say, a remarkably grim report.The year is not yet over, but the evil weather of 1998 hasalready caused more global havoc than was created in theentire 1980s.  Worse yet, it's a fifty percent jump from amere two years ago.  The trend for two years hence, andten years hence, is anything but reassuring.     Still, it's pleasant to have some stark facts andfigures on the subject of just how badly off we are.  "Adecade's worth of weather damage in a single year" --that is a  useful and provocative soundbite.     This is not armageddon. We will not be suddenlyrendered extinct because of our misdeeds with C02. Thirty-two thousand dead people are a remarkably modest number ofdead, considering that the planet boasts about 6 billionpeople now.  Even a country with the limitedorganizational resources of China lost a mere 3,000 liveswhen floods displaced a full 230,000,000. Even $89 billiondollars is a modest sum compared to the wealth destructionentailed in the Asian financial crisis.    But flooding is expensive.  Hence the concentratedinterest of Munich Re, the German insurance group.  MunichRe were first brought to my attention by David Light(dhlight@mcs.net^^^^^*).  Munich Re, also known asMunchener Ruck, would seem to be a remarkably interestingenterprise, for an insurance firm.    In the next Viridian Note, we will examine some ofMunich Re's analytical tools, and the company's expertconclusions on the subject of global warming.  Then wewill speculate on what this means and how it feels.Bruce Sterling (bruces@well.com)
