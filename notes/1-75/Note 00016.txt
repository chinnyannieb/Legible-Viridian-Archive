The interesting thing about this  recent New York Times ethanol article (as opposed to the 100 others I've skimmed over the last 20 years) is that serious things are being financed with (mostly) private capital at a time when oil prices are in the basement."Plant Will Make Fuel Oil From Agricultural Garbage"By MATTHEW L. WALD(((bruces remarks: I have cut the living daylights out of Mr Wald's fine article and added a number of comments of my own.)))      "ENNINGS, Louisiana.   The plant was opened in 1977 to refine  crude oil into gasoline, but when that proved unprofitable,   it was converted in 1981 to run on molasses, and then in 1987, on   grain.  Bankruptcy followed."(((The bankruptcy of *all* oil refineries is on the 21st century's agenda.  We might replace them through clever design, or we might simply run out of oil, but oil refineries are goners either way.  It's wise to consider alternative uses for all this  refinery hardware.)))     "Now, with rust on its tanks and pipes and grass growing through   the gravel on its paths, construction workers are converting it  yet again, to make fuel alcohol from agricultural garbage. (...)  The new  owners of the plant here, BC International Corp., with a subsidy  from the U.S. Energy Department and help from a genetically engineered, patented bacterium, hope they are on the cusp of a new era."     (((Staggering back from the brink of the grave, a rust-eaten, Gothic,  Cajun oil refinery becomes home of gene-spliced voodoo gumbo.  It's a new era all right -- the Dawn of the Dead.)))     "'It is a bio-refinery,' said Stephen Gatto, president and chief  executive of the company.  (...)     "'The input costs are close to zero,' said Dan Reicher, assistant secretary of energy. 'In some cases they are less than zero,  because people are paying to get rid of these materials.'"     (((The economics of "less than zero" costs have a nice Internet IPO feel to them == "We're selling dollars for ninety cents each, and making it up on market share!")))     "And if it works, he said, the technology could also reduce the accumulation of gases in the atmosphere that are thought to cause climate change, and could lower smog.  (((It'll be a sign of intellectual life in American journalism when this "thought to cause" phraseology finally vanishes.  Yes, the climate is changing, and yes, gases are doing it.  Cigarettes cause cancer.  Politicians have sex.  Let's move on.)))     "The plant here in this south-central Louisiana town will run on  bagasse, a part of the sugar cane plant usually considered useless, as well as on rice hulls, a currently useless part of the rice plant. Later, it may digest sawdust as well."     (((The American  sugar industry is notorious for its price supports.  Rice hulls and sawdust, however...  as feedstock for a value-adding process, those are hard to beat. There are few nations on earth untroubled by rice hulls or sawdust. Or both.)))    "Around the country, energy experts have their eyes on clippings from suburban lawns, prairie grasses and other woody materials,  as fuel for the new process. (...)  In the current generation of ethanol plants, the fuel is the corn kernel; plants using the new technology could digest the cob and  the stalk as well. (...)"    (((We should definitely keep a wary eye out for any entity that digests corn, plus its cobs, plus its stalks.)))     "These materials are made of cellulose, which contains large  amounts of sugar, the basic ingredient required for alcohol production. But the sugar in cellulose is in a chemical form that traditional fermentation processes, which use yeast, cannot digest. (...)  BC's plant uses a bacterium, KO11, also used in the pharmaceutical industry, to break down the sugars.     "The natural bacterium on which KO11 is based likes to eat  sugars and produces a chemical called acetic acid.  But then came gene splicing.  Dr. Lonnie Ingram, a microbiologist at the  University of Florida's Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences, borrowed four genes from another organism, Zymomonas mobilis, to make the bacterium produce alcohol  instead.    "Around the country, researchers are working with Z. mobilis to find other approaches, but BC International's will be the first commercial plant to make ethanol from woody material. The plant will take about 18 months to build and will cost $90  million, including $11 million from the Energy Department.   "Existing ethanol plants do little to save energy or reduce carbon  build-up in the atmosphere. They can use up to seven gallons of  oil or its energy equivalent to produce eight gallons of  ethanol, experts say. The energy is used by the coal in power plants and  diesel fuel in tractors that plant, fertilize and harvest the  corn, and in petroleum-based fertilizer. But using waste for fuel ==   especially waste that might otherwise be burned and in the process dump carbon dioxide back into the air == could allow production of seven gallons of ethanol from one gallon of oil."     (((Biomass is an attractive technology, especially for continental superpowers with plenty of spare real estate, but these hidden carbon subsidies are troubling.  Cheap oil can make fake "alternatives" look better than they are, lowering costs but spewing CO2. Smart germs are no panacea.  There are probably many ways to use cheap commercial bacteria profitably, while creating CO2 pollution even worse than cheap crude oil.)))        "And whatever the feedstock, whether trees or grasses, using it makes room for new growth, which will draw carbon back out of the atmosphere. This would be true, backers point out, wherever ethanol from cellulose might catch on, in this country or abroad, especially the Third World, where demand for motor fuel is rising."   (...)     (((Third Worlders have a healthy skepticism for  clever technologies that are said to be a bonanza for poor people, even though they never quite work out  in the daily life of rich people.)))     "The plant here, on the banks of the Mermentau River, is designed to produce 20 million gallons a year (...)  Several others using cellulose   are planned around the country. One company, Masada Resource, of Birmingham, Ala., says it will break ground next year on a plant in Middletown, N.Y., that will use the cellulose in  household garbage. In that case, sales of ethanol will not turn a profit but will help offset the cost of garbage disposal, in a  region where a large landfill is scheduled to close soon. It will not use KO11, but a different proprietary process for rendering the cellulose into digestible form."(...)     (((This article has many fine specifics, but contains one mysterious oversight.  The subject under study here is a bug that makes booze out of sawdust.  This is a troubling prospect.  Once Cajun bootleggers swipe a few thimblefulls of stray K011 out of the plant, we can expect a swamplands moonshine bonanza the likes of which the world has never seen.)))  Copyright 1998 The New York Times Company*******************************************************WHY GENETICALLY RETROFITTED REFINERIES ARE NOT VIRIDIAN*******************************************************They cost 90 million dollars each.American sugar cane is a boondoggle. Ethanol projects are not new and have a bad track record.It's hard to make agricultural waste and rotting organic garbage seem sexy.Ethanol in fuel is a piecemeal improvement in the existent refinery/gas station/ internal combustion complex.Has K011 been properly "designed for evil"?  How are we supposed to police new germs?  Through patent and copyright law?  That's not much help in the thriving black markets for illegal drugs or pirate software.    The abuse potential for illegal stills that eat sawdust and lawn clippings would seem to be pretty extreme. Brewer's yeasts turn up in the heart of federal prisons; even prisoner-of-war camps have illegal stills. Prohibition wars leave police forces reeling and riddled with corruption.  This is a brand-new drug technology, and a potential security nightmare.***************************************************WHY GENETICALLY RETROFITTED REFINERIES ARE VIRIDIAN***************************************************They might realistically improve the CO2 situation.They embrace decay.They eat what they kill:   it's thrifty to re-use abandoned oil refinery stock, especially since we'll eventually be stuck with all that hardware anyway.Incremental improvements may not be glamorous, but they are by no means to be despised.  If ethanol works without requiring glamour, we can save our time and attention for promoting something else.A working, profit-making genetic bio-refinery would open the door to *custom-designed* genetic bio-refineries.  These could be highly novel and unusual structures with a revolutionary impact on the chemical and refining industries generally.  To see daylight, though, they need a money-making app in the contemporary world.FORMATTING NOTE:  Peter Denning (pjd@cne.gmu.edu^^) has pointed out that it would be easier to ignore Viridian Notes if they came with titles.  We will be titling the Notes henceforth, and will probably go back and retrospectively title the earlier ones.  Bruce S
