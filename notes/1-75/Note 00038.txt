In this manifesto, we Viridians must summarize our multifarious research activities in a single coherent ideological presentation, meant to enlighten the new millennium.  This task may well be impossible.  We may have no design movement at all: just a *prediction* of a design movement.  In many ways, utter failure is a rather attractive prospect.Still, we do have a year.******************VIRIDIAN APHORISMS******************Send an apt Viridian aphorism and you will receive a chevron >^<"Sentiment without action is the ruin of the soul."  Edward Abbey"Courage, garrulousness and the mob are on our side.

They are eight years old.  Planted on Class I soil here in Northern California. Surrounded by high tech tiltup office buildings. I'm holding out. This computer thing just ain't gonna last. When you're thirsty, are you gonna drink Pentium-ade? When you want a nice dessert, are you gonna make PowerPC Pie?  No, lemons are what you'll need.      And I've got 'em.     I heard the cold weather prediction on an IRC chat, days before the weather bureau let the secret out. The meteorologists had invested heavily in citrus futures when they saw the indications of a massive cold front coming. Naturally, most of them kept the word to themselves.     I went down to Salvation Army and told them I was helping the homeless. They gave me a stack of old blankets and sheets, and with my family and a handful of fellows from Oaxaca what I met outside of Home Depot, I covered our lemon crop (and a few oranges). We started  illegal smut pot fires a day early, to fight the frost.  The cold swept in, ravaging our hibiscus and pyracantha and the winter vegetable garden, but the lemons were saved!    I sold all my Amazon, eBay, and Yahoo stocks. I don't need 'em now.  I got rare California citrus, and my roadside stand is doing a great business, except for the fights that break out when customers think someone cut the ration line.   The Y2K hoarders are squirreling away the late 98 crop of lemons for the big rollover in a year.  I tell them we have enough. I make sure little kids get one free lemon, and the local school cafeteria gets one free basket each week.    Lemons are my life, and I'm doing great this year.
