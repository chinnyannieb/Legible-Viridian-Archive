See Note 00002 for details on the Viridian Ranking System.)Source:  Most of these aphorisms come from THE VIKING BOOK OF APHORISMS by W. H. Auden and Louis Kronenberger, first assembled in 1962.  Entries in the "Big Mike" Viridian Design Contest:http://www.pinknoiz.com/graphics/bigmike.gifhttp://www.spaceways.de/BigMike/Mike.htmlhttp://weber.u.washington.edu/~r1ddl3r/bigmike.htmlhttp://powerbase-alpha.com/bigmikehttp://rampages.onramp.net/~jzero/http://www.well.com/conf/mirrorshadeshttp://www.57thstreet.com/viridian/******************VIRIDIAN APHORISMS******************(((bruces remarks:  we Viridians won't have time to accumulate our own wisdom of the ages, but we can certainly take the wisdom already to  hand and put our own vivifying spin on it.   "An epoch doesn't so much reinvent itself as reimagine its heritage" -- STERLING)))It takes time to ruin a world, but time is all it takes.  FONTENELLEA historian is a prophet in reverse.  SCHEGELPersistent prophesy is a familiar way of assuring the event.  GISSINGOur ignorance of history makes us vilify our own age.  FLAUBERTHistorical textbooks always seem to make three claims about the era they are dealing with:  it was a period of change; it was essentially a transitional epoch; and the middle classes went on rising.  EAGLETONEach generation criticizes the unconscious assumptions made by its parents.  It may assent to them, but it brings them out in the open.  WHITEHEADThe historian must have some conception of how men who are not historians behave.  FORSTERProgress is the mother of problems.  CHESTERTONThe obscurest epoch is today.  STEVENSONFrom such crooked wood as that which man is made of, nothing straight can be fashioned.  KANTEvery luxury must be paid for, and everything is a luxury, starting with being in the world.  PAVESELong years must pass before the truths we have made for ourselves become our very flesh.  VALERYTo know oneself is to foresee oneself; to foresee oneself amounts to playing a part.  VALERYHow many of our daydreams would darken into nightmares, were there any danger of their coming true.  LOGAN PEARSALL SMITHAmong all human constructions the only ones that avoid the dissolving hands of time are castles in the air.  DE ROBERTO(((More to come.  People who send us a good Viridian aphorism will earn a chevron.  bruces)))****************VIRIDIAN RANKING****************The Viridian Ranking System has been hand-created with a vintage fountain pen and fine art paper. Scars, flaws, and imperfections add character and are an inherent part of the product.jon@lasser.org^^^**rsewell@cix.compulink.co.uk^^^**jim@smallworks.com^^^^^^^^*dhlight@mcs.net^^^^^*rinesi@espacio.com.ar^^*SeJ@aol.com^^*steffen@eskimo.com^^*wex@media.mit.edu^^*whiz@ricochet.net^^*LangiG@parl.gc.ca^*weasel@gothic.net^*hinne@spaceways.de*jzero@onramp.net*mgoldh@well.com*pinknoiz@pinknoiz.com*r1ddl3r@bp13.u.washington.edu*richardd@reeseco.com*tux@powerbase-alpha.com*jonl@well.com^^^^^Ian.Griffin@Corp.Sun.COM^^^^Cooper409@aol.com^^^cthomas@10fold.com^^^tor@araneum.dk^^^bobmorris@mediaone.net^^bperry@shore.net^^geert@xs4all.nl^^pacoid@fringeware.com^^pjd@cne.gmu.edu^^rdm@test.legislate.com^^robot@ultimax.com^^tbyfield@panix.com^^thack@design-inst.nl^^TuckerV@frogdesign.com^^ASKornheiser@prodigy.net^Basilisk@mcione.com^ccraig@ucsd.edu^c.ted.ballou@intel.com^dave@va.com.au^dc@technomedia.com^dlandry@rohan.sdsu.edu^gagin@inter.net.ru^gail@well.com^ggg@well.com^gordy@nytimes.com^infinite@beaming.com^jrc@well.com^kallen@physics.ucsd.edu^kaiser@acm.org^katie@wtp.net^kirk@mcelhearn.com^klilly@neog.com^Matt@MediaServ.com^mann@cse.unsw.edu.au^melcher@unix.nets.com^merlan@visa.com^mwiik@brysonweb.com^nehrlich@sfis.com^philg@martigny.ai.mit.edu^quest@inetarena.com^roger@bayarea.net^rthieme@thiemeworks.com^sblack@library.berkeley.edu^shassinger@dev.tivoli.com^steven@iisl.co.uk^sdhurley@ican.net^StJude@aol.com^tdav@wam.umd.edu^tenev@digbody.dux.ru^udhay@pobox.com^viridian@access.spring.net^WarrenE@aol.com^whh@uclink4.berkeley.edu^
