The following is a brief descriptive list of various self-declared prophets, aesthetic gurus, and/or cultural figures, most of whom became highly influential, although they lacked democratic legitimacy, legal authority, or academic certification.  We do not by any means endorse the activities of these widely differing people.   We only note that their careers, interests, tactics and cultural position might be seen as historically analogous to the Viridian effort, and might offer useful lessons.  One should profit by the historical errors of precursors, since they were kind enough to take the trouble of committing them.Petronius Arbiter:  poet, novelist, critic, courtier, satirist.
