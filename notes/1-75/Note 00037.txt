Landry)D. Landry remarks:Out here in California, an El Nino inspired frost, combined with a late growing season due to El Nino storms earlier in the year, have spelled disaster for our citrus crop.Fact:  Over 80% of navel oranges (the kind you eat, not the juice type) grown in the U.S. are grown in California.Fact:  Over 90% of lemons in the U.S. are grown in California.Fact:  Over half of our oranges, and almost all of our lemons,  froze and are inedible, a huge chunk of California's giant agricultural industry.Soon to be Fact:  Table oranges in the USA are going to cost 2-4 times what they did last week, for at least a full year, unless we start importing produce, a very unlikely prospect.What does this event mean for Viridians?Well, first off, it's one more thing to chalk up to our deteriorating climate, and a final blow of expensive weather violence in an awful year.    Second, Joe Average may soon join the scientists in realizing that we're screwed.  This hits Americans where it hurts....not in the lungs like smog, not in the quality of life, but right in the pocket book.  Henceforth even Californians will be paying around $1.00/LBS for table fruit.  The lettuce, avocado, and strawberry crops have also taken a hit.  When you witness foot-long icicles hanging from lemon trees, in Central California farmland, you don't need much more rhetoric about weather change.(((bruces remarks:  Can anyone offer us good online pictures of these California icicles?)))     Californian farmers will be recovering for several years before they're back on their feet financially. (Assuming, that is, that weather violence in future doesn't hit them again and again.)    How do we use this event as Viridians?    We might create satirical or inspirational art, regarding frost-bedevilled and genetically mutated citrus fruits.  Ideally, this would be printed on sports bottles (for lemonade), orange peelers, breakfast cups, fruit baskets/hangers, and similar food related paraphernalia, preferably made from Viridian-approved recycled materials.  Personally, I'd be willing to donate $5 or so to buy a few pounds of oranges.    We might appeal to farmers, and gain some allies in a profession where people have been preoccupied with weather for the last four millennia.     The people hardest hit by this are going to be farm owners, many of them corporate.   And the California farm workers, many of whom are migrant laborers, with little or no access to media, sensors, or even education, much less any bent towards environmental activism.      It's hard to find a glamorous and upbeat aspect to this. (((Courage my brother:  these crazed anomalies are happening to me, you, and to people all over the world, urban/rural, rich/poor, online/offline.  That's the upbeat angle:  the lash may strike, but the beast will move.)))From: whiz@ricochet.net^^^** (Michael Treece)Your Holiness-Majesty:More downsides of the wind-power notion:1.  Here in Northern California, we have an awesome wind farm in the Altamont Pass.  It's just never turned on.  Quite apart from the damage it does to birds (including threatened raptors), the utility companies have done their best to ruin it by deferring scheduled maintenance and making spare parts rare and dear.  Maybe large and centralized isn't the way to go; this might be a job for the off-the-grid kids.2.  The only way Royal Dutch Shell is going to participate in this project is if it kills Nigerians.  Work that angle out, and they're all yours. (((bruces remarks: I have every confidence that people will end up getting killed over wind power if it's deployed and handled properly.  As for the bird problem, let's compare a forest of flying blades to giant broken oil tankers.)))From: MICHAEL.HARTLEY@one2one.co.uk*  (Michael Hartley)Season's greetings from England, currently bathing in CO2 fuelled winter storms.I've been following Andy Goldsworthy's work here in the UK. Some of his tide pool works were done on the coast just a few miles from my home town. As I type this, there's a Goldsworthy postcard in the 'geekosphere' of found objects which surrounds my desk. This postcard attracts more astonished questions than any of my other junk. You ask:  "Does the world require more than one artist who wants to place wet flower petals on rocks?"     Why be an 'artist'?  Goldsworthy's work inspires me with its use of freely available, natural media and its simple hands-on techniques. Granted, it's Goldsworthy's talent to produce something with visual appeal and originality, but it's really only a matter of getting out there into your garden, park, beach, opening up your own imagination and putting something together.     Maybe it's impossible to "make dozens of art careers out of coloring tide pools green," but given its accessibility, why should this art involve careerism?    "How big could it be?  Suppose you were given a giant abandoned strip mine..."    I live next door to an abandoned railway line, which has recently been transformed into a bicycle track.   (Recreational bicycles "eat what they kill" in replacing dead industrial steam-trains, a very Viridian situation.) Every so often, I set out for the day to make/plant something on the abandoned line or in the wooded areas close by.  My main stuff (not good enough to call them 'pieces'!)  is reclaimed bits of old railway hardware interwoven with bracken (decaying) and ivy (growing). I also do a bit of "guerrilla planting:"  find a bit of waste land, and introduce plants which are... different....... to those already there.  See also:http://www.sculpture.org.uk/archive/goldherd.htmlfor the Goldworthy installation  "Herd of Arches." What I find interesting here is Goldworthy's use of housing stone in a work which echoes architectural forms, set in the background of an abandoned quarry.On the subject of decaying industrial aesthetics:Carhenge: installation art using scrapped cars sited in a cornfield in western Nebraska, off US 385http://www.mse.berkeley.edu/Staff/Eve/carhenge.htmlhttp://tom.gunter.com/onvacation/carhenge.htmlhttp://www.public.iastate.edu/~jredders/carhenge.htmlhttp://www.srv.net/~jonwot/placespix.htmlhttp://www.frankwu.com/carhenge4.htmlhttp://212.net/carhenge/carhenge.htmhttp://www.ground.com/ (This uses carhenge imagery as cultural icon)http://www.roadway.com/offroad_2_june.html (carhenge imagery exploited by a trucking company)http://metalab.unc.edu/sito/MASS/Merriman_C/animation.html (A Macromind Projector animation of the rise and fall of Carhenge, Alliance, Nebraska)http://www.roadsideamerica.com/set/OVERhenges.html (Other henges, worth  a look as modern interpetation of age old works)More on the theme of  "What does a bio/post/industrial landscape look like when you put the profit motive aside?"Anti-road art protesters destroying roadbeds:http://www.gn.apc.org/rts/sp'96/newsp.htm     I quote:  "Go back to the pantomime dame in pink fluff. Under cover of the techno music is a steely noise. Under cover of the skirts is something quite other; four men and a pneumatic drill are digging up the motorway and planting trees. It is the spike under the fluff. For this is the nature of carnival, the order turned upside down."Happy 1999Mike Hartley(((bruces remarks:  monkeywrenching roadbeds is an illegal direct-action that will likely get you arrested whether you're wearing a tutu or not.  It's rather more Viridian to destroy and replant roadbeds that no longer see use.  You won't get many self-appointed saboteurs there, but it's nice work for the elderly.)))From: ljaurbach@erols.com^* (L.
