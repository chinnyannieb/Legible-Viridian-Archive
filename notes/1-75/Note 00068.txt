My humble topic is that ancient curse, humanity's most basic task: housekeeping.    First, let's try to get the technological big picture, and then we'll get into some practical, everyday implications.     I'll use myself and my own life as a cogent example here.  I think I'm rather typical of most SIGCHI attendees in that I now have two classes of possessions:  actual possessions, and virtual possessions.  Over the last twenty years, I've gotten my hot little hands on much more of both classes, but mostly, an explosive increase in the second class, virtual stuff.  I own  a hell of a lot of virtual stuff now.  A Guatemalan family of four could live an upwardly mobile life on the revenue I spend on data flows.  Especially if you count my cable TV, phone bills, Internet hookup, software, modems, PCs and the household security system.    So, if there's a difference between my two classes of possessions, it isn't the money involved.  No, the truly remarkable thing about  my virtual stuff is its anomalous relationship to property law.  Is it my property, or isn't it my property?  Who knows?  I sure don't know.  I've got virtual stuff that is freeware, it's shareware, it's cut-and-pasted from heaven knows where. It's personal, it's public,  I made some of it myself,  and every flavor of so on.   Even the stuff I bought direct from Steve Jobs and Bill Gates doesn't actually belong to me.  It came almost mummified in complicated shrinkwrap declarations, so even though I paid real money, carried the box home, and installed the contents myself, I don't actually own this stuff.  I kind of license it, or rent it, apparently.     The Software Publishers Association says that I'm to regard this purchased virtual property as something like a chair.  I'm supposed to believe that software is a physical, sacred property that will stay in one place and under one legal identity, forever.  Or until release 2.0, whichever comes first.  Even though, for instance, I used Netscape for years, when it was college freeware, and then a booming corporation, and then open-source code, and then a division of AOL, and then, probably, nothing at all but a memory, except that I'll still be using Netscape, because I'm really lazy.    Here's my pitch in a nutshell:  I can't imagine virtual property becoming anything much like a chair.  Butt I can easily imagine chairs becoming much, much more like virtual property.   This idea is probably best filed under the grand conceptual heading of "tangible cyberspace," i.e., the process in which the products, programs, and innate nature of virtuality spill out of the computer screen and infect the physical world.     People used to talk about "wiring the home."  This is old-fashioned rhetoric now. Turn the term inside out, and it becomes "sheltering your network." It all becomes clear if you postulate that the net always comes first.  My physical possessions are an aspect of the net.     Today, right now, if you objectively compare my virtual possessions to my actual possessions, it rapidly becomes obvious that my actual possessions are violently out of control.  I have all kinds of searching and cataloging devices and services for my desktop machine, and for the Internet.  But I've been known to hunt for my socks or my car keys for almost an hour.     My house is an awful mess, because my actual possessions are very stupid.  They don't know what they are, they don't know where they are, and they don't know where they belong.     All this could change with a small, cheap, network peripheral which is, I believe, just barely over the technical horizon. The device I imagine is very similar to a common antitheft device, but much smarter.  We could call it a "tab," or a "localizer," or a "locator ID tag."    I imagine this locator ID tag having about a hundred k of memory and costing about ten cents.   It probably runs on household temperature fluctuations.   Its primary activity is to emit a unique radio chirp every two seconds or so.  This chirp is triangulated by a network of receivers in my house and my lawn.  Basically, the chip says, "I'm what I am, and here's where I am," in other words, "I am Bruce Sterling's left cowboy boot, and here I am under the couch where the cat dragged me."       Fine, you think:  you're tagging everything you own, how anal and geeky of you.  No, that's not how this works.  I'm way too lazy to work that hard.  Instead, I pay a professional interior designer to come in and tag everything for me.  I pay this guy (most likely she's a very smart woman actually), to catalog and tag everything I own, and put it where it sensibly belongs == and record that data, and embed it in my system for me.    Now I know nothing, but  my house knows where all my stuff is.  My possessions know what they are, and where they belong.  Unskilled labor can enter my home, and restore everything to perfect order in maybe an hour.       And of course no one can steal any of it, because it's all security tagged, automatically.    Everything I own is a police sting.  These tags are really small, you see?  The size of a fingernail paring, and tougher than a tenpenny nail.  Cops always say to put an ID on your bicycle, but everything I own has a very smart, active ID.        You might think that I find it kind of distasteful to have strangers going through all my stuff.  Sure, there are some things I worry about, like my bong, my vibrator, and my ball-gag, but most of this nervous anxiety about the safety of my possessions is just ingrained habit.   If I always know where it is, and I can never lose it,  and it answers whenever I call for it, then it just surrounds me in an undistinguished haze of cyberstuff. I don't worry about it any more than I worry about the exact location of the segments on my hard drive.    I never have to remember where I put anything again.   "Things are in the saddle, and ride mankind," as Ralph Waldo Emerson used to say, but in this case, I am triumphantly clearing the processing space in my own head of literally thousands of unconscious catalogs.  How many scissors do I have, how many staplers do I have?  I never really use more than one at a time.    My materialist obsession becomes a de-materialist obsession.  There's just as much money around as there ever was, I accomplish everything I did before, but there's a lot less junk underfoot.  Less mass == more data!    It sounds like heaven, doesn't it?O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=OTHIS EMAIL MOVED STICKY BLACK FILTH FROM THE BOWELSOF THE EARTH, AND SET IT ON FIRE IN YOUR AIRO=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O
