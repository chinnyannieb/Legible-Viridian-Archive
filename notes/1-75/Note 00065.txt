Subject: Viridian Note 00065: Burning Man FestivalKey concepts:  Burning Man, Viridian public eventsAttention Conservation Notice:  It's about a bizarre festival which is held every year in a godforsaken dry lake in the middle of the Nevada desert, USA.  Up to ten thousand people go, and there's no water, no electricity, it's hard to get to, and the route there is rather dangerous.Links: http://www.dnai.com/~catnhat/ http://www.well.com/conf/mirrorshades/http://www.bespoke.org/viridianEntries in the Viridian Power Banner Contest:http://www.ugrad.cs.jhu.edu/~rmharman/img/viridian/warn.fossil.gifhttp://www.subterrane.comhttp://www.netaxs.com/~morgana(note dino animation at bottom of page)http://www.phuq.com/viridianhttp://www.freeyellow.com/members6/vandewater/banner.gifhttp://humlog.homestead.com/viridianart/index.htmlhttp://www.powerbase-alpha.com/bigmike/banner.htmlhttp://www.stewarts.org/users/stewarts/sunservr.htmlhttp://www.dux.ru/digbody/viridian/vir.htmhttp://members.aol.com/stjude/viridianhttp://www.id.iit.edu/~chad/viridian/viridian_banner.htmhttp://www.dnai.com/~catnhat/viridianbanners.htmThis contest expires May 31, 01999From: catnhat@dnai.com^^^^^****?  (Cassandra Thomas)Bruce,Would it be off-base to consider having a Viridian camp at Burning Man? I think it would be a great place for a "meme show" and we could sell some of our T-shirts and other products, assuming we have some by Labor Day.Other ideas for Burning Man:* we could trade very hip Viridian merchandise for services to our camp* we could hold Viridian performances and happenings* we could publicize our design principles* we could hold Viridian roundtables where people exchange ideas with usI volunteer to register the camp and help with the organizing if you think it is a good idea. It would also be a time where Viridian people could get together and see each other face to face.Cassandra Thomashttp://www.dnai.com/~catnhat/***Partly Powered by Cleen n' Green energy***http://www.go-green.com/(((bruces remarks:  It's an interesting proposal, so let's "look at the underside first," shall we?  Given the usual standard of public behavior at Burning Man, I hardly see how this could do us any harm.  The worst you could do at Burning Man is die of thirst, set fire to yourself, freak out on drugs or get run over by some kind of large truck.  And, on the positive side, it could be a lot of fun.  I'm not going, because hey, I've been there and I wrote about for WIRED.  So I hereby appoint the aptly-named Cassandra "Viridian High Priestess of Burning Man 01999."  If you feel a burning need to get way-out-there and dominate the playa, get in touch with her.)))O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=OREMEMBER OKLAHOMA CITYO=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O
