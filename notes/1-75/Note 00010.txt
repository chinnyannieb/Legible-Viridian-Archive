These people could be anybody, even you.From: jon@lasser.org (J. Lasser)I was just picking up another computer book (*The Perl Cookbook* from O'Reilly and Associates, written by Tom Christiansen and Nathan Torkington).  Imagine my surprise when I read Larry Wall's introduction:"Cooking is also one of the oldest of the arts. Some modern artists would have you believe that so-called ephemeral art is a recent invention, but cooking has always been an ephemeral art. We can try to preserve our art, make it last a little longer, but even the food we bury with our pharoahs gets dug up eventually." (p. xxi)   This fulfills (literally!) the "Eat What You Kill" dictum, the "embrace of decay" (what else would blue cheese be?), "Planned Evanescence", and "Viridian Inactivism."    Depending on tastes, cooking can also be compatible with the following Viridian principles: "The Future Is History," "History Accumulates," "Look at the Underside First" (look at the growth of organic foods for a cautionary tale), "Design for the Old," "Superstition Isn't Inspiration," "Do Less With Less," "There's No One So Green as the Dead," "Make the Invisible Visible," "Less Mass, More Data" (try nouvelle cuisine), "Seek the Biomorphic and the Transorganic," and "Datamine Nature."   Cooking is not clearly incompatible with any thus-far stated Viridian principle. Of course, it's not hard to imagine an anti-Viridian meal == for example, a steak raised in a burned-over rainforest.From: weasel@gothic.net (Darren Mckeeman)If you're going to have a movement, it's not going to do to have your URL on someone else's server. We need our own domain name to go with the Viridian image. Based on my own experiences, I'll go so far as to suggest a 'presence' package:1) A domain name (www.viridian.org)2) An image package (I can't help you there -- I'm all thumbs)3) a propaganda campaign to get 'Viridian' into the public eye4) a document storage method (otherwise known as designing a useful website).     The first two items are easy. First, find a graphic designer.  You can trip over them in doorways here in San Francisco. Then you get someone to donate web space. This, too, is easy here in San Francisco.     The second half of my list will take some work and a small investment -- maybe $20 per flunkey. Yes, it takes volunteers to properly lead a propaganda campaign.  The Viridian Movement needs some memetic form of propaganda, such as peel-off stickers. I suggest brilliant neon-green stickers with our web address.  We can send a roll to each person on this list for them to start plastering bus stops, cars, bathroom stalls, garbage cans, personal computers, street signs, etc.  Human beings love to deface property -- let's give in to our own inner nature!     Of course, this might appeal more to kids than to old people. From: richardd@reeseco.com (Richard Dorsett)Viridian Publishing:  I believe one of the most important things we should strive to change is the nature of publishing.  Whole forests die so the lumpenproletariat  can read about Rosie O'Donnell's new diet. The notion of chopping down trees to produce romance novels, wrestling magazines and tabloid newspapers is especially repugnant.    This idea is, of course, openly elitist. I propose a ban on the use of physical paper to produce any document that does not meet the strict aesthetic standards of the Viridian Council. Of course, I realize that our sublime edicts will have no authority whatsoever in the "real" world, but by issuing press releases (on-line, of course), and calling into play "reputation economics," we can focus painful attention on publications that are absolute wastes of paper.    As the Viridian Greens gain respect for our many fresh ideas and futurist design scenarios, people will heed our edicts. "Books" will once again become precious art objects, designed to appeal to the eye, the hand, and the mind. Magazines, perhaps printed on pure hemp rag paper, will once again become things of beauty, following the lead of the artists and designers of the Belle Epoque.     We can start by creating an award to give to publishers outstanding in their greed and bad taste. I suggest a fine parchment with a photograph of the Tunguska blast site or Mount St. Helens, showing disaster areas with trees laid flat for miles, with a legend such as "For Outstanding Achievement In The Area Of Deforestation."     We could also reward publishers who design and print lovely, worthwhile publications on a stock of older, preferably hand-made paper. Soon, our awards will be either feared or highly coveted.From: rsewell@cix.compulink.co.uk (Richard Sewell)There's a common idea in these principles :"Eat What You Kill""Avoid the Timeless, Embrace Decay""Planned Evanescence""Look at the Underside First""Design For Evil""Design for the Old"They're all facets of designing for the whole effect of a thing on the world, over all its users and all its lifespan. This suggests a host of similar questions. What better but late-developing design might be stillborn if this one is successful? What developments will this design inspire in a few years? Will this design encourage monopoly or competition? How will it change once it has become successful and moved downmarket?    How do Viridian principles rub along with the economic imperatives that seem to give industrial design its lack of foresight?  Are we just trying to shame them into doing it better ?     Thinking about the artifacts I use and love the best, many of them (my favourite coat, my sewing machine, my bed, my lathe, my chair) are decades old. They work well and last a long time, far beyond original market requirements.  They are Viridian exemplars in that they've generated a lot of utility from a little bit of resource.  They've avoided leaving useless components behind by not becoming irreparable or obsolete (yet). They are all targeted at long-term needs.From: LangiG@parl.gc.ca (Greg Langille)Hi Bruce.  Fab list of principles.As far as requests for candidates, a few obvious ones occur in the power-generating industry.  Perhaps a scale could be used, eg.:0 - 10 where 0 is the perfect Viridian object.1 - wooden water turbines5 - solar panels ( what do you do with the hardware when it breaks?)10 - nuclear powerPerhaps a formula could be used:Viridian Quotient = (time in use) / ((time to create) + (time until 100% decomposition))This would give a "working life" figure.  A broom made of sticks would have a higher figure than the Nuclear Plant, but lower than a song performed live by a band.From: rinesi@espacio.com.ar (Marcelo Rinesi) Concerning the handling of flood disasters, by a member of a flood-ridden society (Argentina).    I live in a city in the shore of the Paran'a River, in South America, which is a zone frequently flooded. Based on what I've seen, I believe that society simply gets used to floods. After a time, floods become part of the landscape, like corrupt politicians.  Long term solutions aren't pressed for. Humans just adapt.    I infer that natural disasters alone won't generate much political pressure to change policy. We will have to factor something else.     Societies long-exposed to certain disaster tend to be aware of its signals.  In my city's case, the river's level makes headlines often.  We should speed the creation of the awareness for those disasters, to make society more efficient on dealing with them.  Education on climatology and individual access to large, global, disaster-prediction systems should be made available.  This might be a necessary step toward finding the will to prevent or solve disasters.     A BBS-like system to post notices of natural disasters could be implemented almost overnight.  Warnings would be issued by research scientists, and the post-fact assessment and help could be issued directly from field experts, especially those in other countries. That system would be  "very Viridian," as it would work almost biologically, like a nervous system for the planet.     A nervous system seems to be very needed now, as so far we only have some sort of "brain" (the Net). Widespread, low-level, sensory, global nervous systems aren't available or working yet, and maybe one of the goals or means of the Viridian movement should be to implement them.    Our material possessions can't be moved from the path of disaster overnight (I sadly learned this by my own experience), so they are particularly disaster-exposed.  A less materially-based culture, which the Viridian movement wants, will paradoxically ease some of the effects of natural disasters, making them less fearful and urgent.    A highly data-based culture might be ideal for an environmentally stricken planet.  It should be part of our contingency plans in case of failure.  (We are going to have contingency plans, aren't we?)From: jim@smallworks.com (Jim Thompson)     You should do something on 'fuel cells'.  The (fairly new) Proton Exchange  Membrane (PEM) cells hold huge promise for cheap, clean, safe energy (and lots of it) from renewable sources.     Basically, a fuel cell is like a battery where you put in some low-grade  hydrocarbon (ethanol, methanol, kerosene, LP Gas, Natural Gas, diesel,  methane). You get DC power out, with pure water and heat as the by-products.     The huge advantage to the PEM-based cells is that they run cool (50C-120C, .versus up to 1800C for other types) and they don't need hard-to-handle catalysts inside.     Several companies are getting commercial-grade PEM-based fuel cells ready for  deployment around 2000. Personally, as soon as they're available, I'm taking my home off the grid.   PEM technology is very Viridian, since it is cute, sexy and glamorous.There are photos at:http://www.gate.net/~h2_ep/10kw_pem.htmA 10 kilowatt stack of cells with a volume of 37 liters (less than 2 cubic feet) weighs 65kg (about 140lbs).Get 5-6 of those going, and you can replace the 220V/200amp service to your home.  Practice a little conservation, and you can get by with far less.     Plug Power (http://www.plugpower.com/) is one of the companies attempting to make a product for the consumer market.*******************************************************Bruce Sterling remarks:  Thank you for your generous help, both in this public posting and behind the Viridian scenes.
