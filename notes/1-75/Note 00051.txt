There would be a driver who steers, changes gears, and brakes.  Music, perhaps, to inspire the pedal/passengers, maybe made from bamboo partially. All passengers ride/pedal for free, of course. Electric kicks in, when there are not enough pedal/riders.Every city could have such a bus to bring attention to people to aid in soliciting low-tech, homemade style ideas for self-sustainability, thinking in terms of small neighborhoods, in mutual co-operation with each other, as a way to really kick off community contingency preparation, globally.  This needs to be done very quickly. So please heed, if you hear the call.  bagelhole1@aol.com(((bruces remarks:  I rather like this nutty, innocent scheme, as long as we can make sure that these giant urban rickshaws are restricted to highly-developed countries, and powered exclusively by rich, well-educated, overweight people.)))From: cascio@well.com^^  (Jamais Cascio)Subject:  Weather Violence TerminologyFrom the Rachel (rachel.org) newsletter #634:"We favor the idea, floated early last year, to stop naming hurricanes after individual humans and start naming them after oil companies. In place of Hurricane Alice or Hurricane Hugo, we would have Hurricane Mobil and Hurricane Exxon. A headline like 'Exxon Kills 10,000, Leaves 50,000 Homeless' would have a certain salutary ring of truth to it."(((bruces remarks:  Yes, of course, but....  "Shell" would get off lightly due to the alphabetical listings, while the new "Amoco/British Petroleum" hybrid would catch more than its fair share of abuse.)))From wex@media.mit.edu^^^^^^^^^** (Dr. Alan Wexelblat)Subject:  Wind-Up Browsers for Ten DollarsThese people don't know it, but they are Viridian...To: mas-students@media.mit.eduFrom: Joe Jacobson <jacobson@media.mit.edu>Subject: Windup Browsers SeminarSeminar - MAS 968 (H level)Fridays 10-12, E15-468HDesign of Information Appliances for the Third World:Windup Browsers        The WIND-UP Browser seminar will be geared towards designing and building an information appliance for developing nations.  The sole constraints are that 1] It must change the world 2] It must have a manufacturing cost of $10.Week 1: Introduction to the ProblemAssignment: Map of literacy and access to information around the globeWeek 2: Introduction to low cost information technologies  Full survey of everything in existence from displays to radio receivers to hand-crank generators that could be cobbled together to make a $10 device.Week 3: In class design session of self contained readerWeek 4: presentation of self contained reader.Week 5: Economic models - how can third world peoples supplement their income:  Contract programming, inventing etc. over the web.Week 6: In class design and presentation of an economic model for supplemental income.  Brainstorm on how to build 1 Billion wind-up browsers.Week 7: In class design of linked information deviceWeek 8: Presentation of linked information deviceWeek 9: Final project.(((bruces remarks:  Here's another  stirring step-forward for the philosophy that wants every Saharan Tuareg to carry his own solar-powered satdish and boombox.  A ten-dollar browser will change the world, all right == it'll change the world to a place that will gladly pay ten *million* dollars for any device that will *eliminate* web browsers, in say, a five-mile radius.)))From:  pdo@metamajik.com^* (Paul D.

NT at least pretends (and pretends is the operative word here) to be a mission-critical OS, where Windows 95 certainly has no place anywhere that lives are on the line.  Later,  Paul.(((bruces remarks:  I should cure myself of this freewheeling poetic license when I know that there are programmers reading this list.  Okay, I formally retract that sad blunder:  "the poor wretches even have to run their various weapons platforms on a mission-critical OS mix of UNIX and Windows NT"....)))***********************Table of Contents 25-50***********************Viridian Notes00026:  Viridian Aphorisms00027:  Viridian Graphics00028:  Viridian Gardening00029:  The Interfund00030:  The View From Ecotopia00031:  Self-destructive Jungles00032:  The Viridian Refueling Project00033:  Viridian Aesthetics: Andy Goldsworthy00034:  Researching Andy Goldsworthy00035:  Viridian Aesthetics:  Landscape Transformation00036:  Offshore Wind Power00037:  Viridian Commentary00038:  Viridian Aphorisms00039:  Starck's New Catalog00040:  German Politics00041:  The Viridian Product Catalog00042:  the Viridian Alcohol Cellphone00043:  the Viridian Electrical Meter00044:  The Viridian Service Station00045:  Twentieth-century Thinking00046:  German Bankers Love German Greens00047:  Viridian Imaginary Products Exhibition00048:  Viridian Aphorisms00049:  Submerging Carbon00050:  Wired Urban Forests*****************PARTY INVITATION.  *****************In totally informal conjunction with  the annual South By SouthWest Multimedia Festival, my wife  Nancy and I are throwing another Open House Party on the  evening of March 16th, Tuesday, starting, say, 7:30 pm or  so.  If you're on the Viridian List, please consider this  your formal invitation to attend.  Bring anybody you  trust.  There will be cold beer.   And  (even more  astonishing and provocative) there will be cigarettes.If you've never been to my house before  (once memorably described by TIME magazine as "the leafy tranquillity of Sterling's well-appointed Austin, Texas home"), send email and I'll ship you the directions and a phone number.Mind you, the SXSW Multimedia Party we threw last time was not half shabby.  These digital-arts people are   definitely a self-starting crowd.  No Charades or Twister was required to break the ice, and a good time was had by all.Bruce Sterling (bruces@well.com)
