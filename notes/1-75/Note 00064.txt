Maybe too many. Membership in the Curia will be closed until further notice.   As their first creative effort, these Curia people are going to create some souvenir Viridian swag which can be given away or sold.  In order to do this, they require some capital, and this note is about generating some money for their operations.   Thanks to the good offices of Jon Lebkowsky (jonl@well.com^^^^^^^^^), I have been running a mail-order bookstore out of my website for a couple of months now.  We are linked to amazon.com, and the myrmidons of Bezos do all our shipping and ordering work while giving us a 5 percent referral fee.       Lebkowsky and I just got out first amazon royalty check.  It's fifty bucks, which is about enough to order a couple of jumbo pizzas and a bottle of decent Chianti.  I don't know what Lebkowsky's doing with his share of the money == he's the one doing all the website work, so heaven knows he deserves it == but I am putting all of my bookstore loot straight into the Viridian Treasury.    I'm not under the illusion that this teensy virtual bookstore is going to generate enough money to get us anywhere important.  There are three things about it that strongly appeal to me, however.(1) The first is that it doesn't require much attention. Except from Lebkowsky, that is.(2)  The second is that, as a byproduct, it allows Viridian people a fine opportunity to create and accumulate a useful Viridian library on relevant subjects such as climate change, postindustrial design, and propaganda graphics. (I don't think these subjects have ever been grouped in one place before, but it's high time.) (3) The third cool thing is that the whole thing is basically being underwritten by the frantic day-trading lunatics who have driven the "value" of Amazon.com out of the stratosphere.  These people are *definitely* the target demographic group of marks and suckers who should be painlessly tapped for some cash so that we Viridians can enjoy ourselves.    On http://www.well.com/conf/mirrorshades/ I have a little Viridian library going already, but I want to expand it radically.  Therefore, I want you, the experienced and canny Viridian list reader, to tell me about the high-quality, relevant books that you are convinced other Viridians should be reading.       I don't want you to disgorge some dry bibliography of all possible reference works -- don't bug me with this.  I am an author, I know very well that the world is chock-full of boring books.  You *have to blurb them for us,* so that we can have some assurance that we are not wasting our valuable attention on your pet obsession with left-handed Croatian land snails.   I want to know about books that are of vital Viridian interest, so that Viridians can come by the site, buy some book, receive it, enjoy it, get some real benefit out of it, and then come back and cheerfully buy another one.      Note that I am not begging you to give us any money.  What I'm begging for here is some intelligent attention and some critical assessment.  Thanks to Bezos et al, we now have a method by which we can turn this critical practice into money.  This money will be spent on Viridiana, so at length, and theoretically, it ought to benefit you.     I make one exception to this policy of high quality. If you are on Viridian list and you yourself write books, I will put your books up on the site even if they are dull, irrelevant and stupid.  After all, my own books are up there, too.  Many of them are not in the least Viridian.  If you're on this list, I'm kind of interested in knowing what you write. So, tell me about your own books.  You'll get the usual royalties if we sell any, while the group will get the referral fee.     I also inherited some books quite recently.  They have nothing to do with Viridian matters, but the stacks of dusty books here are literally driving me out of the Viridian Vatican.  I believe I will sell the surplus off, perhaps in the new amazon.com bidding system, and add these book salvage funds to the Viridian Treasury.      And after all that, I dunno.  Maybe a for-profit blood drive.0=o=0 0=o=0 0=o=0 0=o=0 0=o=0 0=o=0 0=o=0 0=o=0MY EMAIL BURNS OIL AND DAMAGES YOUR CLIMATE 0=o=0 0=o=0 0=o=0 0=o=0 0=o=0 0=o=0 0=o=0 0=o=0
