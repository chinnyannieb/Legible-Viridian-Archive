Subject:  Viridian Note 00013:  Link CriticismKey concepts:  Web links, link criticism, automoderating groupwareAttention Conservation Notice:  Although it is rather long, this Note may save some of your attention if you were bravely preparing to examine the long list of links in yesterday's Note 00012. Links:  http://www.bespoke.org/viridian/http://www.thehub.com.au/~mitch/V-Notes/ViridianIndex.htmlhttp://www.well.com/conf/mirrorshades/links.htmlhttp://www.spring.net/yapp-bin/public/read/cultures/18Entries in the "Big Mike" Viridian Design Contest:http://www.pinknoiz.com/graphics/bigmike.gifFrom: steffen@eskimo.com^* (Alex Steffen)Re: Viridian Note 00012Bruce--        I took a quick stroll through the links you sent, and while many of them are of potential interest, I would personally find it much more useful if links were used to provide material to fuel conversations directly.  For instance:  "Check out this OECD site.  They're doing amazing things with taxes and resource pricing.  Is there a way in which Viridian design could influence the way people think about taxes (on the principle of  'Make the Invisible Visible')?"   Then I could know better how (or if) I wanted to absorb this link into my info flow, which is already eating away at the thin levees of organization I've built to contain it.     "No Info-Dumping" should be a Viridian principle. Let's have less information, elegant information, useful information, passionate information... not just more of it. I'd rather get a haiku than a dissertation any day.(((bruces remarks:  I couldn't agree with you more, Alex, but who exactly is supposed to be "mining the haikus" out of all those info-dumps?  Meaning and passion are not invisible goods.  Your info-levees  merely export yourflood of data downstream to the rest of us.)))From: SeJ@aol.com^^* (Stefan Jones)It might be of benefit to give links various Viridian ratings:Import (5 - Astounding, of immense interest; 0 - Not worthless, but certainly not a priority).For instance, a RealTime archive of Rush Limbaugh, shaken by news of Honduran disaster, losing it and turning into a Green on-air, would rate a 5.  Technical reports on a fuel cell, when other more accessible articles have already been listed, might rate a 1 or 0.Timeliness (5 - Ephemeral, read IMMEDIATELY, 0 - Will be there forever)For instance, http://www.newscientist.com/nsplus/insight/global/global.htmlis a series of daily entries about the Buenos Aires global warming conference.  It's rated a 4 because it will be around only a week or so.Aproposity (5 - Dead-on related to Viridian interests, 2 - Tangentially related, 0 - No direct relation to Viridianism)For instancehttp://slashdot.orgrates a 0; it's a great site, but not apropos. On the other hand, if slashdot.org ran an article on mailing list "automoderating groupware," you might mention it in a Viridian post.Commercial intent (5 - It's an unabashed plug, and perhaps suspect; 4 - It's got a good description of the product, plus a way to buy it; 0 - It's a fair and unbiased review.)Realgood.org might rate 4; old-time Whole Earth Reviews a 2.(((bruces remarks:  this puts a cheering facade of mathematical rigor onto our problem, but we still require invisible munchkins to do our critical assessment work and supply us with passion and meaning.  Viridians can expect to hear a great deal more in future about the concept of "automoderating groupware."  If "automoderating groupware" worked, the Pope-Emperor could put his feet up and save the world by remote control.)))From:  jon@lasser.org^^^** (J Lasser)Re Note 00012:   "Someday it may be useful and constructive to have a list of official Viridian-approved links.  Or will it?"Of course it won't.  Rather than Viridian-approved links, we  need an annotated Viridian bibliography. Consider my friend Ed's site.http://homepage.usr.com/c/critconst/"The Critical Constant" is a weekly  net-based science publication different from most others.  While most of its articles are summaries from _Science_News_ and _Science_, they're written for an intelligent audience which understands scientific concepts and methods, but has no time for the inner workings of the scientific community.  Short, well-written, and with humorous headlines, "The Critical Constant" tells readers what they should know about the world of science.A sample, from issue 12 (archived athttp://www.geocities.com/ResearchTriangle/Thinktank/4942/issue12.html):"Scars on the sky may burn us alive!"Jet airplanes leave contrails, those fluffy mini-clouds of unspeakable smoke and oxidized filth.  These hang in the sky, either until they unite with water droplets and fall, or until they spark the formation of cirrus clouds. Cirrus clouds, for their part, warm the Earth.  A preliminary estimate suggests that 0.1C to 0.3C of the last 30-odd years' warming might be due to these cirrus excesses."To turn to an assessment from your list in Note 00012:http://www.slashdot.com/Slashdot is about as far from a Viridian website as is possible. Youth-oriented and focused almost exclusively on the near-term, Slashdot thinks not of the environment, nor of the ultimate consequences of technology run amok.  Despite this, it's a model example of virtual community's effectiveness as an organizing tool. (This despite the Slashdot community's notorious all-talk no-code nature.)From: whiz@ricochet.net^* (Michael Treece)Review of www.carfree.comYour Pope-Emperorship:I found the Carfree Times at www.carfree.com to be well-researched and well-thought-out.  It deals with the problems of transportation and city living from both a macro (urban planning, use of space) and a micro level (bus scheduling, whether or not to fence in backyards).  It uses European cities as its inspiration, in the main; a bit too much Venice here, though.  Long on solutions, and very light on blame for the current US situation (i.e., it does not take Firestone, General Motors, et al. to task for the takeover and destruction of mass transit in the 1940s).  Many "solutions" do depend on the building of new cities, though adaptation of existing cities is addressed.   Website graphics are clean, spare, and adequate; nothing moves, and no cool effects are noted.  Arrangement facilitates rapid utilization of the site, as the reader is quickly moved from one page to the next.    The bulk of the site, with its attendant information load, can be viewed in under one hour.From:  rsewell@cix.compulink.co.uk^^^** (Richard Sewell) I agree with your comment in Note 00012 - a link serves a useful purpose only if backed up with some substantial content. I see no value in a mere list of links (especially after wading though this lot). In random order, then:> http://www.va.com.au/photobots/PhotoBots.htmFreeware artificial-life app. Neat, but I see no Viridian connection.>http://environment.miningco.com/library/weekly/aa110198.htmFairly detailed overview of the COP-4 climate-change talks in Buenos Aires, November 1988, with plenty of links to official sites.> http://www.sirius.com/~schizo/demo/start.htmArt and  art theory, including some sculpture made of salvage and some theorising about electricity. If the Futurists were Viridian, this guy is too, but not so much, and he's not as interesting.> http://www.loe.org/html/headlines/coffins.htmlNews report about biodegradable coffins. Aren't they all made from wood anyhow? Perhaps this illustrates the banality of environmental bandwagoning.> www.realgoods.comOnline catalogue of stuff in the New Age/Save The Planet camp - hemp scarves, water filters, worm farms, personal sundials. Gimmicky, might contain some worthwhile stuff.> http://www.scientificsales.com/balloons.htmMeteorological balloons for sale.> http://www.fooledya.com/balloon/An introduction to the large and complex world of decorative balloons and balloon-twisting.http://science.nasa.gov/newhome/headlines/msad26oct98_1.htmNASA news story about experimental aerogel manufacture on the US Space Shuttle.  Apparently, aerogels made under gravity are not completely transparent, whereas aerogels made in free fall can be. If transparent aerogels could be made on Earth, they could be used to make insulating windows. Viridian?  Well, it's a neat tech which could be used for energy-saving ends, but it looks like a bit of a boondoggle to me. The world already has Scandinavian triple-glazing, and mostly doesn't bother to use it.> http://www.ad.ic.ac.uk/estates/projects/chp/descrip.htmImperial College in Britain is installing a multi-megawatt CHP (Combined Heat and Power) system.  Some technical detail.> www.carfree.comAt last, some relevance. This is an organisation campaigning for, and planning for, cities without cars. Seems like thoughtful and sensible stuff. If we don't get fusion and electric cars, we'll need something like this on CO2 grounds alone, and we may well need it just to escape gridlock anyhow.(((bruces remarks:  the heroic intellectual labor ofrsewell@cix.compulink.co.uk^^^** speaks for itself!)))
