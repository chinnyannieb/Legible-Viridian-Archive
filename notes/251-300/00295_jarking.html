<P>"Arms have to move in order to be sold.  This movement
can be monitored.  Deals have to be brokered and this
means that information must flow between the interested
parties. Such information flows can also be monitored.
Much of this observation can be accomplished by using the
satellite and other technical capabilities available to
advanced intelligence communities.
</p>

<P>"But there is also an activity that has been
particularly tailored to small arms trafficking and this
culd itself be broadened and deepened in order to gain a
better picture of the movement of light weapons.  This
activity is sometimes called 'jarking' but is more often
termed 'tagging.'  With its origins in the work of the
British Army's Special Weapons Unit in Northern Ireland,
'jarking' has received an important boost through the
possibility of linking micro-miniaturization with
satellite-related technologies.  It could prove to be an
important tool in the gaining of evidence concerning light
weaons trafficking."</P>

<P>(((A footnote indicates that the term "jarking" predates
1992.  And, in Silicon Valley jarking news, there's a
primal stirring in the legendary start-up garage.)))</P>

<P>"<strong>Apple Creator Wozniak Forms Start-Up</strong></P>

<P>"LOS GATOS, Calif. (Reuters) == Steve Wozniak, who helped
usher in the personal computer era when he co-founded
Apple Computer Inc., emerged from semiretirement on
Wednesday with plans to create new wireless devices to
help 'everyday people track everyday things.'
</p>

<P>"Wozniak, who in 1976 created the first Apple computers
with high school friend Steve Jobs, said he has formed a
new company called Wheels of Zeus, or wOz, a play on his
nickname.
</p>

<P>"The computer industry's most famous garage tinkerer
said he believes the time is right to develop a new class
of consumer electronics to take advantage of advances in
satellite tracking, wireless networks and more powerful
computer chips.
</p>

<P>"'Recent advances in global positioning software (GPS)
systems and antenna technology coupled with the declining
cost of processing power and two-way networking make the
possibilities for new devices and services really
exciting,' Wozniak said in a statement.
</p>

<P>"A report in the New York Times on Wednesday said
Wozniak would not immediately announce whatproducts he is
developing. A spokesman for the company was not
immediately available to comment further.
</p>

<P>"The wOz statement suggested more details on the
company would be found at <A HREF="http://www.woz.com">http://www.woz.com</A>. But visitors
to the site were redirected to Wozniak's personal site at
<A HREF="http://www.woz.org">http://www.woz.org</A>, where no details on wOz were
available.
</p>

<P>"Wozniak said wOz had secured $6 million in initial
funding from well-known Silicon Valley venture capitalists
Mobius Venture Capital == the former Softbank Venture
Capital == along with Draper Fisher Jurvetson and Palo
Alto Investors.
</p>

<P>"The Silicon Valley icon, who has shied from public
attention in recent years, helped shape the computing
industry with his design of Apple's first line of
products, including the Apple I and II, and influenced the
popular Macintosh.
</p>

<P>"Wozniak left Apple Computer in the early 1980s to
organize rock festivals and several eccentric 'citizen
detente' ventures between the United States and the former
Soviet Union. For the past decade his public activities
have been mainly as a philanthropist backing art and
science institutions and local Silicon Valley schools.
</p>

<P>"Tim Draper, founder and managing director of Draper
Fisher Jurvetson, will be chairman of the company's newly
formed advisory board, which will include undisclosed 'top
executives and industry innovators.' Draper's firm was the
original backer of Hotmail, the popular free email service
now owned by Microsoft Corp."</P>
