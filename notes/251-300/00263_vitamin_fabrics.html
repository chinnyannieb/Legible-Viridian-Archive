<P>"T-shirt fills vitamin gap</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Why eat when you can wear?</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A Japanese company says people will soon be able to
get their daily dose of Vitamin C simply by wearing a T-
shirt.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Fuji Spinning Company has developed a fibre
containing a chemical called pro-vitamin, which turns into
Vitamin C on contact with human skin. (...)</P>

  <P>"A T-shirt made out of fibre == called V-up == would
have the equivalent vitamin content of two lemons and
remain effective after 30 washes.  (((A triumph for
Japanglish neologisms; "my shirt overdosed me with
vitamins, and that made me 'V-up.'")))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Company spokesman Makoto Suzuki says the product is
aimed at women who are interested in skin care.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lace underwear  (((This is where it gets good.)))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Women can make up their face but they cannot make up
their body,' he told the BBC's East Asia Today programme.
(((Oh come on!  The killer app for clothes that can feed
you isn't rich civilian women who can't buy enough make-
up.  It's obviously <STRONG>starving refugees in camps</STRONG> and <STRONG>the
military on patrol.</STRONG>  Intravenous feed is great for those
who are critically weak, and if these were your BVD's
under one of those chem-proof ninja suits, you'd be living
large.)))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'We are trying to develop other vitamins also.'"
(((How about some Vitamin D?  Then we can avoid scurvy,
even if the Greenhouse deprives us of sunlight for months
on end!)))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The company also produces fibres with anti-odour and
anti-bacterial properties derived from catechin, a
substance extracted from the shells of crabs and shrimp."
(((Draw your own conclusion about the way that underwear
smells.)))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The T-shirts should be on sale early in 2002. There
are also plans for vitamin-enhanced lace underwear."
(((And it's <STRONG>edible</STRONG> underwear!  Am I kidding? You'll
never know.)))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Health experts say the best way to get the required
daily dose of vitamins is to eat a varied and balanced
diet, containing lots of fruit and vegetables."  (((What
hopeless mandarin at the BBC insisted on inserting this
last paragraph?)))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;((((It's a real company, folks. And they really sell
underwear. Get your "Spanfresh" and "Chitopoly" now.)))</P>

<P>"Fuji Spinning Company Limited (...)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The company specializes in developing value-added,
functional textile products such as Spanfresh, a moisture-
absorbing and -releasing elastane yarn used primarily in
underwear. Other products include Chitopoly, an apparel
fiber woven with catechin, a substance extracted from the
shells of crab and shrimp that gives it odor-preventing
and antibacterial properties. Fuji Spinning also produces
and markets BVD-brand undergarments and shirts in Japan
through a licensing agreement with Fruit of the Loom."</P>
