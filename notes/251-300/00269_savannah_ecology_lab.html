<P>"Wildlife finds safe haven on dangerous acres</P>

<P>"By Tom Kenworthy
USA TODAY</P>

<p>"SAVANNAH RIVER SITE, S.C. &#8212;(...)</p>

<p>"For Whit Gibbons, a University of Georgia ecologist, and Cameron Young, a graduate student, it's just another critter-rich day in one of the nation's most unusual outdoor labs.</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The two herpetologists are among dozens of scientists
attached to the Savannah River Ecology Laboratory, a
research facility in the middle of a 300-square-mile
federal property carved out as a nuclear weapons plant
site a half-century ago. For much of the Cold War, the
Savannah River Site, 20 miles southeast of Augusta,
Ga., produced plutonium and tritium for atomic bombs.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As a result, it is one of the most heavily polluted
places on earth.  (((Wildlife thrives in areas humans have
ruined and are too cautious to enter.  See Viridian Notes
00242 on the Berlin wall death strip, Note 00234 on the
Korean Demilitarized Zone, Note 00185 on the Adamello
Glacier, Note 00166 on Chernobyl, and Note 00023 in which we first formulated the "involuntary park" concept.)))<BR>
<BR>
"But in a grand irony, this facility &#8212; along with a<BR>
handful of other large weapons plants in Colorado,<BR>
Washington state, Idaho and Tennessee that were walled<BR>
off from the outside world for decades &#8212; also is a<BR>
treasure-trove of biological diversity.<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<BR>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One unintended benefit of the race to produce weapons
of mass destruction has been the protection of huge
islands of wildlife habitat. With the arms race
largely over, these sites, for all their ghastly
contaminants, are increasingly being recognized as key
refuges for wildlife largely unaffected by the nuclear
and chemical pollution.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ninety percent of the Savannah River site has been
virtually undisturbed for decades. It contains a rich
mix of ecosystems: hardwood and pine forests, Carolina
bay wetlands, cypress-tupelo swamps.
<BR></P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>"The plant and animal life is breathtaking &#8212; and has<BR>
been documented by the Savannah River Ecology<BR>
Laboratory since the early 1950s, with most research<BR>
conducted outside of highly contaminated areas. Here,<BR>
there are more than 240 species of birds, more than<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<P>100 species of reptiles and amphibians, nearly 100
species of freshwater fish. A creek running through
the site has the greatest diversity of invertebrates
of any in the Western Hemisphere.  (((They glow in the dark, but they're there.)))<BR>
<BR>
"The largest alligator ever found in South Carolina &#8212;<BR>
more than 13 feet long &#8212; came from here, and the<BR>
largemouth bass are an angler's dream. These are not<BR>
nuclear mutants, simply specimens grown large because<BR>
they are not hunted or fished.  'It's a pretty simple formula,' Gibbons says. 'The best protection for the
environment is no people.'  (((see Viridian Principle:
There Is No One So Green As the Dead.)))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"What about having all this surrounding a plant
struggling to deal with 35 million gallons of
high-level nuclear waste and a devil's brew of toxic
chemicals? 'It's ironical, it's paradoxical,' he
says."   (((Get used to it.)))</P>
