<P>"Personal power: solar utility in a backpack</P>

<P>(...)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A solar power unit that can be carried in a backpack
was created by a Portland, Oregon, inventor and is already
making its way around the world.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Solar Power Pack contains a folding
monocrystalline solar panel, battery, controller, plugs,
cords and light. It weighs only 24 pounds but provides
users with 120 watt-hours of power a day.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The unit can power AC and DC electronics up to 300
watts. It can be used in recreational vehicles as well as
for field research, emergency home power, disaster relief
and international aid. (((And, for those without enough
cosmetic accessories, it can power a hairdryer.)))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After charging for six hours with the unit's solar
photovoltaic panel, the Solar Power Pack can run a laptop
computer for three hours or its own high-efficiency light
for 14 hours.  (((Very handy after NATO surgical bombing,
or after your Indymedia center has been baton-charged by
angry police.)))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'The Solar Power Pack is a personal solar power
utility designed to be operated and transported by a
single person,' said Toby Kinkaid, founder and CEO of
Solardyne Corporation, a developer and on-line retailer of
renewable energy technology and high efficiency
appliances.  (((Never met him; love him already.)))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An international traveller, Kinkaid came up with the
idea for the solar backpack when he ran out of camera
batteries while exploring Malaysia and the Maldives.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"People in the Maldives, an island nation in the
Indian Ocean, use noisy diesel generators for power, said
Kinkaid. Getting fuel there is difficult, as it is in all
remote areas.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(...) "Kinkaid studied physics in university and has
been running a solar laboratory for 18 years. To reduce
the cost of expensive solar electric cells (...)  his
Mariposa solar module uses reflectors to concentrate twice
the amount of solar energy onto half the number of the
solar cells. (...)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The result is a solar pack that sells for $549. The
solar panel is designed to last 20 years. The battery
lasts for 600 charge cycles, which equals about two years
if the system is used daily. Once spent, the battery can
be replaced and recycled. (...)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Greenpeace ordered units for use in India. Solardyne
has added a converter for Indian power that runs at a
higher voltage than power in the United States. The
package includes a water sterilizer powered by the solar
pack that decontaminates tap water using ultraviolet rays.
(((Yet another post-disaster killer app.)))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'We are particularly excited about the prospect of
humanitarian organizations using the Solar Power Pack for
their relief efforts,' Kinkaid said. 'Imagine the
difference these groups can make in people's lives by
taking a portable source of ready power to Third World
nations.'  (((Or G-8 nations reduced to Third World
status by Wexelblat disasters.)))</P>

<P><BR>
(((What a noble effort. Just one problem though. The power
is generated by a big tourist backpack, not your clothing
itself.)))</P>

"Power dressing<BR>
April 11, 02001</P>

<P>by Duncan Graham-Rowe<BR>

"Your sweater could one day provide all the power you need
to run your MP3 player, mobile phone or palmtop computer
== as long as you're not standing in a darkened room.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The idea comes from scientists in Germany, who have
developed synthetic fibres that generate electricity when
exposed to light. The researchers say the fibres could be
woven into machine-washable clothes to make the ultimate
in portable solar cells.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The discovery may provide a big boost for developers
of wearable computers, who've been plugging their devices
into mini fuel cells or plain old batteries.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A sail made of solar fabric might even be able to
provide power for a boat's electronics, says Martin Rojahn
of the Institute of Physical Electronics at the University
of Stuttgart. (...)  (((The same goes for a solar-fabric
refugee tent.  Are you listening, Burning Man Festival?)))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rojahn, Markus Schubert and Michail Rakhlin
developed their photovoltaic fibres while trying to
deposit amorphous silicon on curved surfaces. They found
that by depositing different layers around a fibre, they
could build up the photovoltaic sandwich in cylindrical
form.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Any substrate that looks like a cylinder, from
wires to fibre-optic cables, will work,' says Rojahn ==
provided it can withstand the ultraviolet radiation and
100&deg;C temperatures used in the deposition process.  (((You
don't want this done to your clothing as you're wearing
it.)))</P>

<P>"Power lead</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One of the biggest challenges facing the German team
is creating contacts with each strand in a fabric, says
Chris Chapman, development director of ElectroTextiles in
Buckinghamshire == a company which specialises in making
electronic devices out of fabric. 'The thing that scuppers
most things with fabrics is getting power in and out of
it,' he says.  (((Especially when your sailboat has been
scuppered, and its solar sails are shorting-out in
seawater.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(...) "As far as fashion sense is concerned, colour
shouldn't be a problem, explains Rojahn. Although the
fibre is transparent, it can be made to take on different
colours by adjusting the thickness of a transparent
protective coating. (((Changing color in real-time?
Maybe that's too  much to ask, but if it takes power,
at least you've got a  source.)))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Depending upon the thickness of the layer, it could
be made to look blue, brown or greenish,' he says.
(((Military earth-colors.)))</P>
