<P>"UPDATE - Key climate change talks start in Morocco</P>

<P>MOROCCO: October 30, 2001</P>

<P>"MARRAKESH, Morocco == U.N. talks to seal an unprecedented
climate change treaty got under way in Marrakesh yesterday
with the world's biggest polluter, the United States,
taking a back seat.
</p>

<P>"The 2,000 delegates from 160 countries have two weeks
to set out in legal detail principles adopted in Bonn in
July on making significant cuts in the next decade in
emissions of the 'greenhouse gases' blamed for raising the
earth's temperature.</P>

<P>(((Okay, imagine you're a delegate from one of these 160
countries (who are not the United States), and you're all
in some big hotel in a Moslem country.  What do you
suppose you want to talk about?)))
</p>

<P>"The treaty, known as the Kyoto Protocol and forged
in 1997 in Japan, must be ratified by a majority of
industrial nations responsible for global warming in order
to take effect.
</p>

<P>"It aims to cut emissions of greenhouses gases by an
average of five percent from 1990 levels by 2012.  (((As
we Viridians have frequently noted, this goal implies
spewing greenhouse gases of the level of about 1988,
forever.)))
</p>

<P>"'In Marrakesh, the focus will be on completing the
translation of the Bonn agreements into legal language,'
Dutch Environment Minister and outgoing conference
chairman Jan Pronk told the opening plenary session.
</p>

<P>"A last-minute political compromise on the main
issues was reached in Bonn three months ago and the
Marrakesh session is expected to produce a legally binding
document.
</p>

<P>"'You can put the icing on the Bonn cake,' Pronk told
delegates, urging them to set aside political differences.
'Don't renegotiate a political agreement already reached,
just work it out,' he said.  ((("And work it out before
you clowns drown my beloved Dutch homeland, large expanses
of which are already subaqueous.")))</P>

<P>"U.S. DELEGATION ON SIDELINES  (((in their flak jackets)))
</p>

<P>"The environmental group Greenpeace sounded a less
optimistic note, saying rules already agreed were so weak
that they were unlikely to lead to a reduction of
greenhouse emissions.
</p>

<P>"'Even the Protocol's nominal target of a five
percent reduction hardly started the process of making the
80 percent reductions needed to prevent dangerous levels
of climate change,' said Bill Hare, Greenpeace climate
policy director.  ((("Hi, I'm Bill Hare of Greenpeace, and
I'll be playing the role of Banquo in William
Shakespeare's immortal 'Macbeth.'")))
</p>

<P>"The Marrakesh conference 'must not be muddled with
diplomatic doubletalk...the processes that underpin the
Protocol must be transparent and open for public
participation,' he added in a communique.  ((("In fact,
it's already so transparent that we've seen through the
whole threadbare charade.")))
</p>

<P>"The United States pulled out of the Kyoto Protocol
in March, calling it flawed and harmful to the U.S.
economy.  (((What's left of it.)))
</p>

<P>"Though represented in Marrakesh, Washington == the
world's biggest industrial power and biggest polluter ==
is not expected to play an active role, delegates said.
This made the support of the 15 European Union countries
and Russia vital to the success of the meeting.   (((Let's
face it, it's high time the lot of 'em ditched that
jittery hyperpower and succeeded at <STRONG>something.</STRONG>)))
</p>

<P>"The treaty will enter into force if ratified by 55
countries responsible for 55 percent of emissions in 1990.
Russia produced about 17 percent of those 11 years ago.
(((When Russia still had an economy.)))
</p>

<P>"So far, 40 nations have ratified the treaty.
</p>

<P>"Michael Zummit Cutajar, executive secretary of the
Climate Change Convention, said there were no obstacles on
major issues.  ((("Because Exxon's not here.")))
</p>

<P>"From Russia 'what's on the table is larger
allowances for the use of sinks,' he told a news
conference.  (((Since the next major Kyoto meeting is in
Russia, they're not real likely to queer that deal.)))
</p>

<P>"'Sinks' is jargon for the forests and farms that
absorb carbon from the earth's atmosphere. The deal allows
Russia, Japan and Canada to use these widely to reach
their goals.  (((Hey wow, somebody noticed Canada.)))</P>

<P><BR>
"PROGRESS MUST CONTINUE
</p>

<P>"Moroccan Environment Minister Mohamed El Yazghi, who
was elected conference chairman, said last months's
suicide attacks on New York and Washington had shocked
everyone, but the U.N. climate talks were a clear answer
to those who thought they could stop human progress.
</p>

<P>"'We don't have the right to fail', Yazghi told
delegates, urging them to avoid raising new demands.
(((That's right == the chairman is a diplomat named
Mohamed  who is talking perfect sense.)))
</p>

<P>"Acknowledging that world attention might be focused
on the U.S.-led strikes on Afghanistan, he said climatic
dangers were not the least of the dangers threatening
mankind, which must act as one family.
</p>


<P>"Organisers also stressed the importance of the
venue, in Africa and in a Muslim country.  (((Kinda hard
to miss, given the circumstances.)))
</p>

<P>"'Widespread poverty, recurrent drought and floods,
and dependence on rainfed agriculture, forestry and
fisheries make this continent and its people most
vulnerable to climate change,' said Zummit Cutajar.
(((It's hard to think of anything that Africa is the
<STRONG>least</STRONG> vulnerable to, except maybe dotcom crashes.)))
</p>

<P>"Security was tight at the first international
conference since the September 11 attacks and all mail
addressed to the conference was being checked for anthrax.
(((There may be some international venue somewhere that's
<STRONG>not</STRONG> being checked for anthrax, but I doubt it.  How
could the attendees tolerate such disrespect?)))
</p>

<P>"The Marrakesh meeting, attended by some 4,000 people
including non-governmental organisations and the press, is
known as COP7, the seventh conference of the parties to a
U.N. treaty signed in 1992 at the first Earth Summit in
Rio de Janeiro."</P>

<P>(((Next, a handy chronology of just how little the New
World Order has accomplished politically in the past ten
years.)))</P>

<P>"REUTERS NEWS SERVICE</P>

<P>"UK: October 29, 2001</P>

<P>"LONDON - U.N. climate talks on a pact to limit global
warming resume today with the world's main polluter, the
United States, on the sidelines. (...)  ((("Sidelines,"
"backseat," it just can't be repeated too often.)))</P>

<P>"Here is a chronology of some of the major political
events since the Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro in 1992.</P>

<P>"1992:</P>

<P>"June == World leaders end their Earth Summit in Rio de
Janeiro pledging to do their utmost to prevent
environmental ruin and alleviate poverty.
</p>

<P>"The main achievement of the Earth Summit is a treaty
to reduce emissions of 'greenhouse gases' which help trap
heat in the atmosphere and are believed to be a cause of
global warming.
</p>

<P>"Nations adopt 1990 as the benchmark year at the
summit in which industrialised countries agree to take
voluntary steps to cut emissions to that year's levels.
Most countries, other than Germany and Great Britain, have
failed to meet that goal.  (((And hey, Russia.)))
</p>

<P>"Sep 30 - The U.S. space agency reports that the
'ozone hole' over Antarctica grew 15 percent in 1992 and
is now nearly the size of the entire North American
continent. The Antarctic ozone hole, first spotted in
1985, is caused by the depletion of the Earth-shielding
ozone layer which is eroded by human-made chemicals such
as chlorofluorocarbons, known as CFCs.</P>

<P>"1993:</P>

<P>"May 20 == U.S. scientists report that they have invented
a computer model for predicting the effects of global
warming on crops and forests. They find that the growth
rate of plants is affected by the amount of carbon dioxide
in the air, by nitrogen in soil and by temperature and
moisture changes caused by global warming.</P>

<P>"Oct 20 == U.S. President Bill Clinton announces an
ambitious plan to combat global warming. Under the plan,
U.S. greenhouse gas emissions would be cut to 1990 levels
by 2000 through over 50 initiatives affecting all sectors
of the economy.  ((("Over everybody else's dead body,'
stoutly declares Global Climate Coalition as they hire
hordes of spin doctors.)))</P>

<P>"1994:</P>

<P>"June 1 - The international environmental group,
Greenpeace announces in a report entitled 'The Climate
Timebomb', that global warming is causing severe climatic
changes and environmental disasters around the world.</P>

<P>"1995:</P>

<P>"Feb 3 - Only slight global warming has occurred in the
last 100 years and there is no sign of it producing more
hurricanes, tornadoes or other extreme climate changes,
Accu-Weather Inc. says in a report for the Global Climate
Coalition, a business trade association seeking a voice in
scientific research.  ((("Seeking a voice;" deftly
stifling dozens of others.)))</P>

<P>"1996:</P>

<P>"Feb 20 - Environment ministers from the world's leading
economic powers agree that developing and industrial
nations alike must do more to battle global warming and
chemicals that deplete the ozone layer after a two-day
meeting of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development environment ministers in Paris.</P>

<P>"Jul 18 - A pledge by major industrial powers to fight
global warming by reducing greenhouse gas emissions from
oil and coal wins wide support and is put into the
official record at a United Nations Conference on Climate
Change in Geneva.</P>

<P>"1997:</P>

<P>"Dec 11 - The world's first treaty to reduce greenhouse
gases finally emerges after marathon talks in Kyoto,
Japan. Under the Kyoto agreement, industrial nations are
committed to reducing their greenhouse gas emissions by
5.2 percent from 1990 levels by 2008-12.</P>

<P>"1998:</P>

<P>"November - Around 170 nations gather at the United
Nations global warming conference in Buenos Aires to
discuss ways of cutting emissions of greenhouse gases by
2008-2012.</P>

<P>"Specialists from the U.S. and Canada tell the summit that
global warming is killing the world's coral reefs, and
with them the swarming sea life they shelter and support.</P>

<P>"1999:</P>

<P>"Nov 4 - Environment ministers from 173 countries meeting
in Bonn end talks without any breakthroughs and with many
difficult issues remaining unresolved. One involves the
penalties payable if nations do not meet their pollution
targets. Another is the extent to which nations will be
able to pay others to reduce pollution on their behalf.</P>

<P>"2000:</P>

<P>"Apr 9 - Environment ministers of the G8 nations end talks
calling for the early ratification of a global warming
accord but paper over other differences on cutting
greenhouse gases.</P>

<P>"Sep 8 - Scientists from the U.S. space agency NASA report
the largest ozone hole ever observed has opened up over
Antarctica, a sign that ozone-depleting gases churned out
years ago are just now taking their greatest toll.</P>

<P>"Nov 25 - A two-week U.N. climate conference ends in
failure in The Hague after a bitter dispute between the EU
and the U.S. over how to curb greenhouse gas emissions.</P>

<P>"2001:</P>

<P>"Mar 28 - The U.S. abandons the 1997 Kyoto treaty on
global warming. President George W. Bush opposes the
treaty, saying it is against U.S. economic interests.</P>

<P>"Apr 26 - The Council of Europe's parliamentary assembly
slams the U.S. decision, saying it casts doubt on
Washington's reliability as a global partner.</P>


<P>"July 23 - Environment ministers meeting in Germany, reach
a last-minute compromise deal to salvage the Kyoto accord
on cutting greenhouse gas emissions, despite the
withdrawal of the U.S. from negotiations this year.</P>

<P>"Aug 1 - Klaus Toepfer, head of the U.N. Environment
Program, says the international pact struck in Bonn will
serve as an important base for future agreements but will
not reduce toxic gas emissions by the targeted amounts.</P>

<P>"Oct 23 - The E.U. presents a package of measures on
climate change, decisive to enable the Union to respect
its undertakings under the Kyoto Protocol. The measures
include a draft Directive on a greenhouse gas emissions
trading system within the EU</P>

<P>"'Climate saviour' EU calls world to ratify Kyoto</P>

<P>EU: October 29, 2001</P>

<P>"BRUSSELS - There will be no excuse for countries delaying
implementation of a four-year old pact on global warming
once the rules are finalised in the next two weeks, the
head of the European Union delegation said last week.</P>

<P>"The 15-country European Union has styled itself as the
saviour of the Kyoto Protocol on cutting greenhouse gases
which the United States pulled out of in March. But the EU
needs the support of most other industrialised countries
to bring the deal into force.</P>

<P>"Belgian energy minister Olivier Deleuze said
international climate talks that start in Marrakesh,
Morocco, today must result in a legally binding text
spelling out Kyoto's rules, clearly showing its economic
impact on participants.</P>

<P>"'If we come to an agreement in Marrakesh then it will be
quite difficult for countries to say they don't have
enough information to say whether they will ratify or
not,' Deleuze told Reuters in an interview.  (((Stern
warning there, huh?  Whoa!)))</P>

<P>"Belgium currently holds the rotating presidency of the
EU, which represents the 15-nation bloc at international
talks.  (((Belgium Saviour of World; Grateful Mankind
Agrees To Learn Flemish and French.)))</P>

<P>"'If the United States has the same behaviour as they had
in Bonn, that will be fine by me,' he said.   ((("Shut up
and sit down, deadbeats.")))
</p>

<P>"The United States, which will attend Marrakesh as a
party to the 1992 U.N. framework convention on climate
change which spawned Kyoto, has said it would not disrupt
other countries' progress on the pact unless it risked
damaging U.S. interests.  (((Whatever's left of them.)))
</p>

<P>"Although the hijacked airliner attacks on New York and
Washington and the subsequent 'war on terrorism' have
hogged the headlines since September 11, Deleuze said
climate change would remain a crucial issue for
international diplomacy.
</p>

<P>"'I am not convinced (climate change) is less
important because of September 11, maybe it is even more
important.'"  (((Yeah it is, unless you think physics
stops dead in its tracks while people are getting shot.)))</P>

<P>REUTERS NEWS SERVICE</P>

<P>"US may be isolated at Kyoto talks - minister
((("Here's our chair, guys, this isolated sideline
backseat.")))</P>

<P>"MOROCCO: October 29, 2001</P>

<P>"RABAT - The United States may seem isolated at global
warming talks next week at a time when it seeks global
cooperation to fight terrorism, a Moroccan government
minister said last week. ((("Seem"?  Has al-Jazeera
contacted Osama on this issue?)))</P>

<P>"The United States in March pulled out of the Kyoto pact -
a 1997 international accord on cutting greenhouse
emissions - after President George W. Bush called it
'fatally flawed' and contrary to U.S. economic interests.
(((Plenty flawed -- and a little more fatal every day.)))
</p>

<P>"'We'd wish they (the Americans) were not outside
(the pact), especially after September 11,' Environment
Minister Mohamed El Yazghi told Reuters in an interview.
</p>

<P>"'Their interest is clearly not to be isolated but
they run the risk of appearing to defend only their own
interests,' he said.  ((("And one of these days, we might
figure out who to blame when we're stacking sandbags.")))
</p>

<P>(...) "Although world attention is on the fight
against terrorism and U.S.-led military strikes on
Afghanistan after last month's suicide airliner attacks on
the New York and Washington, experts said environmental
issues are here to stay.  (((Where are they supposed to
go, exactly?)))</P>
