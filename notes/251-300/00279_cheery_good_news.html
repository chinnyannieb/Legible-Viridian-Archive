</BLOCKQUOTE>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>"SAN FRANCISCO == In a major overhaul of their power<BR>
system, San Francisco voters have approved a $100 million<BR>
bond to fund the nation's biggest solar power project in<BR>
one of the country's most famously foggy cities. (((Not so<BR>
famously foggy, however, as to put up with Texan energy<BR>
companies ruthlessly stiffing them.)))
</P>

<P>"(...) The measures follow a year of turmoil in
California as the state's botched energy deregulation
scheme unexpectedly resulted in rocketing wholesale and
retail power costs, utility bankruptcy and rolling
blackouts.  (((That turmoil is far from over, too; it's
just that the predators formerly rolling in dough are now gasping for air.)))</p>

<p>"The main solar power initiative == which had
widespread popular and political backing in this
traditionally liberal city == won by a landslide 73-to-26
percent margin.  (((Three to One!  Woah!)))</p>

<P>"Under its provisions, the city will move ahead with
plans to issue a $100 million revenue bond to install 10
megawatts of solar and 30 megawatts of wind power
generation on city property, moves which should supply
about one quarter of all the power consumed by city</P>

<P>government.  (((Not the power consumed by the city, mind<BR>
you == by the city <STRONG>government.</STRONG>  Oh well, it's a<BR>
start.)))</P>

<P>"A second solar initiative, passed by a somewhat
narrower margin, allows the city's Board of Supervisors to
issue more solar revenue bonds without seeking voter
approval, allowing the city government gradually to expand
the solar power program to individual houses and
businesses.  (((Yay!)))
</P>

<P>"Tuesday's landslide vote does not mean construction
will begin tomorrow.
</p>

<P>"Under the structure of the revenue bond, final
approval for the project will come from bond investors who
will decide whether or not the plan is economically
feasible.  (((Then let's hope the skeptics lost their
shirts in Enron's stock collapse.)))
</p>

<P>"But officials are optimistic that within four years</P>

<P>San Francisco will have 10 megawatts of solar power in<BR>
place == eclipsing Sacramento, California, as the largest<BR>
single solar power producer in the country.</p>

<P>"The city's solar power plan has been hailed as a big
step forward for the solar power industry because it will</P>

<P>establish a steady and growing market for photovoltaic<BR>
cells == creating the economies of scale that will allow<BR>
producers to ramp up production and bring the cost down.</p>

<P>"'We have just created an enormous market for solar
energy in the United States,' said Danny Kennedy, local
campaign coordinator for the environmental group
Greenpeace, which mobilized behind the solar power
initiative.
</p>

<P>"'What we need, the market transformation for a
massive growth in solar demand and solar production, will
come about due to incremental steps like this. If other
cities follow San Francisco model we can bring the price
down sharply.'
</p>

<P>(...) "Pacific Gas &amp; Electric, forced into bankruptcy
in April after amassing billions of dollars in debt during
California's power crisis, fought hard against the public
power initiatives, spending more than $1 million in an
effort to persuade city voters that it was still best
positioned to serve as San Francisco's power provider.
(((Bankrupt, sure, but they still have a handy million
bucks to buy the voters with.)))
</p>

<P>"The giant utility unit of San Francisco-based PG&amp;E</P>

<P>Corp. has vowed to fight any moves by the city to take<BR>
over its power infrastructure == a central plank of the<BR>
public power plan == and said it would await the final<BR>
vote count before conceding defeat at the ballot box.<BR>
(((Graceful all the way.  Meanwhile, in distant, sunny<BR>
Morocco...)))</p>

<P>"MOROCCO: November 8, 2001</P>

<P>"MARRAKESH, Morocco == Government ministers from around<BR>
the world moved a step closer yesterday to bringing a far-<BR>
reaching treaty to combat global warming into force after<BR>
their officials reached a key agreement.</p>

<P>"Ministers were upbeat in addressing U.N. talks in
Marrakesh to define the practicalities of the pact
committing industrialised nations to cut their 'greenhouse
gas' emissions by an average five percent of 1990 levels
by 2012.
</p>

<P>"Many were encouraged by a breakthrough in lower-level</P>

<P>talks late this week that put in place a system to ensure<BR>
that countries comply with their pollution targets ==<BR>
previously seen as a stumbling block which could have sunk<BR>
the fragile treaty.</p>

<P>"'The progress made thus far is solid and encouraging,'
Iran's Environment Minister Massoumeh Ebtekathe told the
plenary session on behalf of the G77 group of developing
countries.  (((Massoumeh Ebtekathe is an Iranian, Muslim,
woman.  From an OPEC state.  She's encouraged by global
diplomacy while the Yankees quail.  Go figure.)))
</p>

<P>"'The agreement reached last night is indeed a very
good outcome,' she said.
</p>

<P>"The question of whether countries that emit more
greenhouse gases than allowed under the so-called Kyoto
Protocol of 1997 would face binding sanctions had been
thorny at recent similar forums, but many delegates said
it now seemed settled.  (((Especially since the Americans,
the number one planetary offenders and the primary target
for thorny binding sanctions, aren't there.)))
</p>

<P>"'UNPRECEDENTED IN INTERNATIONAL LAW'  (((It's been a
good month for such things)))
</p>

<P>"Environmental groups, which had accused Japan,
Russia, Canada and Australia of trying to wriggle out of a
binding sanctions regime for countries that miss their
pollution targets, welcomed the agreement.
</p>

<P>"'Binding consequences are definitely there,'
Jennifer Morgan of the World Wildlife Fund said.
'Countries now know if they miss their targets there will
be consequences.'  ((("Henceforth we can declare a new
kind of war on the sinister ExxonMobil network,  pursuing
their menacing economic fronts until we smoke them out of
their holes!")))
</p>

<P>"Tuiloma Neroni Slade, Samoa's ambassador to the U.N.
who chaired the talks on compliance, called the compliance
system's strength 'unprecedented in international law'.
(...)
</p>

<P>"Stressing the importance of a climate change treaty,
U.N. Secretary General Kofi Annan said the Kyoto process,
which was rejected by the United States in March, was 'a
victory for multilateralism.' (...)
</p>

<P>"The United States faced a barrage of criticism when
it pulled out of the treaty saying Kyoto's pollution-
cutting requirements for developed countries but not
poorer ones would hurt the U.S. economy.  (((What's left
of it.)))</P>

<P>"NO HINT OF A U.S. RETURN
</p>

<P>"U.S. Under-Secretary of State for Global Affairs
Paula Dobriansky  (((boo, hiss)))) gave no hint that
Washington would return to the treaty President George W.
Bush described as 'fatally flawed'.
</p>

<P>"'Our collective long-term objective must be to create
a truly global approach that stitches together actions by
all countries into a tapestry of national and
international cooperation,' she told the conference.
(((Emptily.)))
</p>

<P>(...) "The European Union, a vocal advocate of Kyoto,
has said it will ratify it next year."</P>

"UPDATE - Earth on edge of a precipice - UN report
"UK: November 8, 2001

<P>"LONDON == The human race is plundering Earth at an<BR>
unsustainable rate,  (((yes, yes, yawn, get to the<BR>
point))) but the growing power of women over their own<BR>
futures  (((huh?!))) could save the planet from<BR>
destruction, the United Nations said yesterday.</p>

<P>"'We are looking over a cliff here. It is a crisis of
global proportions that needs to be addressed with some
urgency,' Alex Marshall, editor of the U.N. Population
Fund's annual report for 2001 told a news conference.
</p>

<P>"The report, 'Footprints and Milestones: Population
and Environmental Change', said bluntly more people were
using more resources more intensively than ever before.
</p>

<P>"'Putting this report together scared me stiff quite
frankly,' Marshall said.  (((Maybe you should rename it
"Diapers and Diplomas," Alex.)))
</p>

<P>"But he added that a ray of hope lay in the fact that
women were winning the war to control their fertility and
had finally gained the ear of government and big business.
</p>

<P>"'One of the major changes is the increasing power of
women's groups. Women are getting together as never before
and are making changes,' he said.  (((And if those women
<STRONG>don't</STRONG> make some changes and gain some power, we can get
the US military to blow up their patriarchal oppressors!)))

<p>"'Nearly 60 percent of women now have access to some sort of family planning == even if you take China out of that you still have about 40 percent,' he explained in an interview to Reuters. (...)</p>

<P>"The world's population, which has doubled to 6.1
billion in the past 40 years, is projected to surge 50
percent to 9.3 billion within another half century, with
all the growth in developing countries whose resources are
already overstretched.  (((Apparently, they're all going
to stand on each other's feet for 50 years while a
depopulating Russia becomes a vast vacant lot.)))
</p>

<P>"The HIV/AIDS epidemic was threatening to swamp
Africa and and was spreading very rapidly in Asia with
four million people already infected in India alone out of
a world total of 35 million carriers of the deadly
disease, Marshall said.
</p>

<P>"The report said 15.5 million more people would die
from HIV/AIDS over the next five years in the 45 most
affected countries than would otherwise be the case."
(((HIV/AIDS is definitely not good news, but this report
panics over a deadly epidemic while it also panics over a
population boom. Huh?  What this UN report really suggests
is that people who don't control sex will not survive
their ignorance.)))</P>
