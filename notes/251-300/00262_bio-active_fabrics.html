"Bacteria could create self-cleaning clothes</P>

<P>by Eugenie Samuel<br>

Boston, July 5,  02001</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bacteria impregnated into every single fibre of a
fabric, could live, breed and eat up the dirt, creating
self-cleaning clothes.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Eventually, the garments in your wardrobe may be able
to support a variety of bacteria engineered to eat odour-
causing chemicals and human sweat. Other bacteria might
secrete waterproof and protective coatings to extend the
life of clothing and produce antiseptic for bandages.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ironically, textile makers have spent millions
developing fibres blended with, say, silver ions or
chlorine to kill off the bugs in fabric. But encouraging
bacteria to grow on fibres turned out to be harder than
Alex Fowler, from the University of Massachusetts at
Dartmouth, had expected.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'I thought they would wick into the fibre by
capillary action, but it didn't turn out like that,' he
says. Brute force was required.  (((It takes real he-men
to domesticate and wear bacteria.)))</P>

<P>"Vacuum action</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fowler and his team developed a vacuum pump that could
connect to the end of the hollow fibres from the milkweed
plant. Although no longer used to make clothes, the plant
is still used to make rope. (((Are hemp enthusiasts
listening?)))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The pump sucks a few drops of agar jelly containing
Escherichia coli into the fibre. The bacteria easily
formed a thriving colony and began to breed. In the most
recent tests, Fowler had no problem firing several hundred
bacteria into the fibre. 'They're tough little guys,' says
Fowler. ((("Hey look, I just 'fired' my T-shirt's
armpits!")))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Fowler uses a harmless strain of E. coli genetically
engineered to produce a fluorescent protein from a
jellyfish. This makes the bacterium glow as it grows,
allowing researchers to monitor its progress.  ((("My Dad
Went To U. Mass Dartmouth, And All I Got Was This
Genetically Altered Milkweed-Fiber T-Shirt That Glows in
the Dark Like a Jellyfish.")))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So far, the group can't be sure how long the
bacteria will survive in the fibres. They'll probably
become dormant after several weeks when their food supply
runs out, but Fowler hopes to reactivate them by soaking
the milkweed fibres in additional nutrients. (((Baby barf,
egg-drop soup... imagine the possibilities!)))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"So if your shirt was impregnated with a strain of E.
coli designed to feed on human sweat and the proteins that
cause body odours, you'd only have to wear it to jolt the
bugs into action.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"For some other strains, you might have to douse it
with additional nutrients occasionally. 'You could end up
having to feed your shirt instead of wash it,' says
Fowler.  (((And since E. Coli happily lives in and on
human flesh, your odor-free intestines can also glow in
the dark!)))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Sweaty jeans</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Alex Lightman,  chief executive officer of Charmed
Technology, a California-based fashion company that
designs futuristic outfits, (((<A HREF="http://www.charmed.com">http://www.charmed.com</A>, be
there or be square))) says the market may not be ready for
a living suit just yet, but he thinks it's a great idea.
'I like it, get me one,' he says.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lightman points out that most people are familiar
with the idea that we have bacteria living on us all the
time anyway.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'I wear the same pair of jeans all the time and I'm
sure they have bacterial colonies living in them, but if
they were selected to convert my sweat into sweet-smelling
pheromones, that would be great,' he says."  (((Me three!
They'll also make great after-dinner napkins when we're
all devoured by Parsee vultures!)))</P>

<P>(((And now for the hard work behind the pop-science
headlines.  The following science proposal explains how
people swing grants for this kind of activity.)))</P>

<P>"National Textile Center<BR>
Year 10 Project Proposal</P>

<P>"Development of Bio-Active Fabrics</P>

<P>"Project Team: Leader Alex J. Fowler<BR>
UMass Dartmouth / Bioengineering<BR>
Email: afowler@umassd.edu </P>

<P>"Objective:</P>

<P>"To develop fabrics that contain micro-fabricated bio-
environments and biologically activated fibers.  These
fabrics will ultimately have genetically engineered
bacteria and cells incorporated into them, which will
enable them to generate and replenish chemical coatings
and chemically active components.</P>

<P>"*  Micro-fabricate devices able to sustain cellular or
bacterial life for extended periods and capable of being
incorporated into fibers or fabrics.</P>

<P>"*  Test these biological micro-environments for tolerance
to extremes of temperature, humidity and exposure to
washing agents.</P>

<P>"*  Incorporate micro-fabricated bio-environments into
fabrics and test their tolerance to physical stress on the
fabrics: tension, crumpling and pressure.</P>

<P>"*  Identify the major obstacles to the long-term function
of bio-active fabrics and the strategies to overcome
them."</P>

<P>(((It's honest work!)))</P>

<P><BR>
"Relevance to NTC Mission: </P>

<P>"Biotechnology is revolutionizing the way problems are
solved in almost all areas of life. Bacteria are used to
remediate oil and chemical spills; genetically engineered
plants resist pests and weed killers; and bioreactors are
used to produce drugs and enzymes to treat cancer and
unclog drains.  The scope and usefulness of bio-engineered
products are constantly increasing.  (((So let's <STRONG>wear</STRONG>
some!)))</P>

<P>"Clothing is an ideal medium in which to implant mobile
bio-environments.  Niche applications for bio-active
fabrics exist in the medical and defense industries ==
e.g. drug producing bandages  (((!))) or protective
clothing with highly sensitive cellular sensors == but
bio-fabrics may form the basis of a whole new line of
commercial products as well: fabrics that literally eat
odors with genetically engineered bacteria, self cleaning
fabrics and fabrics that continually regenerate water and
dust repellants.</P>

<P>(((And, if he don't pay for the patented microbes, the
bacteria can devour the deadbeat's flesh like the fatal
cloak of Hercules!  Those "cellular sensors" that glow in
the dark sound especially promising in the erotic
nightwear market.)))</P>

<P>(...)</P>

<P>"State of the Art:</P>

<P>"The micro-fabrication of biological micro-environments is
well established.  (...) Our lab focuses primarily on the
use of micro-fabrication of cellular environments for use
in bio-artificial organs.   Micro-electronic manufacturing
systems  technology  (MEMS) (((wahoo!))) and the use of
polydimethylsiloxane enables us to build bio-friendly
microstructures.  (...)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Most of the work in fabric biotechnology has been in
the development of biocidal fabrics. (((<STRONG>Killing</STRONG> germs?
How backward of them.)))  (...)  Our concept differs in
wanting to use genetically engineered bacteria and cell
strains to manufacture the chemicals within the textiles
themselves, thereby making the chemical stores within the
fabrics self-replenishing.  In addition our emphasis will
not be on the production of generically biocidal or anti-
microbial chemicals. (...)</P>

<P>"Approach:</P>

<P>(...) "We are now incorporating these bacteria into
milkweed and raw cotton fibers.  We are investigating
efficient ways to introduce bacterial growth medium into
the hollow fiber cores with the aid of the wetting agents
Trycol 5950/52 and Ethal-DA-4/6.  We have found that the
autofluoresence of both milkweed and cotton fibers
obscures the GFP signal somewhat; but we have also
acquired a second genetically engineered strain of e. coli
that produces bioluminescent luciferase. (...)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bacteria in a favorable environment will grow
exponentially until they have exhausted the surrounding
nutrients.  In some applications these nutrients may be
replenished by human body excretion (sweat), (((and why
stop there?  It's not like the human body lacks
excretions)))  but for other applications the growth of
bacteria needs to be controlled. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will control the growth kinetics of bacterial
colonies within the fibers by genetically engineering
amino-acid deficient bacteria.  These bacteria are
incapable of growth unless the selected amino-acid is
provided externally.  We will manufacture micro-fabricated
time release capsules to deliver the amino acid to the
environment in a controlled manner, thereby, providing
predictable and controllable bacterial growth. ((("New
TIDE Non-Detergent, With Selected Amino Acids")))</P>


<P>(...)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If fiber fragility is shown to be a problem we will
design fabrics with reinforcing fibers surrounding the
relatively fragile bio-fibers to increase durability.  The
critical experiments at this stage will be exposure of the
bio-active fabric to environmental stresses to see which
stresses are most detrimental to long term function."
((("Hey Professor!  I sneezed on it!  Is that okay?")))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We will also develop bio-films by establishing
bacterial cultures on gas permeable substrates.  These
bio-film cultures will be incorporated into poly-laminate
fabrics.  The insulating and shell materials will be
varied. The bacterial function will be studied as a
function of the surrounding materials, substrate
permeability and interlaminar spacing. </P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The durability of poly-laminate bio-film fabrics will
be tested under tension and crumpling, as will the ability
of the bio-films to sustain and contain bacterial growth
in the face of environmental stress.  The relative
efficacy of the film based fabric versus the hollow fiber
based fabric will be assessed both under ideal conditions
and as a function of environmental stress."</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(((They're not kidding, ladies and gentlemen.   As
our reward for persevering through the jargon, now we're
really ahead of the curve: clothes made of human and
animal skin cells!)))</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In later stages of the project we will establish
bio-active fabrics based on mammalian keratinocytes. 
These cells are tolerant of large temperature fluctuations
and naturally form biological barriers since they form the
outer surface of the skin.  We will develop encapsulated
polydimethylsiloxane bio-environments for inclusion in
poly-laminate fabrics and micro-strands that can be formed
into non-woven fabrics or incorporated into yarns.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The primary obstacle we anticipate is the
disruption of biological micro-environments when exposed
to environmental stress. ((("My underwear died!"))) (...)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We can anticipate that our first bio-active fabrics
will fail to sustain bacterial function, or possibly even
bacterial life, when exposed to the wide-variety of
stresses a commercial fabric would experience.  (...)  The
bio-fabrics may be humidity sensitive, temperature
sensitive or sensitive to air flow.  The biological
environments may retain function when intact, but lose
function when cracks in the hollow fiber or film layer
allow bacterial migration or contamination.  We will
determine which of these stresses seriously impair
bacterial function or survival in fabrics.  ((("My
Grandma's bacterial wedding-dress ate everything else in
this trunk!")))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"We intend in the upcoming year to begin using
Bacillus bacterial species in anticipation of these
obstacles.  While Bacillus are not as well characterized
as e. coli (making genetic engineering more difficult),
certain species of Bacillus are tolerant of heat and
alkalinity (soap).  Bacillus are also spore forming, which
makes them good candidates for applications in which the
bacteria need to be non-continuously active.  (...)</P>

<P>"Outreach to Industry: </P>

<P>"Our team is in contact with many textile manufacturers
and biotechnology companies.  We made a presentation this
year at the Intelligent Textiles Conference in
Providence.  Through that activity we made contact with
the Adidas corporation whose head of R&amp;D is very
interested in bio-active footwear. (((Brings fresh meaning</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>to the term "sweatshop!")))   We have also been contacted<BR>
by the Titleist Corporation regarding this project. </P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<P>"New Resources Required: </P>

<P>"(...) The major capital expense is the establishment of a
biotechnology laboratory at UMass Dartmouth.  This year we
established a state of the art microscopy facility and
bacterial culture lab.  In the upcoming year we need to
expand our cell and tissue culture facility to allow for
the culture of larger bacterial colonies and of mammalian
cells.  Continuing expenses mostly support graduate
students, post-doctoral researchers and costs associated
with genetic engineering and microfabrication."  (((I hope
that'll fit in my closet.)))</P>
