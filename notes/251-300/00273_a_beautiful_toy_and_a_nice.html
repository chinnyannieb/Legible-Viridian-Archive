"Creating New, Sky-High Power
By Stewart Taggart

<PRE>
"SYDNEY, Australia == Looking somewhat like a huge,
upturned golf tee, it would be the highest man-made
structure on earth. It would also provide electricity to
as many as 200,000 homes.
</PRE>
<!-- end of user-specified pre-formatted text -->
<BR>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If built, a proposed 200-megawatt 'solar chimney' for
rural Australia would become the most daring application
yet of a quirky form of generating alternative, renewable
electricity. While the engineering would be biblical in
scale, the concept itself is simple.
<BR>
</P>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A circular greenhouse with an upward sloping roof
toward the center would draw heated air through
electricity-generating turbines before allowing it to
escape through a central 'chimney.' The hitch? The
greenhouse would cover six square miles, and the chimney
would stand more than a half-mile tall.  (((Yike!)))
<BR>
</P>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Over the next two years, the public Australian
company EnviroMission Ltd. will be searching sunny,
spacious Australia for the ideal site to put such a huge
chimney and greenhouse. EnviroMission hopes to break
<!-- User-specified pre-formatted text -->
<PRE>
ground on the project in 2003 and be generating
electricity == as much as 500 gigawatt hours per year ==
by 2005.
</PRE>
<!-- end of user-specified pre-formatted text -->
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That is, if it can convince the skeptics.  (((Oh.
Is  that a problem?)))  Why? Because the closest
approximation to such a huge proposed monocle-in-the-
desert, which has been built thus far, was a 50-kilowatt
demonstration prototype built in Spain in the early 1980s.
(((Built by the same guys, too.)))  While that prototype
operated successfully for two years, it's an open question
just how well the concept will ramp up when 40 times
larger.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Every single independent expert we have spoken to
has no doubt that this level of scalability is possible,'
says Roger Davey, chief financial officer for
EnviroMission. 'The economics point to 200 megawatts as
the optimum size.'  (((Anything smaller doesn't make
money, unfortunately.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The key to the technology lies in creating an
environment that maintains a temperature differential
between the inside and the outside of the greenhouse.
Under those conditions, air inside the greenhouse rushes
along the upward-sloping ceiling toward the center,
creating a near constant 'wind' that then turns the
turbines.  (((Fight the Greenhouse with a greenhouse.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At night, heat-absorbing rocks or other heat sources
in the greenhouse would slowly release the thermal energy
built up during the day, maintaining the indoor-outdoor
temperature differential. Then the 'solar chimney' could
operate around the clock, instead of depending on
environmental factors, such as the wind needed for wind
farms.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Unless the chimney falls over, or they pick totally
the wrong materials for the greenhouse, the 'solar
chimney' idea should work,' says Keith Lovegrove, chairman
of the Australian and New Zealand Solar Energy Society.
'There's no question about the principles, because it's so
incredibly simple.'</P>

<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The idea of solar chimneys has been around since the
late 1970s, says Daniel Kammen, director of the Renewable
and Appropriate Energy Laboratory based at the University
of California at Berkeley. But at that time, many believed
the 1970's era of high oil prices would prove transitory.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That, coupled with technical challenges and a belief
that there was no money to be made in alternative energy,
left solar chimneys and other alternative energy
technologies unexplored and unfunded until now.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These days, given ongoing worries about energy
security and an increased focus on environmental factors,
industry players are waking up to just about anything with
the word 'renewable' attached to it. EnviroMission appears
to be one such company.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(...)  "The estimated construction cost of the plant
would be around US $342 million, costing about 70 percent
more per installed megawatt than a comparable wind farm,
Davey says. But he believes that disadvantage could well
be wiped away by the solar chimney's ability to generate
power more consistently than fickle wind.
<BR>
</P>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Nonetheless, seeing will be believing for some
people, he acknowledges. 'Building credibility is perhaps
our hardest job going forward,' Davey says.  (((Speaking
as a design critic, one does wonder a bit about a proposed
technology that <STRONG>begins</STRONG> with the world's "highest
structure".)))
<BR>
</P>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"First, take the engineering challenges. A 200-
megawatt capacity 'solar chimney' is going to require a
circular greenhouse almost 2.5 miles in diameter,
enclosing a total area of more than six square miles.
<BR>
<!-- User-specified pre-formatted text -->
<PRE>
    "That would make it one of the largest man-made
structures == let alone greenhouses == ever built. The
second engineering challenge is building the chimney that
== at 3,250-feet high == would be more than twice as tall
as the world's highest building, Kuala Lumpur's 1,569-foot
high Petronas Tower.  (((Okay, how 'bout building it onto
</PRE>
<!-- end of user-specified pre-formatted text -->
the side of a very, very tall cliff?  No wait!  We'll
launch a big satellite into a Clarke geosynchronous orbit
and <STRONG>lower</STRONG> the thing down on a ladder!)))
<BR>
</P>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Davey says these challenges can be met with
largely off-the-shelf expertise.
<BR>
</P>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Next question: Why Australia?
<BR>
</P>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The answer: lots of sunshine, lots of space and a
federal law requiring energy retailers to ramp up their
purchases of renewable energy by 2010, Davey says.
Already, wind farms, biomass furnaces and other
alternative energy plants are being planned for Australia.
The solar chimney is merely joining the list, Davey says.
(...)
<BR>
</P>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Ultimately, if EnviroMission can supply as much as
500 gigawatt hours of power per year, it could help
Australia avoid pumping 830,000 tons of gases that would
contribute to the greenhouse effect into the atmosphere,
<!-- User-specified pre-formatted text -->
<PRE>
Davey says. That's because the plant would largely
supplant coal burning == Australia's major electricity
fuel source.  (((Okay, wait a minute == you build the
chimney <STRONG>straight down a coal mine,</STRONG> and then you just
remove all the surrounding rock.)))
</PRE>
<!-- end of user-specified pre-formatted text -->
<BR>
</P>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But Eric Hu, a senior lecturer in energy and thermal
engineering at Melbourne's Deakin University, suggests any
greenhouse benefits could be a fantasy.
<BR>
</P>
<P>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"That's because by trapping heat, such a chimney could
reduce Earth's 'albedo,' or ability to reflect light back
into space. Thus, by transforming solar radiation into
<!-- User-specified pre-formatted text -->
<PRE>
heat, a solar chimney might actually contribute to warming
earth's atmosphere == even while reducing emissions of
greenhouse gases.  (((You heard it here first, ladies and
gentlemen == the <STRONG>solar heat-pollution threat.</STRONG>  But Dr.
Hu is clearly a spoilsport == because any thermal energy
trapped by this giant chimney can easily be offset by
</PRE>
<!-- end of user-specified pre-formatted text -->
paving another six square miles with a mirror.  Piece o'
cake.)))</P>

<P>"Meet the Dr. Karlosi Think Tank. Right out of the
classic sci-fi of the fifties with 90's technology. All
gleaming steel and aluminum with rubber hoses, it is a
special effects triumph, standing over 47" tall. Plug it
in. Lights and bubbler run on standard 110 volt house
current. Your spare brain floating inside is resilient
gray latex. So realistic you can almost hear the moans of
its lost owner. The Pump is guaranteed for 25 years.
Priced at $225 (US) + $18 shipping &amp; handling."</P>

<P>(((These times clearly call for spare brains, and what
better place to find some than a workshop for science
fiction writers?  This weekend, October 6, sees yet
another installment in the far-famed and remarkably long-
lived Turkey City Workshop.  The literary lioness at this
weekend's event is a dear friend and justly prominent
editor, Ellen Datlow, who is flying down from New York
City to give the Texan locals what-for.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(((Turkey City is not, in point of fact, a Viridian
event.  But who cares?   As long as the doors are open,
the weather's nice, and brainy geeks of a vaguely
futuristic bent are wandering in and out, you might as
well drop by.  We are fresh back from a local green-energy
event, so we have a bunch of propaganda and some brand-new
Viridian t-shirts.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(((Festivities will start around 8:30 Saturday night.
If you're interested in making the scene and meeting Ms
Datlow, send me some email so I can get a head-count. I'll
also explain how to get here, if you don't, in point of
fact, know already.)))</P>
