<P>"<strong>World Temperature Second Highest on Record</strong><br>
Dec 18 2001 11:47AM</P>

<P>"GENEVA (Reuters) — This year has been the second warmest
on record  and the trend toward higher mean global
temperatures looks set to  continue, World Meteorological
Organization officials said Tuesday.
</P>

<P>"Compared with the 1961-1990 average used as the basis
for comparison,  officials said the global temperature in
2001 rose a fraction of a  degree Fahrenheit to 57.2 F.
((("Gee, that doesn't sound very hot...  hey wait a
minute, how come my garage flooded?")))
</P>

<P>"It is the 23rd year in succession that temperatures
have been above the 1961-1990 mean.  (((Anyone want to bet
on when we get a year <STRONG>below</STRONG> the mean?  Will anyone on
this list live that long?)))
</P>

<P>"The 2001 average temperature was second only to 1998
when temperatures rose under the impact of La Nina, the
sister phenomenon to El Nino, both of which are caused by
abnormal warming of surface water in the Pacific Ocean.
(...)
</P>

<P>"World Meteorological Organization officials said the
warming trend  would be accompanied by further cases of
extreme weather conditions == both flooding and drought as
well as sharp temperature variations.  But it was not
possible to predict where the weather events would  occur.
(((Could be your house!)))
</P>

<P>"They noted the overall trend to higher mean
temperatures did not mean that some parts of the world
would not experience extreme cold, as  happened last
winter in Russia.  ((("North Pole chased from top of
planet; Santa settles over Europe")))
</P>

<P>"Officials said the rising mean temperature and the
frequency of  extreme climatic conditions, such as the
devastating drought  currently plaguing central Asia, were
consistent with a pattern of global warming. (...) ((("We
wanted to re-locate as there is no water left" -- O. bin
Laden &amp; Co.)))</P>

<P><strong>2001 temps 'second highest' on record</strong><br>
December 18, 2001 Posted: 9:21 PM EST 
(0221 GMT)</P>

<P>"GENEVA, Switzerland (AP) — The Earth's temperature in
the year 2001 is expected to be the second highest since
global records began 140 years ago, the U.N. weather
agency said Tuesday, more proof of global warming caused
by humans.
</P>

<P>"The World Meteorological Organization said the warming
temperatures led to an increase in the severity and
frequency of storms and droughts and other unusual weather
conditions.
</P>

<P>"'Temperatures are getting hotter, and they are
getting hotter faster now than at any time in the past,'
said Michel Jarraud, the organization's deputy secretary-
general.
</P>

<P>"Nine of the 10 warmest years in the last four decades
have occurred since 1990, and temperatures are rising
three times faster than in the early 1900s, he said.
</P>

<P>"This year's global average surface temperature was
expected to be 57.96 Fahrenheit, the World Meteorological
Organization said. The record, set in 1998, was 58.24
Fahrenheit.
</P>

<P>"'Much of the temperature change is down to human
influence," said Ken Davidson, director of the
organization's climate program department. 'There are
always skeptics on everything, but certainly the evidence
we have today shows we do have global warming, and that
most of this is due to human action.'"</P>

<P>(((You'd think this was pretty bad news for humanity, a
clear and present danger to our health and safety, etc
etc. == unless you were Chris Paynter of "Greening Earth
Society." Watch ol' Chris scuttle under George W. Bush's
political skirts here, despite the fact that the same move
didn't do Enron any good. Chris always hated Enron anyhow,
because Enron burned natural gas instead of coal.  Coal
guys pay for Greening Earth and their Beltway spin
operation.)))</P>

<P>((("We're Caroling In The Dirty Slush")))</P>

<P>"As the end of 2001 nears, folks are busy with their
calculations to determine the earth's average temperature
for another year. Usually, in their great excitement to
proclaim that some extreme value has been reached or some
record exceeded, the calculators don't wait until all the
data are in, but do their best to estimate the temperature
anomaly based upon whatever data they've collected so far.
</P>

<P>"This year, the number-crunchers relying on data from
surface thermometers and sea-surface temperature
measurements will proudly announce (if they have not done
so already) that 2001 was the second-warmest year ever
measured. And since the current record holder, 1998, was
associated with the mother of all El Ninos (that is, if El
Ninos can be mothers), (((a little light humor in the
climate refugee camp here))) 2001 therefore represents the
warmest 'normal' year, and would seem to provide further
evidence that global climate models are right and
therefore we should believe everything they tell us and
that George W. should reconsider the United States'
withdrawal from the Kyoto Protocol.  (((And that people
should stop burning my employers' coal, thus causing me to
lose my job.)))
</P>

<P>"But let's look beneath the surface, as it were == or
above, actually. What these announcements will fail to
include is that the average temperature in 2001 in the
atmospheric layer from the earth's surface up to about
25,000 feet as measured by NASA satellites was just about
normal.  (((No it wasn't.))) Of the 23 years on record
(satellite measurements of temperature began in 1979), 13
years were colder than 2001 and 9 were warmer. And those
facts serve as further evidence that global climate models
are wrong and their projections should be viewed with
caution and skepticism and that George W. is right on the
money.  (((<STRONG>My</STRONG> money.  Yahoo!)))</P>
