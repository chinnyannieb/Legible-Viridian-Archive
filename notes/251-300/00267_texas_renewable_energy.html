first Texas Renewable Energy Roundup in 2000. See these

<P>(((We're going to the second one too.  Not only are we
going to demo our customary Viridian books, mags, weird
blobjects and imaginary products, we're even going to sell
some stuff.  Furthermore, if all goes to plan, I'll be
delivering a Viridian speech on bizarre energy toys. Why
should you go?  Here's the pitch.)))</P>

<P><BR>

(((If you are entirely new to Viridian List, you may
somehow be unaware that Texas, a state synonymous with the
oil industry, has a green power industry.  But it does,
and developments proceed apace.  The Roundup is the place
to water the grass roots.   Be there or be square.</P>

<P>(((Incidentally, in Austin, we are having violent
rainstorms and it is flooding.)))</P>

<P>"Texas in big push to develop wind power</P>

<P>"HOUSTON - Texas, whose fortunes have long been tied up
with its fossil fuel wealth, is defying its popular image
as a state dominated by cigar-chomping oil barons and
pushing hard to develop wind power.</P>

<P>"Wind turbines are sprouting up on hilltops and mesas in
the remote western expanses of the state, helping to
offset the economic effects of declining production from
aging oil fields.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Texas wind farms are still generating relatively
modest amounts of energy compared with the state's oil and
gas production, which remain the largest in the nation.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But after a late entry into the wind business, Texas
will soon overtake Minnesota and Iowa and rank second to
California, an early mover that has shown little growth in
recent years. (...)
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"State legislation to promote renewable energy, plus
improved technology that has reduced costs and a surge in
natural gas prices last winter have all contributed to the
Texas wind boom.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As of July 2001, Texas had just under 200 megawatts
of wind power capacity up and running and had an
additional 900 megawatts planned, much of it slated to
come on line by the end of the year, according to the
American Wind Energy Association (AWEA).
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One of those projects, the 278 megawatt King
Mountain wind farm in Upton County, near President George
W. Bush's boyhood home of Midland, will be among the
largest in the world and is backed by some big players
from the traditional electric power industry."</P>
