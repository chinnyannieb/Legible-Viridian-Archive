<h2>"Algeria's worst floods in 40 years kill 579</h2>

<P>"November 12, 2001 Posted: 2126 GMT</P>

<P>"ALGIERS, Algeria (Reuters) == Algeria's worst floods in
nearly 40 years have killed at least 579 people, with 538
dead in the capital, Algiers, alone, state media reported
Monday.
<p>

<P>"A further 316 people were injured and five were
officially reported missing, although that number was
expected to climb as the cleanup continued. (((And indeed
that number did climb; see followup.)))
<p>

<P>"The government declared three days of national
mourning starting Tuesday.
<p>

<P>"The flash floods did most damage in Algiers' densely
populated working-class district of Bab el Oued. Muddy
waters cascaded down a main road, leaving many buried
under collapsed buildings or drowned in their cars.
<p>

<P>"'In terms of the number of deaths and damage, a
(flood) disaster like this hasn't happened in 39 years,' a
senior official at the Territorial Development Ministry
said. (...)
<p>

<P>"In Raspail alley, young volunteers dug with shovels
through dried mud that rose up to 6 feet high. Asked if
they had found bodies, 28-year-old Hamid Ridouche replied,
'You are now walking on a cemetery.'  (((Nice soundbite,
Hamid.  You should go into journalism.)))
<p>

<P>"About 5,500 families were left homeless, including
2,072 in Algiers, a hilly city of 3.5 million, official
figures showed.
<p>

<P>"The flash floods came after heavy rain and strong
gales Friday and Saturday lashed coastal parts of Africa's
second largest country, which extends far south into the
Sahara Desert. (...)
<p>

<P>"The government of Prime Minister Ali Benflis, under
heavy fire from the press for its apparent failure to cope
in time with the disaster, said it would give emergency
financial aid to families who lost loved ones and their
homes. (((People always blame the government during
Greenhouse events.  The government always distributes
bailout tax money.  If the victims would just hit up
ExxonMobil, ConocoPhilips and ChevronTexacoDynegyEnron,
wow, would solar power ever look cheap.)))</P>

<P>((((Here comes the good part.)))
<p>

<P>"Residents said the disaster could have been avoided if
authorities had not sealed underground sewers running
through Bab el Oued three years ago.
<p>

<P>"The move was to keep Islamic rebels from using the
ducts as hiding places in their 10-year-long bloody
campaign against the military-backed government.
<p>

<P>"'These tunnels could have channeled away a large
amount of water and avoided the catastrophe,' said
Mustapha Dajaballah. (((Now there's a curiosity for you,
ladies and gentlemen:  it's a Mujihadeen-Related Wexelblat
Disaster.  And it's rather unlikely to be the last.
Imagine trying to flee an American flood or hurricane
under conditions of tight security lockdown.  What if
those facial-recognition units fritz out down at the bus
station?)))</P>

<P>"Devastation Follows Algerian Storms</P>

<P>By HASSANE MEFTAHI, Associated Press Writer</P>

<P>"ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) == Massive floods and mudslides
that devastated northern Algeria and killed more than 700
people have caused nearly $300 million worth of damage,
the interior minister said Sunday.
<p>

<P>"Heavy rains pounded the capital and nearby areas
starting on Nov. 9, and the resulting mudslides knocked
down buildings, overturned vehicles and filled roads with
mounds of dirt and debris. The official death count on
Sunday was at 729, with 170 people still missing. Hundreds
were injured. (...)
<p>

<P>"Specialists in disease control were working in the
worst-hit areas to monitor drinking water and drainage
canals. Mustapha Bouziane, a top health official in the
capital, Algiers, said authorities had so far seen no
signs that contagious diseases were spreading. (((Oh good.
Note exploding-sewers angle.)))
<p>

<P>"Bulldozers continued to chip away at mounds of
hardened mud, debris and crushed vehicles that filled the
streets of the devastated neighborhood of Bab el-Oued,
where efforts focused on a market covered over by dirt.
(((Now check this out.)))  Security forces blocked traffic
routes leading to the worst-hit neighborhoods. (((In a
Moodge situation, the worst neighborhoods in town <STRONG>are</STRONG>
the security threat.)))
<p>

<P>"Officials gave up hope of finding more survivors on
Wednesday, and workers turned from rescue to cleanup and
moved in with heavy-duty machinery.
<p>

<P>"Algerians have vehemently criticized the government's
handling of the crisis, saying it was slow and
inefficient. In some neighborhoods, spontaneous
demonstrations have broken out whenever public officials
appeared."</P>

<P>(((You know, maybe it was a <STRONG>pretty good idea</STRONG> to hold the
climate change talks in nearby Morocco.)))</P>

<P>"Weather Looms Large at Climate Talks </P>

<P>"By JAMEY KEATEN, Associated Press Writer</P>

<P>"MARRAKECH, Morocco (AP) == Its limited forests are
dwindling, its desert is encroaching on more villages and
drought is becoming more frequent. If any country knows
the meaning of climate change, it's Morocco. (...)
<p>

<P>"For the thousands of delegates gathered at the
Marrakech conference, which ends Friday, the weather has
been unusually dry. It should be the height of the rainy
season. (...)
<p>

<P>"Droughts have become more common over the last two
decades. Four of the 11 droughts in the last century
occurred in the decade from the mid-1980s to the mid-
1990s.
<p>

<P>"Areas of Morocco now suffer from a four-year drought
that has depleted water tables, browned the landscape and
wreaked havoc on farmers.
<p>

<P>"Hydroelectric plants, one of the country's few
homegrown sources of energy, are operating at a fraction
of capacity because of lower water levels.
<p>

<P>"Meanwhile, desertification threatens rural
lifestyles, such as in the usually verdant Ourika valley
in southern Morocco. (...)
<p>

<P>"Environmental degradation is contributing to the
problem. Forests cover only about one-fifth of Morocco,
and are disappearing at the rate of more than 82,500 acres
per year. (...)
<p>

<P>"Morocco is taking small steps to combat global
warming and reduce dependency on imported oil. Small-scale
pilot projects with solar, hydraulic and wind power have
been successful, Benallou said.  (((That would be Abdehanine
Benallou, the head of Morocco's Center for Development of Renewable
Energies.))) He hopes to build on them to provide renewable
energy for 7.5 million rural residents who now light their
homes with kerosene lamps and power their televisions off
car batteries.</P>

<P>On Saturday, Benallou's center unveiled a 10-year program
to increase reliance on renewable energy to 10 percent,
from about 1.5 percent now. The plan drew on advice from
the U.S. Department of Energy."</P>
