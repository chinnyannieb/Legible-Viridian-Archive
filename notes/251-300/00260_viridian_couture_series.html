<P>(((This Summer 02001 season, we have a surprising wealth
of material on weird, cool stuff to wear and carry.  This
"couture series" will be the longest set of related notes
we've ever run on Viridian List.  With luck, the next
couple of weeks will be almost entirely free of our
usual horrific weather calamities.)))</P>

<P>"Futuristic Soldier Suits to Be Chameleon-Like"
by Roxana Tiron</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"One look at Sgt. Joe Patterson, and you could see
what the U.S. Army envisions for the soldier of 2020. He
is chameleon-like, wearing an all-purpose, single-layered
uniform that not only changes colors to blend in with the
natural environment, but also guards against chemical and
biological agents. (((Civilian apps galore here.  For
civilians, the short list of Greenhouse "chemical and
biological agents" includes traffic smog, Nile virus
mosquitoes, natural gas leaks, dengue fever, refinery
effluent, pseudo-estrogens, BSE prions, diesel
particulates, and foot-and-mouth virus.)))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The cornerstone technology to turn this concept into
reality is the selectively permeable membrane, which
scientists are developing and testing at the U.S. Army
Soldier and Biological Chemical Command in Natick, Mass.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'We want integrated protection‹chem-bio,
environmental and multi-functional," said John Munroe, of
the warrior systems integration team. (((Now repeat that
sentence three times.)))  An issue that will have to be
considered, he said, is how to bring the weight of the
uniform down when adding new features. (...)</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'The selectively permeable technology is very thin
and light, it keeps the water and the chemical agents
out,' he said.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Single-layer uniforms will perform functions such as
cooling, conduction and will have embedded wires,
according to Munroe. (((So it's an air-conditioned, fully-
powered, hot-wired, light-weight, climate disaster
uniform.  And it's invisible.  What's not to like?)))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Soldiers have to be able to go under water, walk in
swamps and deal with rough terrain, he said. The current
bulk of the uniforms == with their added features ==
impedes movement to a certain extent. Cables are a big
hindrance.  'What do you think cables can do == they can
snag, and they can break. All those pins and stuff break
and it is really tough to keep our systems going if our
cables don't work," Munroe said. (((Cry me a river, laptop
boy.)))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The membrane technology being developed for the
chemical and biological suits, he added, will be used in
standard military uniforms. However, he noted, "that is
not enough. We want to integrate the environmental
protection, the stealth, the cables and the electronics.
The chemical and biological suit is just a stepping stone
for us."  (((A stepping stone straight to the Patagonia
atelier, presumably.)))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At a recent Army exhibition on Capitol Hill, Sgt.
Patterson was wearing a suit that epitomized the type of
garment that researchers at Natick hope for. On his
uniform, just on a patch on the right arm, cable was
replaced with a piece of webbing with conductive fibers.
Another patch had cooling tubes that could circulate both
cold and warm water.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'We would like to maintain a physiological level of
high performance,' Munroe said. 'If you are working hard
on a dog day afternoon in your yard, eventually, you get
beat, and your mind goes and your body goes. That is a
problem, and our soldiers are getting into that situation.
The enemy is hot and beat and we are fresh and ready. That
would be a big advantage.'  (((You bet it would: because
it's fresh-as-a-daisy NATO warriors versus pitiful, heat-
prostrated Third Worlders, in tomorrow's post-disaster
Greenhouse battlespace.)))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Natick also is looking at physiological sensors to
monitor soldiers remotely. (((How handy!))) Other
capabilities based on active electronics will allow the
suit to change colors and blend with the background. 'That
is why he is wearing black,' Munroe said, pointing at Sgt.
Patterson. 'He can change to any color he'd want.'  (((And
just imagine the fun in the streets of Genoa, when the
Black Bloc wears that 'chameleon' stuff to a meeting of
the G-8.)))</P>
