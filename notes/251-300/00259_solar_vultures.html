<P>"Parsees try solar power to replace vultures</P>

<P>"From Rahul Bedi, in New Delhi</P>

<P>"India's Zoroastrian community, better known as Parsees,
have installed solar reflectors in their Towers of Silence
in Bombay to help dispose of their dead. This following a
sharp decline in the number of vultures who normally
scavenge the corpses in keeping with tradition.</P>

<P>"The Parsee Panchayat or council, which recently installed
the eight giant reflectors in the 350-year-old towers to
hasten the decomposition of corpses, is also starting a
vulture aviary on the premises with help from a British
expert.</P>

<P>"The council has asked Ms Jemina Perry-Jones, of the
National Birds of Prey Centre, near Gloucester, to
establish the aviary for white-backed and long-billed
vultures as the birds have been dying in large numbers of
a mysterious disease."   (((Could be climate change;
directly through a disease extending its range, or
secondarily through habitat disruption.)))</P>


<P>"Ms Perry-Jones is believed to be the first non-Parsee to
enter the towers.</P>

<P>"Council trustee Mr Rustom Tirandaz said the Bombay
municipality had given permission to start the aviary with
90 vultures captured from the wild. 'By breeding the
vultures in captivity, we hope to preserve this 2,000
year-old ritual of disposing of our dead.'</P>

<P>"The Parsees cannot cremate, bury or submerge their dead
in water because they consider a corpse impure and their
Zoroastrian faith does not permit them to defile any of
the elements. The desert ritual which originated along
with their faith in Persia over 3,000 years ago dictates
that the dead be left to vultures on hilltops known as
Towers of Silence.</P>


<P>"Dead Parsees are carried on a simple bier to a ceremonial
gate, a short distance from the rounded five Towers of
Silence, where their relatives hand them over to the
socially outcast kandhiyas or traditional pallbearers, the
only ones allowed inside.</P>

<P>"The black stone towers, around 50ft high, are like three-
tiered, open-air arenas where the men are placed in the
outer circle, women in the middle and children in the
innermost for the vultures to feed upon. However, with an
average of three Parsees dying every day, the six-odd
vultures at the towers are overfed and unable to cope.
Experts claim some 100 to 120 birds are needed to deal
with the daily inflow of bodies. There are some 76,000
Parsees in India.</P>

<P>"Several Parsees in Bombay have said the solar reflectors
have proven effective. They increase the temperature of
the bodies on which they were trained to over 180 degrees,
cleanly disposing of them within a short time."</P>

<P>(((Ladies and gentlemen, even we Viridians don't come
across a tale like this every day.  Though it may be a tad
perturbing to parochial Western sensibilities, having
one's dead devoured by birds is a pleasantly Viridian
approach to a rather pressing design problem.  One
certainly has to wish Ms. Perry-Jones every success, even
though hand-raising tame vultures for a 350-year-old
Zoroastrian Tower of Silence is a job straight out of
H. P. Lovecraft.  You see, led by a socially outcast
khandiya, Jemima breaks through a crumbling enclosure just
behind the Long-Billed Vulture Aviary, and there,
inscribed in the living rock in eldritch, uncanny
glyphs... but really, don't get me started.</P>

<P>(((A Viridian approach to being devoured by birds would
likely be a tad more up-to-date. For instance, you could have
yourself tidily ground up into pellets like BSE cattle-
feed, then fed to a clutch of urban peregrine falcons on
some webcam.)))</P>
