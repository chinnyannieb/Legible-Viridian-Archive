<P>"New EU law aims to double green energy by 2010</P>

<P>"EU: July 5, 2001</P>


  <P>"BRUSSELS. The European Parliament approved a law
  yesterday that aims to double the share of renewable power
  in European Union's energy mix by 2010, forming a
  cornerstone of the EU's climate change policy.
  <P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The directive is a key part of the bloc's drive to
reduce the amount of 'greenhouse gas' emissions from
fossil fuel use and achieve its commitment under the 1997
Kyoto agreement on global warming. (((This may be the
first time I've heard Europe described as a "bloc" that is
is "driving" somewhere.)))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"EU Energy Commissioner Loyola de Palacio  (((what a
great name!))) said the law aiming to increase green
energies such as wind and solar power, was 'a major step
towards a more diversified and environmentally friendly
energy supply'.  (((Golden words for us Viridians.
'Doubling green power,' is it?  Now that's an energy
policy.  Yo ho ho!)))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'The promotion of renewable energies is an absolute 
priority for the European Commission - the Kyoto targets
  for fighting greenhouse gas emissions cannot be attained
  without a rebalancing in their favour,' de Palacio said in
  a statement.   ((("Kyoto" and "fighting" being the
  operative terms here.)))
  <BR>
  </DD></DL>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The directive aims to double the proportion of the
EU's total energy consumption that comes from renewables
to 12 percent by 2010 and increase the proportion of
renewables in electricity production to 22.1 from around
14 percent now.   (((A fifth of the electricity in Europe
is no niche market; that is a whole lot of green
energy.)))</P>

<P>(((Meanwhile, in windy, whirring Denmark, the princes of
windpower pat themselves on the back and pull out their
order books:)))</P>

<P>"DENMARK: July 5, 2001</P>

<p>"COPENHAGEN. The European wind power sector welcomed a
  new European Union renewable energy directive passed
  yesterday, saying it will improve the investment climate
  for wind energy.</p>
  
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'The winds of change are favourable to the wind
industry. We will see a dramatic increase in new countries
(using wind power) due to the directive, creating a stable
investor climate,' said Klaus Rave, president of the
European Wind Energy Association (EWEA).</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rave  (((that's another great name))) talked to
Reuters on the sidelines of a five-day European wind
energy conference and exhibition in Copenhagen. (...)</P>


<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'The directive will create a stable fundament.
(((Uh, if you say so.)))  Up to now we have been working
on expectations and hopes, in particular pinned to the
Kyoto protocol, which seems slightly insecure now,' said
Tom Pedersen, managing director at Vestas Wind Systems,
the world's largest wind turbine supplier.  'At least now
we have a framework in Europe.'  (((Tom's weeping all the
way to the bank.)))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He said the directive was beneficial to the booming wind energy sector == forecast to grow five-fold over the</P> coming 10 years </DT><DD>= because it did not prescribe a
  harmonised European support scheme and national systems
  will go on as they are.  ((("Never mind our usual
  internecine squabbles; this time, we'll all despise the
  Americans together!")))</p>
  
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition, the directive requires member states to
take necessary steps to ensure grid access for renewable
energy sources.   Grid access has notably delayed wind
power projects in Spain and rural areas in Germany.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The directive also requires all EU nations to speed
up the process of approving new wind energy projects,
which in particular would favour small and medium-sized
companies.  (((How handy!)))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The EWEA expects wind turbines generating at least 60
gigawatts  (((!))) to be installed by 2010 in Europe,
compared to 12.8 gigawatts by 2000, but has hinted that
this estimate might have to be upgraded in coming years."</P>

<P>"Global warming treaty not doomed, Germany says
(((Oh really!)))</P>

  <p>"BERLIN. Germany's Environment Minister Juergen Trittin
  voiced cautious optimism in an interview published
  yesterday about the prospects of global climate talks to
  be held Bonn later this month.</p>
 
<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'We still have a real chance to achieve a result,'
Trittin told the Badische Zeitung newspaper. 'Although the
negotiations will be very difficult, it would be wrong to
give up too early.'</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The future of the Kyoto treaty on global warming was
thrown into question in March when U.S. President George
W. Bush rejected it saying it was 'unrealistic'. Bush
faced international criticism for his comments.   (((Kyoto
<STRONG>is</STRONG> unrealistic, but so is the daffy notion that you can
call a global accord "unrealistic" and get away with
that.)))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Bonn conference, starting in two weeks, will
discuss the way forward on the 1997 treaty which calls on
industrialised countries to trim output of carbon dioxide,
the main greenhouse gas, by average of 5.2 percent from
1990 levels by 2010.</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trittin, a Green party politician, said they still
wanted to hold the door open for the United States to
change its mind, especially as it produces a quarter of
global man-made carbon dioxide emissions.  (((Yes it does;
but Europe is no slouch either, and until Bush trashed
Kyoto, Europe was just dabbling in green.  But with a
sudden combination of booming European green power and,
perhaps, vicious American economic decline, we might see
CO2 really start to dip - not on treaty paper, but in our
actual atmosphere.)))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If both Russia and Japan ratify the agreement, as
Trittin said he thought they would, the pact would take
legal effect even without U.S. participation.  (((No doubt
VP Cheney has a fallback position for this; probably a
robust declaration that a "pact taking legal effect" is
"unrealistic.")))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In response to Japanese suggestions that the
agreement could be modified to make it more palatable to
the United States, Trittin said: "The United States is not
concerned about less harsh conditions.  It is
fundamentally against a legally binding agreement. That is
the core of the conflict between the United States and the
rest of the industrialised world."  (((Stunned by his
frankness, the Japanese stared at the German minister  in
polite astonishment, then returned to their hotel suites
to mutter into the sake.)))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Trittin said some aspects of negotiations would even
be made easier 'because special interests of the U.S. will
no longer have to be taken into account'.  (((Paging
ExxonMobil.)))</P>
