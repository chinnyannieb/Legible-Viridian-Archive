<p><strong>Key Concepts:</strong> Greenhouse effect, slowing of
  planetary rotation, lengthening of Earth's day</p>


<P><strong>Attention Conservation Notice:</strong>  Where, oh where, does the
time go?</P>

<P>(((An eager reader asks:  "Have the events of the last few
months sent the Viridian forces into a fetal curl from the
horror, the horror of it all?"  No.  During the hiatus
since Viridian Note 00295, I've visited both the Pentagon
and the World Trade Center.  If that doesn't do it for you
fetal-wise, nothing will, and that didn't do it for me.  I
wrote a long article on the military for WIRED, and I also
attended the Davos World Economic Forum, cops,
zillionaires, protesters, and all.  I've been a busy guy.
Viridian readers who wonder if the Pope is in catatonic
shock should check out this site:)))</P>

<P>"Global warming lengthens day</P>

<P>"WASHINGTON == Global warming caused by increasing manmade
carbon dioxide in the atmosphere will lengthen the day,
according to a study to be published this month by the
journal, Geophysical Research Letters.
<BR></P>

<P>"Researchers at Belgiums Royal Observatory and the
Catholic University of Louvain, Belgium, lead by Olivier
de Viron, used computer models to analyze the effect of
adding one percent more carbon dioxide to the atmosphere
each year, in order to reach a doubling of the carbon
dioxide concentration after 70 years.
<BR></P>

<P>"Scientists can currently measure the length of the day
to an accuracy of about 10 microseconds (1/100,000 of a
second). It fluctuates slightly, based primarily on
changes in atmospheric winds and ocean currents, which
affect Earth's angular momentum as it spins on its axis.
Angular momentum measures the rotation of a non-rigid
body, such as a planet, including its ability to continue
to spin. As angular momentum is conserved, the solid
Earth's rate of rotation is affected by the movement of
its nonrigid components, the ocean and atmosphere.
<BR></P>

<P>"The Belgian scientists estimated the effect of the
ocean and atmosphere, caused by increasing the amount of
atmospheric carbon dioxide by one percent per year and its
effect on global warming, on Earth's angular momentum.
This rate of increase, they note, is a common scenario,
based on current human activity. They used 14 different
computer models, obtained from the Coupled Model
Intercomparison Project, which showed reasonable
agreement, they say.
<BR></P>

<P>"They find that the length of day would increase as a
result of angular momentum changes associated with global
warming, including variations in surface pressure over
land masses, average surface pressure over the ocean, and
zonal winds and currents, that is, those moving in an
east-west or west-east direction. The amount of
lengthening would be small, on the order of microseconds
(millionths of a second) per year, and would be difficult
to distinguish in any given year from naturally occurring
variations.
<BR></P>

<P>"On a scale of decades or longer periods, though, the
effect of global warming on the length of the day would be
measurable, the researchers say. They anticipate an
increase of around 11 microseconds (11/1,000,000 of a
second) per decade in the 21st century, resulting in a
total lengthening of the day by 0.11 (11/100,000 of a
second) for the century as a whole."</P>
