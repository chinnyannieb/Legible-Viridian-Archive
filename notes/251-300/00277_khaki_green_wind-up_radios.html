<P>Attention Conservation Notice: Grim warfare coverage
includes cool Viridian T-shirts and Hindi Bollywood dance
movies!</P>

<P>(((We Viridians are not be ahead of our times at the
moment, but we can still break the tiresome rhythm of
daily events.  Normally we shy away from selling Viridian
T-shirts by mail, because it is way too much work. Never
mind that now.  This is clearly the proper moment for us
Viridians to use the mail services.</P>

<P>(((Twenty dollars will buy you our new Viridian T-shirt.
This shirt comes in two colors/ sizes, the large, Khaki
Green version, and the Xtra-Large Involuntary-Park Forest
Green model.  Both shirts bear a large white logo of our
beloved Viridian mascot, Big Mike.  They sport the address
of our website in a Viridian-approved "Decaying" font, and
brandish the catchy and accurate slogan "WE KNOW MORE
ABOUT THE GREENHOUSE EFFECT THAN YOU HAVE EVER BEEN
ALLOWED TO LEARN."</P>

<P>(((Twenty dollars is a lot for a T-shirt, but this
inflated sum will underwrite international mail for global
Viridians.  If your government is in NATO, feel free to
mail me twenty euros.  I don't know what I'll do with
these euros, but I'll think of something.  Cash and checks
only, please.  If you want one, send email and I'll give
you the full particulars.)))</P>

<P>Fiza: The Feel-Good PsyWar Hit of the Season!</P>


<P>"Fiza: In Search of Her Brother" directed by Khalid
Mohamed, starring Karisma "Lolo" Kapoor as "Fiza," and
Hrithik Roshan as "Amaan."</P>

<P>(((In this directorial debut by Indian film critic Khalid
Muhamed, Fiza is a disco-dancing, college-educated Bombay
feminist whose brother Amaan is a Mujihadeen terrorist.
This movie lasts four long hours, is all about touchy
Indian communal politics, and it's in Hindi.  As a
Viridian, you'll probably want to watch much of this epic
with your finger on the fast-forward button.  However, you
definitely will want to slow down to see former Miss
Universe Sushmita Sen do her guest-starring, hijab-
stripping, MTV-India music-video routine for the sizzling
number "Mehboob Mere."  If you are female, you will merely
gape in astonishment at this edifying cultural spectacle;
if you are male, you will probably want to watch Sushmita
do her thing four or five times in a row.)))</P>

"Clockwork warfare</P>

<P>"Afghans rely on radio more than any other medium
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It started as a few cogs and springs in the hands of
an eccentric inventor. But now the wind-up radio is a
secret weapon in America's battle for the Afghan airwaves,
writes BBC News Online's Jonathan Duffy.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's a battle for the air and the airwaves.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As well as dropping bombs and food ration packs into
Afghanistan, military strategists in Washington have a new
secret weapon in their war on terrorism: the wind-up
radio.</P>

<P>"American C17 planes have been making drops into
Afghanistan
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Americans have reportedly been air-dropping
hundreds of small wind-up radios into Afghanistan as the
first step in what promises to be a battle for the hearts
and minds of the Afghan people.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The radios are thought to be specially commissioned
fixed-frequency models that will automatically tune into
information broadcasts issued by the US military.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Washington is relying on the work of its renowned
Commando Solo unit to reach Afghans over the airwaves, and
maybe also to block out rival broadcasts by the Taleban,
according to an expert.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The six EC-130 planes that make up the Air National
Guard's Commando Solo fleet serve as flying radio
stations. The unit has a record of operating in US
conflicts such as those in Panama, Bosnia and Haiti.</P>

<P>'Now the genie is out of the bottle, I only hope it is not
used for evil' Trevor Baylis, inventor of the wind-up
radio
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As well as efforts by the US military to air-drop
radios, relief agencies are also working to supply
commercial wind-up models to refugees, many of whom have
fled their homes because of severe food shortages in
Afghanistan.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Freeplay, the company which pioneered wind-up radio
technology through British inventor Trevor Baylis, says it
has recently had orders for 'tens of thousands' of radios
for the region.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But unlike those dropped by the Americans, these will
not be locked on to a single frequency and so will be able
to pick up broadcasts from independent media such as BBC's
World Service and Voice of America.</P>

<P>"Television ban
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The whole thing has Mr Baylis, who struggled for
years to get backing for his invention, quite overawed.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'To think when I was sitting there with a load of
springs and cogs and wires that one day this technology
would be used by the American military to help fight their
wars is quite astonishing,' he says. (((We Viridians have
been watching Trevor for years.  Frankly, I don't think we
find this development all that astonishing.  We'll be
particularly impressed if his <STRONG>wind-up mine detector</STRONG>
finally goes into full-scale production.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Radio is seen as a key weapon in the current
conflict, since it is one of the few forms of media
available to Afghans. The ruling Taleban forbid
television, and with high levels of illiteracy, newspapers
command only a select audience.</P>

<P>"Radios few in number
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"By contrast, a survey carried out by the BBC before
the current crisis found that on an average day more than
60% of the population listen to World Service broadcasts
in Pashto and Persian.</P>

<P>"BBC World Service:</P>

<P>"Broadcast to Afghanistan in Persian for 60 years and in
Pashto for 20 years</P>

<P>"Doubled hours of output to Afghanistan since start of
crisis
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But radios are relatively scarce and worsening poverty
combined with recent disruptions mean that fresh batteries
are both hard to find and expensive, says Kristine
Pearson, of the Freeplay Foundation.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Hence the need for wind-up radios.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Information is absolutely vital in a humanitarian
crisis,' says Ms Pearson. (((Uhhhh... okay.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'In this situation, it is even more crucial because
of the disinformation and misinformation that's rife.
These people need to be able to rely on balanced and
reliable broadcasts.' (((I know I'll heartily agree on the
day that somebody drops a renewable radio on me.)))</P>
