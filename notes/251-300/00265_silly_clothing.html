<P>"Shirt rolls up its own sleeves</P>

<P>by Paul Marks
<BR></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"A shirt which rolls up its own sleeves when you get too warm has been unveiled by a 
  tech-savvy Italian fashion house. And what's more, its inventors say it will never need 
  ironing.
  <BR></P>

  <P>"The fabric for the prototype shirt is woven from fibres of the shape-memory alloy 
  nitinol, interspersed with nylon. The alloy can be deformed, and then returned to its 
  original shape when heated to a certain temperature.
  <BR></P>

  <P>"It is this shape memory property that is key to how the 'memory metal shirt' works. 
  'The sleeve fabric is programmed to shorten as soon as the room temperature becomes a few 
  degrees hotter,' says Susan Clowes, a spokeswoman for Corpo Nove of Florence, the shirt's 
  developer. (((Oh for heaven's sake.... Nitinol isn't "programmed;" it just bends when it's 
  heated and cooled, like a thermostat strip.)))
  <BR></P>

  <P>"'Even if the fabric is screwed up into a ball, pleated and creased, a blast from a 
  hairdryer pops it back to its former shape,' Clowes says. (((Huh!))) This means the shirt 
  can be 'ironed' as you are wearing it. 'It's a travellers' dream,' she says. (((Unless 
  you're travelling in a lightning storm. Granted, though, even then, you'd probably be an 
  entertaining spectacle.)))
  <BR></P>

  <P>"(...) it is also washable and non-allergenic.
  <BR></P>

  <P>"(...) The prototype shirt cost around L2500 to make, and is available in any colour 
  you like == provided you have a tendency to wear metallic grey, that is. 'But it looks 
  distinctly bronze-coloured in some lights,' says Clowes. (((For two and a half thousand 
  pounds I hope it's tailored.)))</P>

  <P>"Under-Ease are underwear for protection against bad human gas (malodorous flatus) 
  and are made from a soft air-tight fabric (polyurethane-coated nylon)."</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>(((This is not crass Viridian schoolboy humor, ladies and gentlemen. This is about 
personal methane emissions.)))
<BR></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"A triangular 'exit hole' for the flatus to be expelled is cut from the back of the 
  air-tight underwear, near the bottom. This 'exit hole' is covered with a 'pocket'(...) 
  This unique design forces all expelled gas (flatus) out through the 'pocket'.
  <BR></P>

  <P>"Inside the 'pocket' is a high-functioning, replaceable filter == the core of the 
  technology. This multi-layered filter is made in a sandwich-style, and begins with the two 
  outer layers of wool felt. The second two layers are made of non-woven polypropylene and 
  spun glass materials. In the center of the filter is a single layer of activated carbon.
  <BR></P>

  <P>"The filter is then covered with soft ordinary material to allow for easy replacement 
  in or out of the pocket. The underwear are washable and will last approximately a year 
  depending on the frequency of use and laundering. Each filter will last from several weeks 
  to several months depending on the frequency of use and laundering."</P>

<P>"I want to be a lawn"</P>

<P>December 15, 01998</P>

<P>"BRUSSELS, Belgium (CNN) == Forget your traditional Hawaiian skirts. A Belgian 
agri-design team has headed to greener pastures with clothing made of living grass.
<BR></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"Agricultural technician Luc Mertes, a self-styled flower sculptor, came up with the 
  idea of making == or , rather, growing == the skirts, dresses and tops.
  <BR></P>

  <P>"Mertes did it for fun. (((Well then.))) He says he has a passion for decorating 
  anything == or anybody == with living flowers and plants. (((Come on, give a little, it's 
  a harmless hobby.)))
  <BR></P>

  <P>"'Everybody wants to touch the grass clothes just to see if it is made of truly 
  natural grass. The comments from most people aren't very kind. (((Oh dear.))) But it's a 
  good laugh. People always want to see if it's real. Someone even took a bit of grass to 
  taste it == just to check that it was real.'
  <BR></P>

  <P>"The grass is grown on jute matting, which substitutes for soil. It takes about 25 
  days for the 'material' to be ready for cutting, roots and all.
  <BR></P>

  <P>"Then fashion designer Christiane Libert takes over, 'Edward Scissorhands' style. She 
  says there's nothing like these clothes.
  <BR></P>

  <P>"'I wear them myself. It feels very comfortable, very light and fresh because 
  normally, the grass has been watered.'
  <BR></P>

  <P>"But the eco-garb is high-maintenance! If it isn't watered once a day, it dies. And a 
  dress may need mowing every two weeks. Of course, a local horse may be available to help 
  out in that department. (...) (((It's all downhill from there.)))</P>
