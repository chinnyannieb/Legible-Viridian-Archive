<P>"In Hazy, Humid Houston, the Mosquitoes Are Winning Big.</P>



<P>By JIM YARDLEY</P>



<P>"HOUSTON, June 21 == Clarence Watkins, a head lineman for

Reliant Energy, the local utility, considers himself at

war.

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He works in the afternoon and evening == what might

be described as mosquito prime time in this city still

recovering from huge rains and flooding == and defends

himself with a style of slapping and leg-kicking akin to

Irish line dancing.

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'I've got a long-sleeve shirt and two good slapping

arms,' said Mr. Watkins, 37. 'It's like 300 of them and

one of you. It's like fighting a small army. You can hear

them. You know they are coming.'  (((The Viridian aspect?

They're eating this guy because he repairs storm-damaged

power lines for a fossil-fueled energy company.)))</P>



<P>"First came the rains. Now the mosquitoes.</P>





<P>"They are everywhere, a swarm of science-fiction-like

proportions  (((hello!))) spawned by the torrential rains

and flooding here wrought earlier this month by Tropical

Storm Allison. The flooding caused an estimated $4.88

billion in local property damage  (((Hear that?  $4.88 big

ones.  Whoa.)))   that may take months or longer to

repair. It has also raised long-range questions about

whether this city encircled by bayous must rethink its

readiness for huge amounts of rainfall.  (((It's almost

too good:  "Moats and Dikes Surround Fossil Fuel Capital

Of The World.")))

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But, really, the main topic of conversation is

mosquitoes. There are about 3.1 million people in Houston

and surrounding Harris County. Officials say hundreds of

millions of mosquitoes may have taken flight since the

flood. (...)

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In this, one of the nation's most hermetically

sealed cities, no place is completely mosquito-free: They

have been spotted in the air-conditioned pedestrian

tunnels that run beneath downtown and inside the city's

skyscrapers.

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'I work on the 27th floor, and I don't know how a

mosquito got up there,' said Roland Esparza, 42, who was

bitten twice inside his office.  (..)

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bugs are not exactly a new phenomenon to Houston.

Heat, humidity and rainfall  == mother's milk to much of

the insect world == are found in abundance here.  The

cockroaches are big enough to frighten small children.

Hardware stores stock pesticides the way drug stores stock

aspirin. The world's first indoor stadium, the Astrodome,

was built as a refuge from the heat and mosquitoes of the

city's summers. The area's most powerful politician,

Representative Tom DeLay, the House majority whip, began

his career as an exterminator.

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In all, 55 species of mosquitoes call Houston home,

and even under normal conditions man often wages a losing

battle against them. But this outbreak is the worst in

memory, said Dr. Ray Parsons, head of Harris County

Mosquito Control.(...)

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"To measure the problem, the control board dispatched

inspectors and 'surveillance specialists' to stand like

scarecrows beneath trees and wait for 60 seconds. Then,

each inspector and specialist counted the number of

mosquitoes that landed on their body.

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Anything more than 25 landings every 60 seconds is

considered bad; some inspectors reported rates exceeding

100 landings a minute. (...)

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If there is good news, it is that no cases of

disease have been reported, as happened in New York last

year when mosquitoes carried the West Nile Virus.

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Still, Houston officials declared the mosquitoes a

health hazard this week based on their sheer numbers, and

after complaints from hospitals at the sprawling Texas

Medical Center, about three miles from downtown.  Many of

the hospitals suffered basement flooding and power outages

and had to open their windows to dry out or catch a

breeze. The mosquitoes flew right in."  (((Nice tight

feedback loop there.)))</P>



<P><BR>

(((Here's a useful bill for the damages.)))</P>

<P>"Allison's price tag tops $4.88 billion

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The price tag on Tropical Storm Allison's damage in

Harris County is estimated at $4.88 billion, county

officials said Tuesday. (((That's Texas alone.)))

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With an estimated repair bill of nearly $2 billion,

the Texas Medical Center suffered the greatest loss, said

Jim Robinson, chief appraiser for the Harris County

Appraisal District. The Medical Center == the world's

largest health-care complex, with about 40 institutions ==

accounted for most of the total estimated damage of $2.04

billion at the county's public facilities, including

hospitals.

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Residential properties, including apartments,

sustained about $1.76 billion damage, according to

estimates made by the appraisal district and Harris County

Emergency Management, Robinson said.

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Estimated damage to the county's businesses is $1.08

billion.

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"An estimated 2,744 homes and 696 mobile homes were

destroyed.

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Homes with major damage were numbered at 9,492,

plus one mobile home.  In all, 43,269 Harris County

residences suffered some damage."  (((Hope they didn't

lose their mosquito screens.)))</P>



<P><BR>

(((Weak little Allison barely made official "Tropical

Storm" status, but there was no  stopping it.  It killed

people in Texas, Louisiana, Florida, North Carolina,

Virginia, Pennsylvania, and finally flooded New

England.)))</P>

<P>"Allison puts imprint on North Carolina

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The remnants of Tropical Storm Allison dumped rain on

North Carolina on Thursday(...)  Flash flood warnings were

posted Thursday for eastern North Carolina, where

forecasters were predicting as much as 6 inches of rain in

some areas.

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Rain fell fast, about 2 inches in less than an hour

Wednesday, and power outages affected more than 6,000

homes in the area around Salisbury, about 40 miles north

of Charlotte.  (...) Allison, the Atlantic's first

tropical storm of 2001, is blamed for killing 22 people in

Texas last week as it stalled after coming ashore, dumping

nearly 3 feet of rain on some areas. Nine people died in

Florida, including five who drowned in choppy water

stirred up off the Florida Panhandle.

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On Wednesday, Georgia Gov. Roy Barnes declared a

state of emergency for 14 eastern Georgia counties left

awash in 8 inches of rain that fell Tuesday.  The storm

system also brought heavy rain to South Carolina on

Tuesday and Wednesday, but not enough to end a statewide

drought."</P>

<P>"Last traces of Allison inundate parts of New England

Associated Press

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"BOSTON == The last traces of Tropical Storm Allison

swept through New England, dropping up to 7 inches of

rain, flooding roads and knocking out electricity.

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meanwhile, authorities said two bodies were found

Monday in a Pennsylvania apartment complex devastated by

flooding and a storm-related fire, bringing Allison's

death toll to 47.

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Flooding created problems for drivers on just about

all of Massachusetts' major highways (...)

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'I woke up, and I had two swimming pools in my back

yard, one that has a lot of chemicals and one that has a

lot of mud,' Dennis Garafolo of South Windsor, Conn., told

WFSB-TV of Hartford.   (((What a wonderfully Greenhouse

thing to say.)))

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As the storm moved up the Eastern Seaboard, parts of

New Jersey received more than 5 1/2 inches of rain, while

7.2 inches of rainfall were recorded in Pomfret, Conn.,

and nearly 5 inches fell in Wellesley, Mass., officials

said.

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'This was not an easy storm to forecast,'  said

meteorologist Neal Strauss of the National Weather Service

in Taunton.   (((Uh, yeah.)))

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(...)  "In Pennsylvania, which received more than 10

inches of rain over the weekend, six deaths were linked to

the storm.  Firefighters on Saturday rescued about 30

residents from the flooded Village Green apartments in

Hatboro, 16 miles north of Philadelphia.   (...)  A

natural-gas explosion and fire struck one building in the

complex, and the rising waters prevented firefighters from

battling the flames. Four bodies were found in that

building Sunday and two on Monday, authorities said.

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'We think that everything was caused by the flood

initially,' said Upper Moreland Police Chief William

Moffett. 'It appears that the water damage caused a gas

leak somewhere, which caused the fire. And the deaths

apparently were fire deaths.'"   (((This is a classic,

pocket-sized Wexelblat disaster:  they were flooded out by

storms  while being roasted by fossil fuels.)))

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Allison made landfall in Texas on June 6 and quickly

weakened. But rainfall totals soared as it lingered, first

over Texas and Louisiana, forcing thousands from their

homes and causing at least 22 deaths in the two states.

As it crept eastward along the Gulf Coast and up the East

Coast, nine deaths in Florida and seven traffic deaths in

North Carolina were attributed to the storm.  A tree

toppled in waterlogged ground, killing a woman in Virginia

Beach, Va., on Saturday, officials said."</P>

to Richmond, Sugar Land and other area towns. 'When I stop

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(...)  Precinct 4 Commissioner Ed Rinehart and

Precinct 1 Commissioner Mike Meador said crews are

spraying daily from the roadways, but the pests are

hatching in unreachable, flooded forests.   (((Can't

spray; too much rain.)))

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(...)  "In Chambers County's salty marshes,

inspectors counted up to 200 mosquito landings per minute

== sometimes recorded as 'too numerous to count.'

<P>"Mosquitoes bugging Medical Center

Officials say pests are a health hazard

By KATHRYN A. WOLFE,  Houston Chronicle

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After suffering severe property damage from flooding,

the Texas Medical Center is now under attack by so many

mosquitoes that the city is expected to declare the pests

a health hazard and approve an emergency infusion of cash

to get rid of them. (...)

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The action was prompted mostly by Medical Center

officials' complaints about the mosquitoes that have

invaded hospitals and impeded construction work.

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dr. Ralph Feigin, president of Baylor College of

Medicine and an infectious diseases specialist, said no

mosquitoes have been identified as carrying the deadly St.

Louis encephalitis, but the sheer number of mosquitoes

creates a health hazard.

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Any mosquito that comes into contact with sewage-

drenched floodwaters can infect humans with several

diseases, he said.   (((That's rather interesting:

mosquito-borne diseases direct from flood-burst sewers.)))

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(...) Feigin said mosquitoes are swarming inside

hospitals that have opened their doors and windows to air

out flooded areas. (((Flying, contaminated sewage

mosquitos right in your hospital bed!)))</P>



<P>(((Where's the emergency relief money?  Surprise!  Thanks

to Allison, the USA ran out of it!)))</P>



<P>"Senators reinstate FEMA funding

By KAREN MASTERSON,  Houston Chronicle Washington Bureau</P>





<P>"WASHINGTON == The Senate moved quickly Thursday to

restore $389 million the House had cut a day earlier from

the disaster relief fund Texans are using to recover from

Tropical Storm Allison.

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Senate appropriators from both parties said the cost

of the storm in Texas alone would drain the nation's

natural-disaster account. (...)

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Senate's action stood in stark contrast to that

of the House == where flood-relief funding became a

political football in a partisan game that pit Houston-

area Democrats, who opposed cutting the disaster money,

against Republicans, who said Congress could restore the

money later.   (((Perhaps they can save money by re-using

the partisan Kyoto football as the partisan Disaster

football.)))

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In the ornate appropriations meeting room ==

decorated with sparkling chandeliers and frescoes from

floor to ceiling ==  senators talked of Houston's

devastation and mosquito infestation 1,400 miles away.

(((You've got to love this sensitive touch of Beltway

decor.)))

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(...)  The panel agreed that FEMA's budget is in

trouble.   'We think Allison could take every single

nickel out of FEMA, and yet we're at the beginning of our

hurricane season,'  said Sen. Barbara Mikulski, a Maryland

Democrat.

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(((And then there's the final Texan fillip:  Argentine

fire ants.)))</P>



<BLOCKQUOTE>

</BLOCKQUOTE>



<P>"Most fire ants survive flood with vengeance

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Floodwaters do not drown significant numbers of fire

ants. Instead the colonies form a ball or ribbon, float,

and flow with the water until they find land. As

floodwaters recede, these floating colonies will get onto

anything that they contact.

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This means that piles of debris or items from

flooded homes are extremely inviting to fire ants. At this

time, a general treatment for controlling the fire ants is

out of the question. Each colony has to be dealt with on a

site-by-site basis.

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"If you spot fire ants, follow these tips:

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Be cautious. Be aware that fire ants will be under

almost anything. When you pick up debris, pay attention to

what is on or in it == especially if the debris has been

sitting in one place for two to three days. Fire ants love

to get under furniture, carpet strips, old wood, and re-

establish their colonies.

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Protect yourself. Wear gloves, longsleeve shirts,

long pants, socks and shoes. Spray insect repellent onto

your shoes and lower pants leg. If you are using shovels

or other tools, spread talcum powder on the handle. Fire

ants cannot climb onto the powder-coated surface. (...)

<BR></P>



<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Treat a fire ant sting like a puncture wound. Use a

good antibiotic cream to help prevent secondary

infections. The fire ant venom is very complex, and many

people may be allergic to it. After you are stung, if you

notice a shortness of breath, unusual swelling of the

sting area, or feel nauseous, see a doctor.</P>
