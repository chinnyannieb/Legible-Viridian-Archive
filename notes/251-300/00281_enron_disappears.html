others).</P>

Enron handled about a quarter of all energy trades.

by JAMES O. GOLDSBOROUGH /  THE SAN DIEGO UNION-TRIBUNE</P>

<P>"Free-marketeer Enron hits the skids</P>

<P>"November 5, 2001</P>

<P>"Last June, the California State Senate asked energy
suppliers such as Enron Corp. to open their books so
examiners could determine whether they had been
manipulating prices. Enron refused, stating that it was a
Texas, not a California company.
</p>

<P>"Enron's argument had some logic. After all, wasn't
the whole point of deregulation to get the government to
butt out? But the argument was disingenuous because
deregulation created national markets which meant Enron
had ceased to be a purely Texas company, and Californians
had a right to know about its pricing practices.
</p>

<P>"The state Senate was stiffed, and now we are finding
out why. Since June, Enron has gone from being the driving
force behind deregulation, the unstoppable top dog on the
energy hill, the company with a very big friend in the
White House, to a company in deep trouble.
</p>

<P>"Enron is under investigation by the Securities and
Exchange Commission, has had its debt downgraded by
Moody's, has lost its CEO and CFO and has seen its stock
fall off a cliff. At $80 last year, Enron's share price
closed last week near $11.
</p>

<P>"The company's shenanigans are complex, but all seem
related to the fatal flaw of deregulation: secrecy and
lack of oversight. Not only did Enron not want
Californians to see its books, it didn't want anyone to
see them.
</p>

<P>"This tactic may work well enough for selling
shoelaces, but when a company deals in electricity, the
product that makes things go, people want the facts. No
state will hand over control of its electricity to
unaudited price manipulators.  (((That's why you want to
skip right over mere states like California, and own the
feds.)))
</p>

<P>"Kenneth Lay, Enron's chairman, who has resumed
control of the company with the resignation of CEO Jeffrey
Skilling,  has been a leading advocate of deregulation.
His views found their way onto the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission and through FERC to the California
Public Utilities Commission, which oversaw deregulation in
California. ((("His views found their way" &mdash; hey, that's
nicely phrased.)))
</p>

<P>"Thus when California's energy crisis began in the
spring of 2000, FERC did nothing. When spot energy market
prices hit $2 per kilowatt hour last spring &mdash; 50 times
the normal price, FERC still did nothing.  (((California
went for Gore.)))
</p>

<P>"Some FERC members wavered as prices soared, but
deregulation was given such a strong boost by the Bush
administration's energy policy (strongly influenced by
Lay, who was the largest single contributor to the Bush
campaign) that nothing was done. Pacific Gas &amp; Electric
declared bankruptcy, Southern California Edison faced
bankruptcy, and some wondered if the state government
would not go bankrupt paying electricity bills.
(((Remember those times, Californians?  I rather hope you
do, as you still owe something along the line of $10
billion.)))
</p>

<P>"Lay and Skilling were talented political pitchmen who
claimed they were doing God's work. 'We're on the side of
the angels,' said Skilling when Californians accused Enron
of profiteering. Lay, visiting California in February,
said God was on the side of free markets and the profit
motive.
</p>

<P>"California's problems were caused, Lay said, by
'very flawed' deregulation. Why did our prices soar 100
times?  'We see this in other commodity markets,' he
replied breezily. (...)
</p>

<P>"Until someone has a thorough look at Enron's books
&mdash; even Andersen, its auditor, apparently missed the
manipulations &mdash; it's impossible to know the connection
between Enron's core business, which is energy trading,
and the company's slide. Lay's philosophy of deregulation
apparently reached so deep into the company that not even
common corporate disclosure requirements were met."
(((Well, no, not really. This is hokum.   Enron wasn't
that badly exposed in the California market.  The real
problem is that Enron's Chief Financial Officer bought his
way into way too many  dotcom companies.  It made no sense
to just <STRONG>leave the cash sitting there</STRONG> when all those
stock valuations were going ape, so the CFO took Enron's
fossil-fuel money and sank it into a bunch of digital
stuff that looked sure to skyrocket.  It worked great, for
a while.  He resigned last October.)))
</p>

<P>"Last year, Enron's revenues reached $100 billion (a
250 percent increase over 1999), and this year's second
quarter earnings were up 40 percent over last. But last
month, the company revealed a $600 million third quarter
loss and a mysterious $1.2 billion loss of shareholder
equity related to partnership deals worked out by its
former CFO, Andrew Fastow.  (((A hundred billion dollar
company, dead in one month... sold off in indecent haste
for a lousy 8 billion.)))
</p>

<P>"The SEC, Wall Street analysts, bond-rating agencies
and shareholders are besieging and beseeching the company,
and Lay is lying low. The fear is that Enron has billions
of dollars in off-balance sheet debt that may or may not
be related to its core business of energy trading.
</p>

<P>(((This would be just another sad case of dotcom
overreach, and a pity in some ways because Enron really
was very innovative in an industry that needs that sorely.
But Kenneth Lay of Enron is also the chief architect of
the Bush energy policy. This scandal is potentially
devastating, or it would be, if Enron was still around to
absorb heat.  With its stock down almost 90%, its
credibility in tatters, and no one to blame but Ken, Enron
is hastily ceasing to exist.
</p>

<P>(((Henceforth Enron will be known as "Dynegy," if,
that is, that merger and acquisition can pass muster at
the Justice Department.  That Dynegy/Enron trust looks
nothing like a "free market", but consider the sweet deal
Microsoft got.  The current Justice Department will fall
all over themselves for the scandal-blazing hulk of Enron.
Assuming, that is, that Dynegy itself doesn't collapse as
well, before the deal goes through.)))</P>

<P>"Dynegy to buy Enron for $7.8 billion
By Lisa Sanders, CBS.MarketWatch.com</P>

<P>"Last Update: 8:24 PM ET Nov. 9, 2001</P>

<P>"HOUSTON (CBS.MW) &mdash; Enron Corp. on Friday agreed to sell
itself to smaller rival Dynegy Inc. for the firesale price
of $7.8 billion in stock, halting one of the steepest and
most sudden corporate downfalls in Wall Street history.
</p>

<P>"Dynegy also said it would immediately give Enron $1.5
billion in equity to help stabilize the troubled power
merchant. The deal, which requires Dynegy to assume $15
billion of debt, comes with a $350 million breakup fee.
</p>

<P>"The announcement ended a week in which Enron's (ENE:
news, chart, profile) shares fell sharply and it announced
it would restate earnings for four years and two quarters.
</p>

<P>"In a conference call, Enron Chairman and Chief
Executive Kenneth Lay said the deal, which he admitted he
couldn't have envisioned a month ago, was necessary to get
the investment community refocused on Enron's core
operations &mdash; wholesale trading and retail energy
services.
</p>

<P>"'This is an enormously strong combination,' he said.
'This is the best alternative for our shareholders, our
employees... and for Houston.' (((And for the Bush
Administration, and for the Arctic drilling....)))</P>

<P>"Terms of the deal
</p>

<P>"Houston-based Dynegy (DYN: news, chart, profile),
with a market capitalization of about $13 billion, said it
would pay $10.40 a share for Enron. (...) In the call,
Dynegy said it didn't immediately expect to layoff
employees. (((How nice.)))  The companies hope to close
the deal in the next six to nine months, and don't expect
'significant' regulatory hurdles. (((Well, uh, no.)))
</p>

<P>"ChevronTexaco (((Chevron and Texaco used to be two
different companies, too, just a little while ago))) plans
to invest $2.5 billion in new equity into Dynegy to
support the deal. It already owns 27 percent of Dynegy.
(...)
</p>

<P>"Together, Dynegy and Enron would dwarf rival natural
gas and power marketers in the U.S with revenue of more
than $200 billion a year and $90 billion in assets.</P>

<P>"How things have changed  (((And how...)))
</p>

<P>"Glen Hilton, portfolio manager for the Montgomery New
Power Fund, said that the deal would have been
inconceivable 12 months ago.
</p>

<P>"'Dynegy stands to become the dominant player in the
energy trading market,' he said. 'Dynegy isn't going to do
a dumb deal, and they know their own investors would tell
them if they were making a mistake.'  (((Just like the
investors told Enron about Enron's mistakes?)))
</p>

<P>(...) "Hilton had predicted that Lay wouldn't be
involved in the day-to-day operations of the combined
company because he was trying to remove himself from that
role at Enron. (((And because Ken now glows in the
dark.)))  Lay had to step in as CEO after Jeffrey Skilling
abruptly resigned in August after six months on the job.
Skilling cited 'personal reasons' for his departure.
</p>

<P>"'At best, Lay will have a board seat,' Hilton said.
Lay said he's been asked to join the board, but wouldn't
be involved in the management of the new company.
</p>

<P>"Shares of both companies closed higher Friday.
Enron's stock is off close to 90 percent since it reached
a 52-week high of $84.88 on Dec. 29.
</p>

<P>"Analyst concerns
</p>

<P>"When talks of the merger surfaced this week, analysts
expressed surprise, citing Dynegy's size compared to Enron
(((Dynegy is one third Enron's size))) and Dynegy's own
debt load, which totals $3 billion. (((Maybe they'll
<STRONG>both</STRONG> go broke, which would really make a fantastic Texan
wheeler-dealer spectacle.))) Market players said the deal
would only make sense if Dynegy intended to unload Enron's
non-core assets such as its water business, Azurix, and
its power plant in India. (((And while you're at it, guys,
stop raiding California.)))
</p>

<P>"'Enron has limited options if the credit markets
won't extend additional credit and their trading partners
won't trade with them,' said Paul Fremont, an electric
utility analyst with Jefferies &amp; Co. (((Well, yeah; if you
smell so bad that no one will even talk to you, you're
sunk.)))
</p>

<P>"Market players told CBS.MarketWatch.com on Thursday
that trading counterparties had begun to limit their
exposure to Enron.  (((It's global capitalism at its
finest...  "You own the President of the USA?  Who
cares?")))
</p>

<P>"Fremont said he would be concerned about the merger
if he held shares of Dynegy.
</p>

<P>"'It's an added risk for Dynegy shareholders unless
the company figures out some way to unwind the (off-
balance sheet) obligations,' he said. 'I would be very
concerned that adding such a high level of risk won't be
offset by the potential profitability of the transaction.'</P>

<P>"How Enron unraveled
</p>

<P>"Enron's saga began in earnest on October 16,
(((That's not even <STRONG>one month</STRONG> ago! The thing's flown
apart like a tissue-paper pinata!)))  though serious
questions about the company surfaced far before then.
Investors continually voiced concerns about Enron's
failing broadband business and the Dabhol power plant
project in India. Skilling's departure caused an outcry in
the investment community.
</p>

<P>"One of the ongoing complaints of analysts was Enron's
unwillingness to provide details about how the company
makes money.  ((("We buy politicians cheap, and we sell
them high."))) When Lay reclaimed the CEO role, he
promised more information would be forthcoming.
</p>

<P>"On Oct. 16, Enron reported a third-quarter net loss
and said it took a $1 billion charge to write off bad
investments.
</p>

<P>"The following day, Enron disclosed that it took a
$1.2 billion equity reduction to unwind transactions by
two limited partnerships created and run by former Chief
Financial Officer Andy Fastow. (((That'd be Andy "Fast
Andy" Fastow, "The Guy Who Broke Enron.")))
</p>

<P>"The next week, Enron announced that the Securities
and Exchange Commission had launched an informal inquiry
into the partnerships. The inquiry seeks to find out
whether Enron adequately disclosed information about the
transactions and the partnerships. More than a dozen
shareholder lawsuits have been filed as a result.
</p>

<P>"Following the revelation, Enron fired Fastow and
replaced him with former treasurer Jeff McMahon.
Subsequently, the SEC elevated the inquiry into a formal
investigation and moved the case from Fort Worth, Texas to
its headquarters in Washington, D.C. The SEC sent letters
to Enron in 1998 and 1999 raising questions about the
company's accounting and disclosure practices.  (((When is
the fossil fuel industry going to get around to buying the
SEC?  This outfit is a real drag.)))
</p>

<P>"Moody's Investors Service, Standard &amp; Poor's and
Fitch downgraded Enron's credit ratings, respectively, and
Moody's took further action Friday.  ((('Tis the very
knell of business death.)))
</p>

<P>"Earlier in the week, Enron was seeking a capital
infusion of at least $2 billion from a multitude of
sources before Dynegy stepped in. (((Doin' the dotbomb
cringe.))) Also this week, Skilling was called by subpoena
to testify in Washington, D.C., though the SEC would not
confirm that it was talking to him.
</p>

<P>"On Thursday, Enron disclosed in an SEC filing that it
had fired two officers and would restate its earnings for
the years 1997 to 2000 and the first two quarters of 2001.
In the call, Watson said he wasn't concerned about
additional disclosures from Enron. Lay said Enron would
have a conference call next Wednesday to discuss off-
balance sheet partnerships.</P>

<P>"Press Release
DYNEGY AND ENRON ANNOUNCE MERGER AGREEMENT
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: Friday, November 9, 2001</P>

<P>"HOUSTON (Nov. 9, 2001) &mdash; Dynegy Inc. (NYSE: DYN) and
Enron Corp. (NYSE: ENE) today announced the execution of a
definitive agreement for a merger of the two companies.
The combined company, to be called Dynegy Inc., will be
headquartered in Houston, Texas.</P>

<P>(((The new baseball stadium in Houston is named "Enron
Field."  What are they gonna do with it now? Poor
Houston... Compaq crushed, Continental Airlines broke from
9.11, now Enron in flames, not to mention their
catastrophic flood and that evil horde of Greenhouse
mosquitos.... The Queen of Fossil Fuels is snakebitten.)))
</p>

<P>"The new company will focus on the core businesses of
North American and European wholesale energy markets and
commercial and industrial energy users, and will
capitalize on the opportunities generated by the combined
company's diversified asset-backed network supported by
the strongest intellectual capital in the industry. ((("We
embezzle a little money every time we use our intellectual
capital, but we make it up in volume.")))
</p>

<P>(...) "The boards of both companies have unanimously
approved the transaction, and ChevronTexaco, which owns
approximately 26 percent of Dynegy's outstanding common
stock, has agreed to invest a total of $2.5 billion into
Dynegy.
</p>

<P>"Chuck Watson, chairman and chief executive officer of
Dynegy Inc., Steve Bergstrom, president of Dynegy Inc.,
and Rob Doty, chief financial officer of Dynegy Inc., will
retain those positions in the combined company. Greg
Whalley, the current president and chief operating officer
of Enron Corp., will become an executive vice president of
the new Dynegy. These executives will comprise the Office
of the Chairman upon merger completion. (((We win, you
chumps lose, now get lost.)))
</p>

<P>"The board of directors of the combined company will
be comprised of 14 members. Dynegy's 11 designees will
include three from ChevronTexaco. Enron will have the
right to designate a minimum of three board members.
(((Enron: 3/14ths of a company one third its size.)))
</p>

<P>"Chuck Watson, chairman and chief executive officer of
Dynegy Inc., said, '(((Blather blather "strategic" blather
"existing core business" blather  "strong marketing,
trading" blather  "technology infrastructure" blather
"global energy" blather "competitive markets"))) WE WILL
KEEP A STRONG BALANCE SHEET AND STRAIGHTFORWARD FINANCIAL
STRUCTURE AS KEY PRIORITIES.'
</p>

<P>"Kenneth L. Lay, chairman and chief executive officer
of Enron Corp., (((He's gray... weary... tugging the
chains of Marley before Scrooge...)))  said, 'The merger
protects Enron's core franchise.(...) The company we are
creating will have a strong balance sheet.(...) It also
will solidify Houston's position as the energy capital of
the world and join two companies with deep roots in the
Houston community.(...) Both companies have talented,
dedicated people and share a commitment to the safe
operation of our facilities and to the environment.'  (((A
moment of silent pity here.  Enron wasn't as bad as any
coal company.  Enron sold natural gas and they tried to
build a cleaner, faster fossil biz.  And Ken does mean
this sort of thing; last year, Ken bought $123.4 million
in stock in his own outfit.  Unless he dumped it, Ken must
be feeling pretty broke right now.  And without good old
Ken around &mdash; this is the burning question for America &mdash;
who is gonna tell George W. what to do?)))</P>

<P>"The New Dynegy
</p>

<P>"Upon completion of the merger, the new Dynegy is
expected to have revenues exceeding $200 billion and $90
billion in assets. Together, the companies have gas sales
of approximately 40 billion cubic feet per day through the
third quarter of 2001 and power sales exceeding 500
million megawatt hours through the third quarter of 2001.
In addition, the new Dynegy's delivery network will
include more than 22,000 megawatts of generating capacity
and 25,000 miles of pipelines. (...)  (((This is no idle
matter, ladies and gentlemen: it's a giant, continent-
crossing machine.)))</P>

<P>"Accounting</P>


<P>"The business combination will be accounted for as a
purchase of Enron by Dynegy. (((So much for the cornball
pretense that this is a "merger.")))</P>

<P>(...)</P>

<P>"Conference Call Simulcast</P>

<P>"Dynegy and Enron will simulcast a merger conference call
