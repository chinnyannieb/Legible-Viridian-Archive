<P>Attention Conservation Notice:  It's the latest
in our continuing series of Viridian design contests.</P>

<P><BR>
When it comes to industrial graphic design,
corporate logos are the big stinkin' deal.
Logo design is about public perception,
brand management, global recognition,
corporate goodwill and such!</P>

<P>Enron, for instance, used this keen e-commerce
"E", all canted at a dynamic angle.  It's known
as the "fanciful E."</P>

<P>The Enron "E" is nowhere near so cool as that fantastic BP
sunflower redesign, but it's not too bad for a gas
pipeline company.
<BR></P>

<P>When companies merge, or change names, or even re-org,
a logo redesign is very often job one.  But when companies
<STRONG>croak</STRONG> in a grotesque welter of scandal and bankruptcy,
nobody does a thing about the logo!
<BR></P>

<P><STRONG>Dead</STRONG> companies don't even <STRONG>get</STRONG> new logos.</P>

<P>Link:
<A HREF="http://www.enron-dynegy-stock-information.com/">http://www.enron-dynegy-stock-information.com/</A>
<BR></P>

<P>However, we Viridians, with our wise "Embrace Decay"
principle, can see through this serious organizational
shortcoming in contemporary capitalism!  And if anybody
needs a new logo right now, it's Enron.
<BR></P>

<P>Therefore our new Viridian Design Contest.  You must
design a brand-new logo for Enron that accurately reflects
Enron's current market position, global brand and public
image!
<BR></P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>I wish I could promise you that someone within Enron<BR>
was actually going to <STRONG>adopt</STRONG> this new Viridian  logo ==<BR>
but  I must doubt that.  I can assure you that Enron's not<BR>
real likely to sue anybody about this. This is a <STRONG>parody,</STRONG><BR>
okay? It's <STRONG>protected speech.</STRONG>   It's not like we're<BR>
making any money out of infringing the trademark.<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<P>Besides, Enron already has its hands full suing Dynegy
for abandoning Enron at the altar.
<BR></P>

<P>Nevertheless, there's a heady promise of wealth for</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>the Viridian guy or gal who wins this design contest.<BR>
Because the grand prize for this contest == the *most<BR>
generous prize that we Viridians have ever offered* == is:<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<HR NOSHADE ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="59%">

<P><U>ONE HUNDRED SHARES OF ENRON STOCK!!</U><BR>
<BR></P>

<P>That's right, ladies and gentlemen!  Life is tough
for graphic designers in today's market crunch.
It's time the Viridian Movement pitched in with some
hard-nosed practical support!
<BR></P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>Those 100 Enron shares  == generously donated to our<BR>
cause by a Viridian patron of the arts, Mr. Chris<BR>
Nakashima-Brown &lt;<A HREF="mailto:nakashima_brown@yahoo.com">nakashima_brown@yahoo.com</A>?&gt;<BR>
== would very recently have been worth over *eight<BR>
thousand dollars!*  Of course, at the moment they're worth<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<P>about eighty-seven bucks, not counting the transactional
overhead involved in our acquiring them.
<BR></P>

<P>But consider this.  This really, truly is a hundred
share interest in Enron, once the seventh largest company
in the FORTUNE 500 with yearly revenues of a hundred
billion dollars.  Stampeding market panic may have driven
the share-price down to pennies, but  Enron's baseball
stadium has got to be worth more than that, not to mention
its posh corporate headquarters in climate-blasted
Houston, and its physical network of gas pipelines, which
are still in very busy daily use.
<BR></P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>Dynegy may have scrammed off in terror, but Shell == a<BR>
Viridian darling == is said to be sniffing around the<BR>
corpse to acquire anything handy.  Plus == who knows,<BR>
maybe Dick Cheney will bail Enron out for national<BR>
security reasons!  Even if that stock pops to just five<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<P>bucks, you could make some serious money here!
<BR></P>

<P>It seems pretty likely that the great and the good</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>are gonna have to do  <STRONG>something</STRONG> about Enron, because,<BR>
politically, this scandal is about a million times worse<BR>
than Whitewater == and Whitewater fed whole tribes of<BR>
black spin-doctors for something like ten solid years.<BR></P>

Henry Waxman letter at:

<BR></P>

<P>"Representative Henry A. Waxman, Ranking Minority
Member with the House Committee on Government Reform wrote
a letter to Cheney December 4, 2001 stating he would like
Cheney, 'to release information about secret contacts your
energy task force had with Enron Corporation, which filed
for bankruptcy on December 2, 2001...'" etc etc etc.
<BR></P>

<P>Hoo boy!  We may be talking years of classic Beltway
Americana!
<BR></P>

<P>But that's not all!  Even if Enron stock turns out to
be worth absolutely <STRONG>nothing,</STRONG> Mr Nakashima-Brown, a
connoisseur of stock scrip design, has generously arranged
for the winner of this Viridian contest  to receive:</P>

<HR NOSHADE ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="62%">

<P><U>An Authentic ENRON Stock Certificate!</U><BR>
<BR></P>

<P>This handsome hard-copy document formally attests to
your partial ownership of the Enron company.  These
certificates are themselves hotly desired collectibles!</P>

<BR></P>

<P>One final note.  Normally, Viridian design contests
promise the reward of a Viridian star &lt;*&gt; for every
entrant.  I would love to pursue that fine Viridian
tradition, but we may have conclusively outgrown our
Viridian  Ranking System.  After that last Viridian Note
on geeks and spooks, we got Slashdotted.
<BR></P>

<P>This is no longer a small, cozy email list; we are
bigger, <STRONG>lots</STRONG> bigger.  Furthermore, if you choose to
enter a Viridian design contest nowadays (or even if some
wry remark of yours gets published to Viridian readers),
it's not uncommon  for you to get hit-on by interested
journalists.
<BR></P>

<P>So keep that in mind.  The Viridian List is groaning
at the seams.  Frankly, merely by throwing the contest,
the Pope-Emperor is courting carpal-tunnel.  It's an issue
we will seek to resolve next year.
<BR></P>

<P>If you'd care to enter this contest, create your
version of the new Enron logo, place it on the web,
and send me the URL.  I will then announce it to the list,
and at least 2,000 people will look at it.
<BR></P>

<P>This contest closes January 12, 2002.</P>
