<P>Attention Conservation Notice:  Direct from spook
wonkville; over 1,800 words</P>

<P>(((After two weeks' blissful silence from the Viridian
Vatican, a number of Viridians have asked whether I
survived my New Years' Party.  People, you should be
grateful to be spared a while.  I'm merely taking
advantage of the new millennium to upgrade my computer and
move onto a new Viridian mail server.  Two first-class
design nightmares.</P>

<P>(((Other Greens, stricken with a post-Nader hangover and
the predictably abject collapse of the Kyoto negotiations,
tentatively ask me if they should now commit ritual
seppuku.  Guys, I'm from Austin. I've been living under a
Bush government for <STRONG>years.</STRONG>)))</P>

<P>Sunday 31 December 2000</P>

<P>"This is the world in 2015
By James Langton in New York</P>

<P>"Global Trends 2015 == Central Intelligence Agency [CIA]
 
"THE world is on the brink of a new era that may resemble
the script of a James Bond film in which international
affairs are increasingly determined by large and powerful
organisations rather than governments, according to a
study just published by the CIA in Washington.  ((("Paging
Felix Leiter == it's that nice Mr Blofeld from SPECTRE on
line two."  This scenario doesn't really have much to do
with such corny high-60s fantasies... Basically, it's
about the twilight of national sovereignty and the rise of
NGOs and PoGos.  The CIA is a little worried by this.
They don't know how they're gonna get paid.)))</P>

<P>"These could include alliances between some of the most
powerful criminal groups such as the Mafia and Chinese
triads. Such groups, according to the CIA, 'will corrupt
leaders of unstable, economically fragile or failing
states, insinuate themselves into troubled banks and
businesses, and co-operate with insurgent political
movements to control substantial geographic areas'.
(((Sure they will.  Corruption really is the New
Communism.  It's got exactly the same problem as
Communism, too: a lousy means of production.  Corruption
is for hopeless, snake-bitten losers.   Any place run by a
kleptocracy goes broke and stays broke.)))</P>

<P>"The agency adds: 'Their income will come from narcotics
trafficking; aliens smuggling; trafficking in women and
children; smuggling toxic materials, hazardous wastes,
illicit arms, military technologies, and other contraband;
financial fraud; and racketeering.'  (((Sounds scary, but
this is one lousy bunch of jobs.  We're talking dope-
pushing, toxic trash and prostitution:  those are lower
than sweatshop labor.  Besides, anybody who buys "illicit
arms" from a mere gangster is a fool, when he can get top-
end NATO arms from the ever-obliging CIA.)))</P>

<P>"The 70-page report, Global Trends 2015, will be required
reading for the new president, George W Bush, and his
senior policy advisers.  (((Some of those senior policy
advisers can actually <STRONG>read</STRONG> 70-page reports.)))  (...)</P>

<P>"Compiled with help from think tanks in America and the
International Institute for Strategic Studies in London,
the report projects a future in which globalisation,
whether in the shape of the European Union, the
International Monetary Fund, giant corporations or
terrorist gangs, plays an increasing part in the lives of
ordinary people.  (((Viridianism is very much a part of
this phenomenon, even though we're merely the teensy, no-
budget, artsy version of an emergent globalized giant
corporate-terrorist gang.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Governments will have less and less control over
flows of information, technology, diseases, migrants,
arms, and financial transactions, whether licit or
illicit,' it concludes.  (((If only Iran-Contra had
succeeded, we've have an offshore, fully-globalized CIA
working right now.  It would be entirely free of any
national oversight, it would run out of secret banks, and
it would support itself by selling arms to Iraq to sow
harbor mines in Nicaragua.  Unfortunately, this Ollie
North outfit would have decayed very quickly into a simple
arms-smuggling mafia, because there is no reason at all to
play ideological patriot games when you have no national
base.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to confronting the growing economic and
military power of China and India  (((that Sino-Indian
Peril stuff sounds pretty impressive except in Tibet or
Kashmir))) and the continuing decline of Russia,  (((the
Russians are the Vanguard of Mankind in every downside
scenario))) the CIA says: 'Between now and 2015 terrorist
tactics will become increasingly sophisticated and
designed to achieve mass casualties.'  (((You might read
that statement as "formerly sophisticated national
intelligence apparats will decline to the  bush-league
level of terrorists.")))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In particular it notes the growing threat of
biological and chemical weapons and 'suitcase' nuclear
devices against the United States. (((So it's the "War on
Suitcases." Great. Compare travelling through the EU to
crossing the American border today.   With its corny paper
declarations and useless, paranoid border guards, the USA
comes across like a giant, hick Ruritania.)))</P>

<P>(...)  Elsewhere, the world population will grow by more
than one billion, to 7.2 billion, (((yike!))) most of the
increase coming in the mega-cities of the developing
world.  In Europe and Japan, an ageing population and
static birthrate means that allowing more immigration may
be the only way of meeting a chronic shortage of workers.
(((Bright news:  should be plenty of terrified refugees
around from places that aren't the G-7.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The gloomiest predictions are reserved for Africa,
where Aids, famine, and continuing economic and political
turmoil means that populations in many countries will
actually fall.  (((Incredible.  And it's not just AIDS,
but TB, malaria, Ebola, drought, and giant Mozambican
tempests.  Looks like Africa threw away its James Bond
book. It took its futurist scenario right out of Paul
Ehrlich's "Population Bomb.")))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On the other hand, there is good news on energy
supplies.  (((Sorta.)))) 'Energy resources will be
sufficient to meet demand,' the study says.  (((Unless
you're Californian.))) The CIA report is most optimistic
on the world economy, which it says has a potential for
growth not seen since the 1960s. Computer technology
represents 'the most significant global transformation
since the Industrial Revolution'.   (((Well, we've got the
traditional gray skies, sweatshops, and slums covered,
anyhow.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"At the same time, genetically modified crops will
offer the potential to improve nutrition among the world's
one billion malnourished people.   (((Why is it that <STRONG>rich
people</STRONG> never want to eat this stuff?  Let's see the Davos
Forum sit down to a tasty banquet of genetically altered
"Golden Rice.")))   China's economy will grow to overtake
Europe as the world's second largest but still behind the
United States. Russia's economy will contract to barely a
fifth of America's.  (((2015 news headline:   "Trouble
Erupts on German-Chinese Border.")))
(...)</P>

<P>"The new survey suggests a number of alternative
scenarios, none of which makes happy reading.   (((Happy
Scenario #1: CIA Abolished.)))  These include a trade war
between Europe and America, (((hokum))) and an alliance
between terrorist organisations to attack the West.
(((Okay, fine, a terrorist attack.  Then what?  It's not
like terrorists can run anything.))) Most alarming of all,
it raises the possibility of economic stagnation, followed
by America abdicating its role as the world's policeman.
((("New World Disorder."  That's all too plausible.
Nobody has any idea what a "world policeman" might look
like if it lacks a national army.)))</P>

<P>(((For extra credit, here's what the CIA has to say about
various green issues, picked out from the murk for us
courtesy of the industrious Allen Varney
(APVarney@aol.com^*).)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Contemporary environmental problems will persist and
in many instances  grow over the next 15 years. With
increasingly intensive land use,  significant degradation
of arable land will continue as will the loss of  tropical
forests. Given the promising global economic outlook,
greenhouse gas  emissions will increase substantially. The
depletion of tropical forests and  other species-rich
habitats, such as wetlands and coral reefs, will
exacerbate the historically large losses of biological
species now occurring. (...)
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some existing agreements, even when implemented, will
not be able by 2015  to reverse the targeted environmental
damage they were designed to address.  The Montreal
Protocol is on track to restore the stratospheric ozone
layer  over the next 50 years. Nevertheless, the seasonal
Antarctic ozone hole will  expand for the next two decades
== increasing the risk of skin cancer in  countries like
Australia, Argentina, and Chile == because of the long lag
time between emission reductions and atmospheric effects.
Important new  agreements will be implemented, including,
for example, a global treaty to  control the worldwide
spread of such persistent organic chemicals as DDT and
dioxins. Other agreements, such as the Convention on
Biodiversity, will fall  short in meeting their
objectives.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Over the next 15 years the pressures on the
environment as a result of  economic growth will decrease
as a result of less energy-intensive economic  development
and technological advances. For example, increased use of
fuel  cells and hybrid engines is likely to reduce the
rate of increase in the  amount of pollution produced,
particularly in the transportation sector.  Also,
increases in the utilization of solar and wind power,
advances in the efficiency of energy use, and a shift
toward less polluting fuels, such as  natural gas, will
contribute to this trend.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Global warming will challenge the international
community as indications  of a warming climate == such as
meltbacks of polar ice, sea level rise,  and increasing
frequency of major storms == occur. The Kyoto Protocol on
Climate Change, which mandates emission-reduction targets
for developed  countries, is unlikely to come into force
soon or without substantial modification. Even in the
absence of a formal treaty, however, some  incremental
progress will be made in reducing the growth of greenhouse
gas emissions.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Both India and China will actively explore less
carbon-intensive development strategies, although they
will resist setting targets or timetables for carbon
dioxide emission limits.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A number of major firms operating internationally will
take steps to  reduce greenhouse gas emissions."
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(((Allen Varney remarks:  "That's pretty much it.  I
wonder what difference the CIA's opinion will make. Best
of luck to you, the family, and the Viridian Movement in
the new millennium.")))</P>
