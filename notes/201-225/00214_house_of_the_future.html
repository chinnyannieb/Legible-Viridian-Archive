<P>Attention Conservation Notice: Yet another magazine
appearance, plus other seasonal meanderings and noodlings.</P>

<P>We just put a new web analysis program on the Viridian
home site. Now go click on this, so we can watch the
statistics.

We need better graphic design, too.  Who wants to
volunteer?</P>

  page 43, "The Sensitive House"</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The latest issue of dwell (note lower-case d) magazine
is out.  It's the "2001: Come Home to the Future" issue.
I'm in it, with a strident essay on "the house of the
future."</P>

<P>Unlike most riffs on "houses of the future," this
is not some nostalgic retro flashback about the 20th
century's wacky futuristic notions (Dymaxion House
1929, Pittsburgh House of Glass 1939, Disneyland Monsanto
House 1957, Habitat 67 at Montreal Expo, etc. etc.).
Instead, this is a straight-out <STRONG>brand-new</STRONG> wacky
futuristic notion.  No doubt this essay of mine will
someday seem every bit as corny as those other offerings,
but this is in fact a brief yet determined effort to
describe an entirely  novel kind of future house.  It
centers on environmental sensors and ubiquitous
computation.</P>

<P>If you're the kind of guy or gal who wears brushed-
aluminum glasses in a semi-gentrified urban enclave with
your feet on a secondhand Eames table, then you probably
need  "dwell" on your minimalist coffeetable.  Actually,
it's well worth buying this issue merely for the sake of
the interesting picture of Max Yoshimoto on page 71.  Mr
Yoshimoto, the senior vice president at Lunar Design,
helped create the award-winning blobject Oral-B
toothbrush.  I use his fabulous device every day.  This
thing is the Grand Vizier of toothbrushes.  I have never
known its like.  I'm putting his portrait inside my
medicine cabinet.

<P>"dwell" is also running a bold, refreshing architectural
contest to demolish and rebuild the White House. Some of
our EuroViridian friends might be interested in entering
this "dwell" contest, as, unlike Americans, they may be
able to look at this structure without screaming in
anguish.

<P>And the Viridian Energy Meter soaks up some more free
press from those friendly folks at DESIGNFAX.

<P>DESIGNFAX editrix Kim Chapple
(kchapple@aip.com^^^^^^^^^^^^^^*) further remarks:
"I profiled Pew Center for Global Climate Change in the
same spot. Later this month, I have a meeting in Detroit
with ECOSTAR, a company made up of Ballard Fuel Cell,
Ford, and DaimlerChrysler engineers.  Have a great holiday
season."</P>

<P>Absolutely.</P>
