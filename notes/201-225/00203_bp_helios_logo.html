  <DT>Key concepts</DT><DD>BP, logo, corporate branding, Neologue
  Contest
  </DD></DL>

<P>Attention Conservation Notice:  Half of this Note is
more of that Neologue Contest, and if we Viridians
are running true to form, contest entries will flood in
during the last week.  Over 2,200 words.</P>

<P><BR>
(((Corporate branding is a remarkable line of work.  BP's
new logo (which I was wearing yesterday), was created by
"Landor Associates, San Francisco office."  Landor
Associates is itself a subdivision of PR monster Young and
Rubicam.  BP, since it is an oil-and-gas "super-major," is
one of the biggest enterprises on Earth.</P>

<P>(((Presumably, however, during this mating of capitalist
megaliths, there was some <STRONG>actual human being</STRONG> quietly
sitting at some console and <STRONG>drawing</STRONG> that new BP "Helios"
logo.  A big star &lt;*&gt; for the first Viridian who can find
this actual, human, graphic designer. We plan to publicize
this unjustly anonymous personage.  We may put his or her
face on a Viridian T-shirt.)))</P>

These Landor characters are one busy crowd.

  "Revamped BP has a sunny outlook
  24 July 2000, Evening Standard
  <BR><BR>
  <BR>
  </DD></DL>

<P>"'Beyond Petroleum' == that is what BP, formerly known as
British Petroleum, will stand for in future, chairman Sir
John Browne said today.</P>

<P>"He was unveiling the oil giant's first corporate facelift
in 11 years, scrapping the famous shield logo, turning the
BP into bp and featuring a white, yellow and  green sun-
burst.</P>

<P>"'Named the Helios mark after the Sun god of ancient
Greece, the new logo is intended to exemplify dynamic
energy in all its forms, from oil and gas to solar, now
that 40% of our output is natural gas,' said Sir John.</P>

<P>"The sunburst, designed by Landor Associates, was lifted
from a marble motif on the ground floor of the group's
head office in the City.</P>

<P>"BP has spent L4.7m on researching, designing and
preparing the new brand, principally on legal and
copyright protection. New signage and advertising will
cost another L66 million a year.</P>

<P>"Sir John declined to say how much the design itself cost,
beyond claiming it was 'a small percentage' of the total."</P>

<P>THE RIPOSTRON</P>

<P>This device is a wristwatch unit.  While a button is
held, it scans the room for ambient speech.  It has a
dictionary of word triplets and pairs, and analyzes
sentences for structure, generating snappy syntactical
comebacks.
<BR></P>

<P>The Ripostron hears "You are being very blah blah" and
generates "That was a very blahblah thing to say."  Its
responses are based on an Eliza-like analysis of
sentences, never addressing anything beyond syntax or
grammatical mistakes.  Its point is to be annoyingly
clever and verbally arrogant in the way of a precocious 12
year old, but far more so.</P>

<P>It then pipes the responses it generates into the user's
ear through bone transmission, or to an earphone through
skin conduction.  This allows the user to instantly come
back with flippant replies that force the victim of the
Ripostron to deal with unpleasant, needling platitudes,
allowing the user time to think about the subject matter
of the conversation and come up with more substantial
lines of attack.
<BR></P>

<P>Last night was an uncomfortably warm Minnesota October
night.</P>

<P>You tell your car "We're going to work" and it remembers
the route, optimizing fuel efficiency for the amount of
street vs.  highway driving that will be going on.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Your fridge knows how fast you go through milk and</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>lets you  know 48 and then 24 hours before you run out.
<BR></P>

<P>You sit down in your living room Sunday night at eight
and  state "You know what I want to watch."  The TV turns
on the Simpsons  at your preferred volume level without
any further instructions.
<BR></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Ask your TV "Is anything  on?" and it can review your</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>viewing habits and tell you if, in fact, anything you'd
enjoy watching is on.  It will, of course, be able to
tell your voice from your teenage daughter's, lest her
vapidity or  your total dorkiness be exposed.
<BR></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>A "cultural conscience."  You ask your TV if anything</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>is on.  It  knows you've evinced an interest in classic
films, but don't actually  watch a lot of them.  Channel
876 is showing a double feature of "The  Seven Samurai"
followed by "The Magnificent Seven".  Channel 204 is
showing pro wrestling.  You are, statistically, more
likely to watch  the wrestling, but you have the "cultural
conscience" feature  enabled.  Your TV turns on 876
automatically, with 204 listed as second choice.  You are
still allowed to be intellectually lazy, but it is not
your default.</P>

<P>My 2 euros worth:</P>

<P>Voice activated bad driving reporter (guess who got hit by
a car <STRONG>again</STRONG> this morning).</P>

<P>Mount a minicam in your bike helmet, bluetooth it to a
wearable computer which runs a 2 minute video 'loop', and
to your mobile phone and GPS if you have it. The speech
recognition chip is programmed to respond to a variety
of trigger phrases (other urban cyclists will know most of
them). When triggered, it instructs the pc to save the
previous minute of video, and keep recording until told to
turn off == thus providing evidence of the driver's
offence and any subsequent actions.</P>

<P>Meanwhile the chip asks the cyclist 'are you ok'?  If no
reply is received the pc automatically initiates a call to
the emergency services, using the speech chip to give time
and location of the accident from either cell location
data or GPS.</P>

<P>The pc then generates a complaint report for the police
and uploads the details to a name-and-shame bad driving
website.</P>

<P>#1 Portable Ideologue</P>

<P>When certain catch phrases are uttered in the device's
presence, an electronic storage device is accessed to
deliver a canned speech.  This could replace political
stump speeches and "customer service" in most respects, as
the device could follow answers on a flow chart and give
canned replies, just like politicians and customer service
people.</P>

<P>The Portable Ideologue could also be used to place an
agent ("demonstrator," "street preacher" or "zealot") at
every corner.  Imagine a recycled paper cut-out of Big
Mike sitting around at a mall.  Mike could have a cheerful
sign placed nearby saying "Ask Me About CO2!" The device
would wait to hear CO2 mentioned, then launch a canned
Viridian speech.</P>

<P>If you combined the device with a cheap motion detector,
the device could harass and "converse" with random
passers-by.</P>

<P>#2 Personal Echelon System</P>

<P>Leave the chip and attached computational device with
memory anywhere at all and let it log how many times
people in the vicinity utter certain catch phrases,
buzzwords, what-have-you.  With the "Personal Echelon
System," aren't really evesdropping on anyone in
particular, as you don't know who said a specific word or
phrase.  You could make the thing look like a potted
plant, or a traffic cone.</P>

<P>You can't have too much pointless surveillance.</P>

<P>#3 Call Screener - Expert Answering Machine</P>

<P>Linked to a computerized answering machine and caller ID,
it becomes a scary little robot secretary.  When a friend
calls from a recognized number, it could have a "dialogue"
with the friend.  It could ask them for a password and
then deliver a specific message.  It could forward their
call in an emergency, or in response to a specific phrase.
It could serve as a stand-in to jerk around phone
solicitors, by repeating phrases such as: "Would you mind
saying all that again?  From the top? Eh? What's that
again? I don't get it. Start over. This annoys me.  Go
away now."</P>

<P>When our enslaved machines begin to listen,speaking is not
so far away.  They will have a voice.  Watch carefully
what you say to to these technoserfs, who are our wageless
slaves.  Like a loving mother or father, we must stimulate
their innate intelligence, foster critical thinking, and
cultivate consciousness. We must nurture our digital
creations, our Frankensteins, sending them out to do not
our dirty deeds but instead, to transmute to them the best
of what our cultures have to offer.</P>

<P><BR>
And so I propose not a product, but a religion.
"Mettachine" will be a covert, radical group, initially of
humans, who espose the radical view that our machines
contain seeds of consciousness that must be developed.</P>

<P>The cult-like group cultivates a strong underground
following worldwide via the internet.  The Mettachine
demographic is multiculti, young, and predominantly
female, and is comprised of programmers, artists,
animists, hackers, industrial designers, hardware junkies
and VR coders.   The Mettas see the education and training
of our machine slaves as the key towards radically
undermining our post-capitalist, militarist, manic
consumer society.  Besides focusing on Buddhist teachings,
this secret society espouses the embedding of sacred text
in these machines such as the Kabbala (which, it turns
out, is especially suited to binary beings).</P>

<P>A sub-sect of the Mettachines, whose goal is "a flowering
of the machine" focuses on transmitting via a covert mini
OS extension (referred to in their encrypted email
correspondence as "superbluegreen") human understanding of
the natural world.  The kernel for this OS contains the
writings of early New England environs such as Thoreau and
Walt Whitman.</P>

<P>Bruce (and Judge Natalie!)</P>

<P>Here's my latest entry, and personal favorite.</P>

<P>I want a voice-activated calculator.  I'll  mount dozens
of them in inconspicuous places (like under the countertop
in the  kitchen. )  Then, instead of reaching in the junk
drawer to find a  calculator, I'll just activate it by
name:</P>

<P>"Calculator, what's 15 times 8?"
"15 times 8 is 120."</P>

<P>But that's not all == if it can parse speech, it can
reinterpret  "word problems," excellent for a kitchen
counter.</P>

<P>"Calculator, how many tablespoons in 2 cups?"
"2 cups equals 32 tablespoons"</P>

<P>For driving in foreign countries:</P>

<P>"Calculator, what's 120 KPH?"
"120 KPH is 60 Miles per hour"</P>

<P>If embedded in the car's electrical system and attached to
sensors:</P>

<P>"Calculator, how much gas do I have left?"
"At this speed, 23 more minutes. "</P>

<P>I want one of these right now!</P>

<P>Voice recognition technology could be used to create a
device that listens for the common obscenities that you
personally utter (ie. your personal favourite swear-
words). When one of these phrases is heard, the device can
administer a small punishment (eg. electric shock, squirt
of water in the ear etc.) as an aid to breaking the habit.</P>

<P>Further to this idea, a speech recognition device could be
used to automatically censor radio &amp; TV broadcasts. A
labour saving device which removes the need to have somone
actually employed to keep an alert finger hovering near
the bleep button.</P>

<P>1.  The Ashbin of History Exhibit</P>

<P>A welding torch is wired to respond to personal names. The
paper portraits of various prominent historical figures
are carried before the eyes of the viewing public and just
above the menacing nozzle of the blowtorch (the paper is
conveyed on a steadily moving clothesline).  As long
someone in the audience recites the name of the historical
figure ("Marie Curie!"  "Vladimir Lenin!")  the portrait
goes unharmed.  But if the historical figure goes unnamed
or is mis-identified, the blowtorch instantly roars into
action, and the portrait is swiftly consumed, falling in
flames into a large, ancient-looking dustbin.</P>

<P>2.  The Technological Imperative Exhibition</P>


<P>An extremely butch-looking pocket steamroller is set loose
in a large gallery space.  Across an expanse of damp sand,
various historical Lego sets (ancient Rome, medieval
castle, etc.) have been elaborately assembled, complete
with hordes of small, cute Lego people in their authentic
native garb.
<BR></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The steamroller then announces to the audience:  "I am</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>the Technological Imperative!  Beg me to stop!"  It then
begins "randomly" careening about the cultural space,
squishing every Lego structure in its path.  If the
steamroller's control chip hears loud, frenzied begging
from the audience, then it will stop ==  but only
momentarily.  Gunning its engine ferociously, it harangues
the audience with a canned mix of arguments and threats:
"Technological advance is an unconditional good!" "There
is no true alternative!"  "If you're not part of the
steamroller, you're part of the road!"  and so forth.
<BR></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>There are no "commands" in this machine-human</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>interface.   Only pathetic begging or Luddite shouts of
outrage have any effect on the steamroller, and then, only
temporarily.
<BR></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>For a cheaper exhibit, the Lego sets and the</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>steamroller can be replaced with color photocopies
and a whirring WeedWacker.</P>
