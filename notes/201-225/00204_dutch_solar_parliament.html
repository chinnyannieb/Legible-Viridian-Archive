<P>"Dutch Parliament switching to solar energy</P>

<P>By CRAIG RIMLINGER,  Associated Press Writer</P>

<P>"THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP)  Solar panels are going up
on the roof of the medieval parliament building despite
the rainy Dutch climate, a spokeswoman said Tuesday.</P>

<P>(((They kept taking trains to Berlin and looking wistfully
at that Foster Reichstag.)))</P>

<P>"Parliament spokeswoman Leonne Gartz said that by the
end of the year the solar panels will be mounted on the
tiled roof of the red-brick building, built in stages
between the 13th and 17th centuries. The project will cost
500,000 guilders ($200,000).</P>

<P>(((Luckily, they will be able to amortize that investment
from a financial base starting in the 1200s.)))</P>

<P>"'They should be working in January, maybe earlier,' she
said, adding that the panels will not cloud the beauty of
the structure, which encloses a public courtyard is partly
surrounded by a lily-fringed moat.</P>

<P>(((Hey, that moat is a great algae biomass opportunity!)))</P>

<P>"'The roof is fairly large so if you put (the panels) in
the middle and toward the back, you can't see them from
the street,' said the spokesman, who declined to say how
many would be installed.  (((It's a state secret: they
could tell us, but then they'd have to kill us.)))</P>

<P>"Gartz said the project is part of a 10-year initiative to
convert the entire building to solar energy, even though
the Netherlands gets an average of 131 days of rain per
year and plenty more overcast days.</P>

<P>(((Yeah, and imagine the tidal-power opportunity when
the rising Greenhouse seas come over the dikes.)))</P>

<P>(...)
"Although the announcement came weeks before the
Netherlands hosts a U.N. conference on global climate
change, the spokeswoman said that was nothing more
than 'a funny coincidence.'</P>


<P>"She also denied it had anything to do with a Greenpeace
protest last month, when environmental activists climbed
onto the tower above Prime Minister Wim Kok's office and
laid solar panels on the roof. The tower is connected to
the parliament building."</P>

<P>(((Oh sure.  No possible connections there!  Strangely,
these Dutch Greenpeace guys aren't the only people who go
around surreptitiously attaching solar panels to stuff.
It would appear to be an increasingly popular hobby.
Not that we Viridians condone this semilegal activity,
but hey, gotta start somewhere, even if it's a mere
parliament.)))

<P>Here is a brief description of a communications device
which is badly needed in our society. The brand name of
this modern marvel, from this day henceforth, shall be
DICTOSHIELD.  Its purpose is to provide a privatized
communications system to a group located in a noisy,
chaotic environment.</P>

<P>The DICTOSHIELD will allow specified groups of four to
twenty people to conduct casual conversations while seated
at a noisy restaurant, a baseball game, a jazz festival or
any sound-polluted area.  Working parts of this system
are, simply, earphones, a receiver/transmitter, and a tiny
wraparound microphone for each group member == plus a chip
that can recognize and will transmit only the voices of
people in the private network.</P>

<P>Is there really a need for such a contrivance?  The answer
is a resounding YES!  Consider, for example, that vast
army of well-heeled senior citizens who refuse to enter
certain restaurants because they are 'too noisy'.  Many of
these people are hard of hearing, and find that their
favorite pastimes: telling jokes, giving updates on their
physical conditions, spouting political theories, or just
plain pontificating, get very little play when they are
surrounded by 'noise pollution'. They want to hear and be
heard by family and friends, while enjoying a fine meal.
This problem is especially acute when groups of eight,
ten, twelve, or more gather at one table.  Most members in
these larger groups feel completely isolated.  Thoughtful
and enterprising restaurant owners, as an added service,
might make this equipment available to 'sound-sensitive'
patrons.</P>

<P>This should be a no-brainer for entrepreneurs who can
assemble, package, advertise and distribute these sets to
electronic hardware outlets.  And remember folks, when you
finally get your very own DICTOSHIELD, you heard about it
first at Viridian Neologue.</P>

<P>Voice sensor judges audience reaction to
television/radio/web sites.  Measures all sorts of human
vocalizations: laughter during sitcoms (as opposed to
snorts of disgust, or dead silence), crying/sniffling
during particularly moving TV dramas, singing along to
radio programs, murmurs of comprehension/agreement while
reading/watching news, etc.</P>


<P>Also of use for politicians during political
commercials/debates == get instant feedback on a
politician's level of acceptance/approval by measuring the
vocal outbursts that accompany a statement. (I was
screaming at my television set during the Presidential
debates... perhaps my vocalizations could now a better
purpose then annoying my roomate.)

<P>Voice recognition:</P>


<P>While shaving/showering/washing dishes.  "Hotter."
"Colder."  "Less flow."  "Off."  "On."</P>


<P>Sound recognition:</P>


<P>Recognizes the sound of a razor blade being drawn against
the skin, or teeth brushing, or dishes being rattled in
the dishwasher.  The chip knows that those sounds indicate
the water is not being actively used at that particular
<U>moment, and slows or stops the water flow accordingly.</U><BR></P>

<P>I perceive that my previous contest-entry wasn't entirely
relevant to a <STRONG>conceptual art</STRONG> contest.  It didn't SAY
anything.  Try this:</P>

<P>The Last Machine</P>

<P>This is a mobile extrusion machine.  It lives in
some large source of sand, preferably in an area well
above sea level. The moon would work well.  The machine
has a powerplant of some kind, long lasting, and it
doesn't matter if it's dirty.</P>

<DL>
  <DT>What it does is simple</DT><DD>It scans the airwaves for human
  speech, of any language.  When it no longer hears any, it
  sits and listens for a while longer, just to make sure.
  </DD></DL>

<P>Then, it begins making grave markers, out of sand and some
sort of locally available binder,  and placing them in
neat rows. When it's made six billion, it stops.</P>

<P>Yet another Neologue entry:</P>

<P>A microphone that filters out "um's" and "uh's."  In
rehearsal, it  could give a mild electrical shock to the
speaker to train him or her  to avoid awkward pause-
fillers, but in actual use, it would simply  reduce volume
on programmed keywords.  As long as I'm dreaming about
it, why not make it fill the gap in by stretching out the
most  recent words.  It could record ten seconds at a time
and smooth out  all the pauses and gaps to make the final
product much more  listenable.</P>

  <DT>Neologue Entry</DT><DD>Voice-controlled message display for rear
  window  of car
  </DD></DL>

<P>The Back Talk is a voice-controlled LED "zipper board"
that attaches to the inside of your car's rear window with
suction cups.</P>

<P>The character-display elements are jointed, so that the
whole unit can flex slightly; this allows the board to
conform to the curve of the window. The individual LEDs
are sunk in deep sockets, so that only the driver directly
behind can see the display; socketing also makes the
message more visible during daylight.</P>

<P>The Back Talk doesn't actually translate speech to text;
the voice recognition unit triggers the display of a
preset message. The driver would shout the desired
message, which would play for a half-minute of so, or
until the driver shouted "CLEAR!"</P>

<P>The unit can be "trained" and new messages added via a
cable connection to a standard PC/Mac USB port. Included
messages would be bland and cheery, like "THANKS FOR
LETTING ME IN" and "BABY ON BOARD" and "PLEASE DON'T
TAILGATE." Of course, users can enter any message they
want.</P>

<P>A really sophisticated version of this would paint
messages on a specially treated rear window using a laser,
but an LED panel is a good place to start.</P>

<P>Very simple.</P>

<P>A little module that can be attached to anything,
anywhere. Preferably hidden, and often moved.</P>

<P>When it hears the phrase "God," "Oh God," or "Oh my God,"
a scintillating contralto woman's voice, surrounded by
multi-dimensional synth sounds, says, "Yes?"</P>

<P>#1 THE GOD COMPLEX</P>

<P>A woman sits in a darkened room. White noise plays in the
background, not a breath of air disturbs the stillness.
Nothing can be heard but her voice,  speaking commands to
the room. The room remains quiet and unresponsive. Then
she utters the key phrase:</P>

<P>"Let there be light!"</P>

<P>All at once a soft glow illuminates the room from huge LCD
screens panelling each wall, and the ceiling. The commands
continue. "Let the light be separated from the darkness",
"Let there be trees and grass, and all manner of  growing
things". Images appear on the walls representing the
results of her  instructions - plants and animals and
insects and stars. Her virtual world  comes to life.</P>

<P>But something is wrong. She has spoken into existence
green plants, but waits too long before requiring insects.
Many of the plants, deprived of any means of pollination,
start to die out. She corrects her mistake.  The insects
multiply over the face of the earth, with no animals to
eat them and keep them in check. "More plants!" she cries.
"Herbivores!" "Carnivores!" A million lions rampage down
from the mountains, destroying all the goats in their
path.</P>

<P>All around her is a riot of life and colour, constantly
dying and coming to  life. But without her constant
involvement, equilibrium is soon destroyed as one group
prospers over another == to its short-lived triumph.
Eventually, in desperation she calls out "Let there be:
mankind!"</P>

<P>A small tribe appears, settles itself next to a forest,
and begins to farm. The woman watches expectantly. It
seems, at first, as though all is well....</P>

<P>This installation acts as an object lesson in the delicate
balance of nature, and the inherent difficulties involved
in playing God.</P>

<P>#2 THE TRICKLE-DOWN EFFECT</P>

<P>The Trickle-Down effect is an installation consisting of a
huge transparent pyramid of separate levels, half-filled
with water. Moisture-sensitive dyes and lights are
embedded in each level of the pyramid, so that when they
are filled with water they are sparkling and full
of life.  When dry they are dull and empty.</P>

<P>At the bottom of the pyramid, pumps move water into the
top levels. As the water reaches the top, it begins to
"trickle-down" through thousands of tiny holes.</P>


<P>But, although the water is indeed trickling down, the
process is so slow that, left to itself, the top levels of
the pyramid will always be brimming with water, while the
bottom levels will always be bone dry.</P>

<P>The pumps are voice-sensitive. At the repetition of chosen
economic mantras, the pumps can be made to slow down.
Whispers of "greed is good" and "a rising tide lifts all
boats" causes them to falter. But the effect is limited to
the pump nearest the speaker. A raised voice does not
help; the pumps do not like to be shouted at. Above a
certain volume the pumps fail to respond at all</P>

<P>The best effects are achieved by concerted action. Verbal
variations can slow down the pumps and open the apertures.
A dozen people murmuring "Green is Good" can cause the
water to flow freely.</P>

<P>The Trickle-Down Effect is seen in its most fertile and
beautiful aspect, with water flowing down continually
through every level, when surrounded by a crowd gently
whispering "A rising tide is very bad news in the
Netherlands."</P>

<P>#3 THE ORATOR</P>

<P>The Orator is a device designed for those with normal
mental grasp of the English language, but physicval
difficulty in making themselves understood.  This could be
due to conditions such as deafness or cerebral palsy, or
simply a very thick accent. The chip is trained to
recognise the sound of one particular user's pronunciation
of a variety of phonemes.  It then repeats them in a
clearer, easy to understand voice.</P>

<P>The Orator thus acts as a transparent interface between
the user and the outside world. For a deaf user, the
Orator  is equipped with a small screen on which it will
write out the words as it hears them.</P>

<div align="center"><P>O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O<br>
I MAY NOT KNOW ART,<br>
BUT I KNOW WHAT I HEAR<br>
O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O</P></div>
