<P>Attention Conservation Notice:  Blackouts get much,
much more press attention if you are Californian.</P>

<P>"SERBIA FACES ENERGY CRUNCH. Serbia is now undergoing one
of the worst energy crises in its history. The reasons for
the power crisis are multiple, and they are natural as
well as man-made.</P>

<P>"Serbia has experienced insufficient rainfall for the
past nine months, which has lowered water levels on the
Danube, Drina, and Sava rivers. Low water levels not only
hamper hydropower output, but also affect production at
thermal electric plants, where water is needed for cooling
systems.  (((Weird weather patterns screw up hydro-power,
but that's just part of it.  Droughts also screw up water-
cooling systems for fossil-fuel plants and even nuclear
plants.)))</P>

<P>"For more than 10 years before, Serbia undertook only
minimal investment in energy infrastructure. It also
provided cheap, subsidized electric power to its citizens,
which hardly encouraged them to cut back consumption.
Seventy-eight days of NATO air strikes that targeted
Serbia's energy grid also took their toll in 1999.
(((It's that long rain of smart-bombs that makes Serbia
unique.)))</P>

<P>"Serbia now has to contend as well with Russia's
displeasure over its unpaid energy bills.  (((You've got
to really stretch it to get an "unpaid bill" with Russia;
Russian banks are so crooked that most the the time, the
Russians can't even tell.))) In addition, the new leaders
have recently ended Milosevic's practice of illicitly
tapping into the electric power supplies of neighboring
countries by abusing the regional electricity grid.
(((Now that's utility reform.)))</P>

<P>"All this has produced one of the worst energy crises in
the republic's history, and the public is very angry. On
27 December, crowds blocked streets and tram lines in
Belgrade to protest the random six-to-10-hour blackouts
the authorities have instituted. The next day, two
electricity-generating units at a key power plant remained
off-line for repairs, causing further blackouts and large
traffic jams in Belgrade when traffic lights failed.</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>"Some Serbs have resorted to the anti-Milosevic protest<BR>
tactic of 1997==banging pots and pans. Serbia's Interior<BR>
Minister Bozo Prelevic has appealed to them to hold their<BR>
protests in places, where as he put it, 'the dignity and<BR>
human rights of other people would not be endangered.'<BR>
<BR>
"Serbia's Minister of Mining and Energy Srboljub Antic<BR>
says the list of priority facilities==including hospitals,<BR>
waterworks, heating plants, and food processing plants==<BR>
qualifying for a steady supply of electricity will now be<BR>
further limited. But he notes the blackouts will be spread<BR>
out evenly."<BR></P>
