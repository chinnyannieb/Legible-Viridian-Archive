<P>"The lights stayed on in 2000, but just barely.</P>

<P>"This was the year Californians stopped taking energy for
granted. The state's failed attempt to deregulate the
electricity market resulted in a surge in wholesale power
prices, a tripling of some consumers' bills and financial
devastation for the two biggest utilities.</P>

<P>"But until the supply of electricity can meet the state's
rapidly growing demand == something that will not happen
for years == it seems clear that California's energy
crisis will get worse before it gets better. (((He said
"years," folks.  Wow.)))</P>

<P>"'Every possible thing that could go wrong has happened,'
said Michael Worms,  an energy-industry analyst with
Gerard Klauer Mattison in New York. 'It's actually pretty
amazing.'  (((It's definitely amazing, but energy problems
can get a  lot worse than this.  If this systemic  failure
happened in a state without a Mediterranean  climate, the
people would die in droves.)))</P>

<P>(...)</P>

<P>"'This is the ghost of summers future,' Michael Shames,
executive director of the Utility Consumers' Action
Network, predicted at the time.</P>

<P>(((Great soundbite, Michael!    This aptly-named Shames
guy has got a nice California Crisis website. Kind of a
nice, crunchy, homemade ripped-off consumer design look-
and-feel there.)))
Link: <A HREF="http://www.ucan.org">http://www.ucan.org</A></P>

<P>(((On his unfortunately garish website, Michael Shames
also offers a fabulously boring 20-page document that
explains in  painful detail why California ran out of
energy, and why it can't get any merely by being
politically correct.  Here it is:)))</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.ucan.org/law_policy/energydocs/Whathappened.htm">http://www.ucan.org/law_policy/energydocs/Whathappened.htm</A></P>

<P>(((I'll summarize this document later. In the meantime,
it's back to feeling California's pain via the SF
Chronicle and reporter David Lazarus.)))</P>

<P><BR>
"At this point, California's energy crisis split into two
separate but related issues.</P>

<P>"On the one hand, chronic power shortages threatened to
derail the state's red-hot economic expansion.   (((Net
infrastructure goes broke.)))</P>

<P>"On the other, the leading utilities were warning of
possible bankruptcy if they were left holding the bag for
billions in extra expenses.   (((Power infrastructure goes
broke.)))</P>

<P>(((This crisis should not be split into two issues.  The
21st century century solution is network convergence.  The
digital nets should eat the voltage  nets and make them
much less filthy and clumsy.  Not much  sign of this
lovely result so far, though.  California's hackers think
their voltage  comes from Oz.  Too bad it comes from
Texas.)))</P>

<P>"Wall Street, meanwhile, started taking notice.  (((Uh-
oh.)))</P>

<P>"'No one wants to hold stock in a company that is
subsidizing its customers,' said Paul Patterson, an
analyst at Credit Suisse First Boston in New York. 'If
PG&amp;E has to swallow this loss, investors will run in
droves.'</P>

<P>(((So on the money front, it's Wall Street financiers
versus NIMBY-obsessed California consumers.   These two
power-groups can't get at each other  directly; they'll
have to fight by proxy, ripping the  public services to
shreds.)))</P>

<P>"PG&amp;E placed its power-related debt at almost $5 billion
and said it was losing an additional $1 million an hour.
(((An impressive burn-rate even in California.)))</P>

<P>"'The credit situation is getting much tighter,' said
PG&amp;E's Pruett. 'There will come a time when we won't be
able to buy power for people. This is going to happen more
sooner than later.' (...)</P>

<P>"They have chosen to ensure unconscionable profits for the
pirate generators and power brokers who are gouging
California consumers and businesses,' the governor said.
(((That would be California Governor Gray Davis, coining
the exotic 21st century term "pirate generators."  How
slashdot of him.   And where's that money  going?  If it
goes anywhere besides a pile of deficits, it'll go to the
people who  sold fossil fuel to California.)))</P>

<P>"In fact, industry insiders estimated that Californians
had paid about $10 billion in extra electricity charges
since prices spiked in the summer. (((Ten billion is big
money, but there's much bigger money in the debts the
Californians <STRONG>haven't</STRONG> paid.  Instead, they've stuck the
utilities with the tab.)))</P>

<P>"'This is one of the highest transfers of wealth from
people in this state to those outside the state in
history,' said Mindy Spatt, a spokeswoman for The Utility
Reform Network in San Francisco."</P>

<P>(((Some people coin great soundbites. Some people ==
dirty, smog-covered Southerners, mostly == produce and
ship energy.  They have the  Golden State over a barrel,
OPEC-style.  California's  beggars can't be choosers, but
that doesn't mean they have  to be polite about it.)))</P>

<P>"The Confederate Cartel's war against California</P>

<P>"The current war over electricity is a war over the future
of California.</P>

<P>By Daniel M. Berman</P>

<P>"The Confederate Cartel of Southern, Enron, and Reliant is
holding California for ransom and looting it dry.
(((Southern, Enron, and Reliant sell natural gas.
Californians have no other suppliers.)))   There's no
doubt Pacific Gas and Electric will try again to push
through a huge percentage rate increase(...).  And the
bounty will go to holding companies in Texas and the
Carolinas, giving them more cash to buy out PG&amp;E Corp. and
Edison International.  (((Buying California with the cash
from its own gullibility!  New Rules for the New
Economy.)))</P>

<P>"Attorney Jason Zeller, testifying for the normally mild-
mannered Office of Ratepayer Advocates, told the
commission on December 29 that 'this enormous transfer of
wealth ...[is] ... the kind of thing that nations have
gone to war over.'  (((Good luck going to war with no
energy, fella.  Empty fuel tanks, busted supply lines....
the kind of crimp in one's style that defeated Erwin
Rommel.)))</P>

<P>"Is the threat of a Confederate takeover of our energy
future for real? Look what has happened to California's
biggest bank and biggest telephone company in the past
five years: the Bank of America is now owned by a bank
holding company based in North Carolina, and PacBell is
now owned by SBC Communications, Inc. out of Dallas. High
electric rates will also drive business out of California
to the benefit of Texas and the Southeast, the bedrock of
Republican support. (...)  Will President George W. Bush,
who believes 'the free market' will solve our electricity
problems, oppose further takeovers by hostile interests?"
(((These must be rhetorical questions. Oh yes, the Texan
Peril is at hand == and they've <STRONG>got the White House.</STRONG>
Time for a serious policy re-think. The Confederates don't
lack customers, so as far as Californians are concerned,
it's pay up or sit in the dark.  Is it too late to
surrender and beg abjectly for mercy?)))</P>

<P>(((Okay, so much for the extortionate profits in fossil
fuel.  Where's the <STRONG>political</STRONG> money going?)))</P>

<P>"Electricity Deregulation</P>

<P>"WHAT'S THE ISSUE?</P>

<P>"The U.S. electric industry is undergoing a sea change in
the way it delivers electricity to millions of households
and businesses nationwide. The $220 billion industry,
which has been called the last great government-sanctioned
monopoly, is slowly but surely being deregulated and
opened to competition, giving consumers the power to
choose their electricity provider in much the same way
they choose telephone carriers. (...)</P>

<P>"THE MONEY</P>

<P>"As talk of national electricity deregulation intensified
in the 1990s, electric utilities == not surprisingly ==
increased their political contributions to candidates and
parties. In 1992, utilities contributed a total of $5.4
million in individual, PAC, and soft money contributions.
That figure nearly doubled to $9.5 million in 1996. That
figure could double again when the final statistics for
the 2000 election cycle are known.</P>

<P>"The strongest area of growth in political giving from
electric utilities has been in the form of soft money. In
1992, utilities contributed just $556,000 in unlimited,
unregulated soft money to the Democratic and Republican
parties. By 1996, soft money contributions increased by
more than six times to $3.6 million. The industry's soft
money contributions more than doubled in the 2000 election
cycle to approximately $8 million.  (((That's still
peanuts when you're losing a million dollars an hour.  The
utilities have been harpooned and they are bleeding soft
money.  Political fundraisers are standing around with
buckets.  You think they're going to patch up that $220
billion whale any time soon?)))</P>

<P>"It seems that every major group within the electric
industry is pouring money into political activities. In
fact, there's so much money being thrown around that some
observers say Congress has little incentive to resolve the
matter quickly.  (((A very Russian situation here ==
crooked  pirates feasting indefinitely on the bleeding
remnants of  the state-supported economic sectors.)))
Lobbyists, too,  are reaping the benefits of the issue.
One lobbyist even  called it the 'two-Lexus bill,' reports
CQ Weekly.  (((A Lexus goes pretty cheap these days, what
with that dotcom crash in California.)))</P>

<P>"The undisputed lobbying leader in this issue is the
Edison Electric Institute, which has spent tens of
millions of dollars lobbying Congress on behalf of large
investor-owned electric companies. (((Edison Electric
Institute are merely the biggest among a vast swarm, but
just so you'd know.))) (...)</P>

<P>"And then there are the advertisers. As any Congressional
staffer or lobbyist knows, publications aimed at Congress
have been filled with ads from companies and groups
staking out positions on the debate over electricity
deregulation. These groups include Americans for
Affordable Electricity, a coalition of large-scale
business consumers of electricity; Citizens for State
Power, a conservative coalition backed by investor-owned
electric utilities; and the Electric Utility Shareholders&sup1;
Alliance, a coalition of cooperatives, investor-owned
utilities and labor interests.   (((Plus a swarm of
Greenhouse denial freaks such as Greening Earth Society
and Global Climate Coalition.  It's not surprising to
peel up the lid and find a bunch of Viridian class-enemies
hard at work here.)))</P>

<P>(((Money talks, soundbites walk.  So here's the executive</P>

<P>summary: Silicon Valley down,  natural gas marketing<BR>
companies up, up, up. Al Gore Info Superhighway,<BR>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<P>Thing.  Sue your heads off in the dark, Californians. If
there's any business entity politically  covered in an
Administration run by two Texan oil men,  it's Texan
energy companies like Reliant and Enron.)))</P>

<P>(((So now you know where the money went.  For extra
credit, here's a long, rather technical explanation of
where the voltage went.  I'm saving all this for last,
because these stark facts of life are so boring that even
the California Legislature couldn't handle them. If
California's power  elite had been adding up the watts,
they would have known they were coming up a cropper; but
since they  didn't bother to do that, they'll have to
fingerpoint, instead.</P>

<P>(((This California energy crisis has market manipulation
involved.  Of course it does. There are no free markets in
fossil fuels: OPEC is a cartel.  Calories aren't bits.
People <STRONG>die</STRONG> to get fossil fuel; it is the biggest,
toughest, bloodiest business in the world.</P>

<P>(((But that's not the whole problem.  If politics could
trump engineering, then an interstate legal war on
"Confederates" would turn California's voltage back on.
It won't, because it can't.  Justice comes with a
blindfold and a balance, not a generator.)))</P>

<P>"WHAT HAS CAUSED CALIFORNIA'S ENERGY CRISIS
<BR></P>

<P>"(...) It is fair to say that Murphy's Law has
controlled almost every aspect of electric services ==
from generation to delivery, anything that could have gone
wrong HAS gone wrong.(...)  The energy crisis will
disrupt the lives and economic well-being of Californians
for at least the next four years.</P>

<P>    "We Allowed Ourselves to Run Out of Electric
Generation Capacity. California failed to build renewables
and cogeneration (...) while relying on out-of-state power
that turned up missing this summer.
<BR></P>

<P>"We Allowed The Natural Gas Market to be Cornered. Lax
federal and state regulation led to market manipulation by
the natural gas pipelines and the energy marketers who
control pipeline capacity.
<BR></P>

<P>"We Overlooked the Interaction of Natural Gas &amp;
Electric Markets. Regulators failed to recognize the
interaction between the natural gas and the electric
generation markets. When one is out of balance, the
other market breaks down as well.
<BR></P>

<P>"We Tolerated Lazy Regulation.  The movement to
deregulation served as a convenient excuse to reduce
regulatory oversight and authority, to the detriment of
the competitive energy markets that were supposed to have
been formed.</P>

<P>"How We Ran Out of Electric Generating Capacity</P>

<P>"In 1996, when the state Legislature passed the electric
restructuring law (AB1890), the legislators were told
that California had plenty of power in the near term, but
that new power would need to be built.  The theory, at
that time, was that the private market would see the need
for new power plants and would be able to deploy these new
plants cheaper and faster than under regulation.</P>

<P>"In 1995, the California Energy Commission issued its
Electricity Report 94.  It forecast that California had
plenty of power through 2001.  It predicted reserve
margins in 2001 in the range of 21-23% for PG&amp;E and
Edison, when only 16% was needed == in other words, power
surpluses of about 2000 MW between the two companies.</P>

<P>"However, that rosy assessment relied on a number of
resources that, when push came to shove, were not there:</P>

<P>"Nine hundred megawatts of renewable and cogeneration
capacity (684 MW Edison, 246 MW PG&amp;E) to be acquired (...)
were never purchased.(...)  The utilities, particularly
Edison, got FERC  (((FERC are the feds))) to kill the
auction as discriminatory against other power generators.
We ended up spending $90 million of ratepayer money (...)
to bail out the utilities for killing these contracts and
didn't get a single kilowatt-hour.  (((California's
utilities didn't want to build expensive, complicated
green stuff, so they sidestepped the work.  That capacity
would be mighty handy right now.  And mighty
profitable.)))</P>

<P>"Nearly 2300 MW of uncontracted 'spot' capacity (1700 MW
for PG&amp;E and 588 MW for Edison) from Northwest and
Southwest sources who have proven that (1) when push comes
to shove, they have very little energy to sell and (2)
were demanding cash on the barrelhead to sell what little
they had (...).  ((((1) The kindness of strangers.  (2)
Fossil fuel price spikes are for everybody.  When there's
an OPEC line around the block, nobody's your pal.)))</P>

<P>"Over 2000 MW of DSM that the utilities had no intention
of ever acquiring.  PG&amp;E and Edison were projected to be
acquiring 100-150 MW per year each, at the same time as
they were cutting their budgets in response to
performance-based ratemaking incentives and acquiring only
40-70 MW per year each. (...)  (((Don't pretend you'll
build 150 megawatts, and then build just 40 because that
looks a whole lot better on this quarter's report.)))</P>

<P>"One hundred megawatts of non-existent line loss savings
from interruptibles, because the CEC forgot that most of
them were at transmission voltage, not secondary
distribution.  (((Don't blow stuff off through sheer
technical ignorance, either!)))</P>

<P>"Add up all of these overestimates and the 2000 MW surplus
becomes a 2000 MW deficit, with reserve margins in the 8-
10% range. (...)   These actions set the stage for the
artificial shortage of generation that has hit the western
United States in 2000."</P>

<P>(((That long, eye-glazing recitation doesn't even count
the stark effects of  California's suddenly booming demand
for energy, due to Greenhouse heatwaves and, well, the
Digital Gold Rush. "Gold Rushes Finish Ugly," as they say;
and lo and behold, the Golden State of California is four
thousand megawatts and forty billion dollars short.
Californians have two basic choices here: whine all the
way down, or invent their way out of it. Every crisis is
an opportunity, are we right?  Is this a new economy == or
was it a mere "New Economy?"  Good luck, California!
We'll be watching!)))</P>
