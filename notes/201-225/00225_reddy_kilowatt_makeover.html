<p> </p>
<P>(((Electrical utilities are old.  Even their mascots are
well past retirement age.  That fabulous icon of electric
utility service, "Reddy Kilowatt," was designed way
back in 1925,  by an  Alabama industry booster and
electro-promotional  specialist, Ashton B. Collins.</P>

<P>(((The electro-humanoid Reddy has received a number of
graphic rethinks over the decades.  Ashton's original
primitive Reddy was a very peculiar, multi-armed Shiva
creature.)))</P>

<DL>
  <DT>Link</DT><DD>Reddy's dad and a Viridian spiritual ancestor,
  Ashton B. Collins, Sr.
  <A HREF="http://www.elmararuba.com/bdReddyKilowatt.html">http://www.elmararuba.com/bdReddyKilowatt.html</A>
  </DD><DT>Link</DT><DD>Reddy used to be quite the electro-babe electro-
  magnet.

  </DD><DT>Link</DT><DD>Reddy's so old-fashioned that he still promotes
  smoking. The poor guy is totally smokestack-dependent!
  <A HREF="http://www.zippo.myweb.nl/READY.HTM">http://www.zippo.myweb.nl/READY.HTM</A>
  </DD><DT>Link</DT><DD>Reddy has some downmarket veteran pals, too:
  the eerie "Danny Thunderbolt" and the rural hick "Willie
  Wirehand."  Danny and Willie still show up at cattle-
  calls, but they can't buy themselves an honest gig on a TV
  commercial.

  </DD></DL>

<P>(((Reddy also had a prolonged and scandalous dalliance
with nuclear power, back in its glamor days.  More
recently, Reddy was purchased by the  Northern States
Power Co., and provided with an upstart nephew, "Reddy
Flame," who shills for the natural gas industry.</P>

<P>(((With his energy-hog lightbulb nose and his original,
short-prone earplugs,  Reddy has been quite the global
icon.  He's been used by hundreds of utilities worldwide.
He was "Don Kilovatio" in Spain, "Zet Kilowatt" in Brazil,
and "Le Bon Genie de L'Electricite" in Belgium.  In Cuba,
Fidel Castro had Reddy liquidated as a class enemy.</P>

<P>(((Today, Reddy is incinerating the planet Earth.  If</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>Reddy doesn't go green, we're going to fry.  This bleak<BR>
situation demands a brand-new Reddy == in fact, two new<BR>
Reddies.<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<P>(((The first is Reddy as Reddy really exists in today's
utility environment.  "Servant of mankind," my eye!  The
guy is  flatulent with overpriced gas!  He's dissolute!
Rusty! Careless! On the take!  An environmental war
criminal bloated with windfall profits, a sucker for every
political fundraiser in DC or the state capitals!  Reddy,
for shame!</P>

<P>(((The second Reddy is a total Viridian Reddy rethink:
<STRONG>Greeny Megawatt!</STRONG>  With-it!  Sexy!  Consumer-friendly!
Ultra-designed!  Renewable and pro-survival!</P>

<P>(((Yes, I know that the immediate urge of our many</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>contestants will be to do that leprous, Adbusters version<BR>
of Reddy.  Because Reddy <STRONG>deserves it</STRONG> ==  chainsmoking<BR>
his big-coal cigars, prone to alcoholic Stage Three<BR>
blackouts, grossly obese and laid up in the OPEC drunk-<BR>
tank!  But folks == that version is the <STRONG>easy</STRONG> one.<BR>
That pitch is not going to get us off the hook.<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<P>(((Give some mature thought to our serious need for a
consumer-friendly Greeny Megawatt. Utility networks are
not going away.  They are far less likely to disappear
than Florida, Bangladesh, Holland and the polar ice caps.
Today, we face the same promotional need that the immortal
Ashton Collins rose to meet in 1925.  We  need an
imaginative, attractive, humanizing icon for a
sophisticated 21st century cybergreen cyberutility.</P>

<P>(((Mind you, we Viridians do not plan to infringe on the
exclusive merchandising rights to Reddy Kilowatt,
possessed by Northern States Power. Reddy is almost as old
as Mickey Mouse and therefore, just like Mickey Mouse,
Reddy probably belongs by right in the public domain, but,
well, tell it to Disney lobbyists.  Our Viridian Makeover</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>of Reddy Kilowatt is <STRONG>a legally protected parody,</STRONG> all<BR>
right?  It's <STRONG>funny,</STRONG>  it's an act of <STRONG>satirical humor.</STRONG><BR>
We promise that we won't do Reddy  any harm  ==<BR>
at least, no more than Northern Power did  when they<BR>
removed his classic insulating rubber booties<BR>
and gave him, ugh, velcro joggers.<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<P>(((So: redesign Reddy Kilowatt, and place this image on a
webpage where the rest of us can see it.  Send me the
address and I will post it to the Viridian List.   The
winning design will be the one which creates the most</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>severe cognitive dissonance when it comes to traditional<BR>
utilities == the fresh and innovative Reddy design that<BR>
makes a  naive passerby stop dead and say, "Whoa! Check<BR>
that  electro-dude out!  Electricity is an entirely<BR>
different world now!"<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<P>(((The winner of the Reddy Kilowatt Makeover Contest
receives a coveted and attractive "REDDY KILOWATT Bobble
Head Statuette!"  A proven treat!  Yes, we have one of
these bobbling Reddys here at the Viridian Vatican, where
Reddy has provoked much admiring comment, especially last
Christmas when we had him riding a windmill bareback.)))
