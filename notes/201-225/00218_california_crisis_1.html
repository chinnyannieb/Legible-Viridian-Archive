<P>Attention Conservation Notice:  Pitiless analysis of the
Golden State's pathetic energy debacle.  Should cause no
end of chuckling schadenfreude among dirigiste
EuroViridians.  Part One of Three.</P>

<P>New to Viridian List?  Get up to speed with our ongoing
obsessions on our lovely, text-crammed website!

<hr>

<P>(((As readers from the previous century know, it hasn't
escaped Viridian notice that California is having an
energy crisis.  The situation is chronic.  It has finally
becoming intense and dramatic as bills come due and
California utilities face bankruptcy.  This pits
California consumers against Wall Street financiers.
Since they can't get directly to  grips with one another
(in fact, they're often the very same people), a merry
search is on for scapegoats.  Losing lots of money always
wakes people up. We're looking at something in the
neighborhood of forty billion dollars gone.</P>

<P>(((This situation is an ugly, multifaceted mess.  It's
amazing that such a debacle should strike a locale which
prides itself on being technically aware.  Unfortunately
"technology" is best-defined as "stuff invented recently."
So even though there's nothing more profoundly
"technological" than a vast, hugely expensive, coal-
gobbling, sky-wrecking energy network, it's been allowed
to slip into fetid neglect and denial.</P>

<P>(((What we Viridians would like to find now is a  one
stop, web-based California Crisis Watch.  We need a clean,
well-designed place where we can pull up a Leap Chair,
munch our popcorn, and watch the state's physical,
electrical, digital, legal, financial, and political
infrastructure brown-out from the comfort of our own homes
and offices.  It's too much to ask that we Viridians
should supply this ourselves, since we are way too
detached, cerebral, theory-centric, global and
multinationalist and, uhh, lazy.  Besides, why should we
Viridians  figure out what's going on when California's
entire political and industrial establishment is
blinkered, losing their heads, and loudly blaming it on
anybody but themselves?</P>

<P>(((Somewhere on the web there must be a well-informed
hobbyist pundit with a sardonic taste for whimsy who is
keeping track of all this.  We'll give a lovely Viridian
star &lt;*&gt; to the person who can find us the most
entertaining spot on the web in which to follow the
California debacle.</P>

<P>(((In the meantime, let's compile a few cogent quotes from
various sources that illustrate the extent and nature of
the trouble.  First off the bat: the link between
blackouts and weather violence.)))</P>

<DL>
  <DT>Source</DT><DD>David Lazarus, San Francisco Chronicle
  January 11, 2001
  </DD></DL>

<P>"The California Independent System Operator has downgraded
Thursday's Stage Three power emergency to a Stage Two
emergency, ending the threat of rolling blackouts across
the Bay Area. (...)  (((They escaped another blackout
bullet == for now.  But winter is supposed to be the easy
season for California utilities.)))</P>

<P>"Earlier Thursday, an underground explosion triggered a
power outage that is affecting traffic signals and about
4,000 customers in northern San Francisco. (...) Motorists
are reminded to treat broken signals as a four-way stop
sign."  (((Californians need a lot of reminders about
everyday Third World conditions. Maybe a nice paper
manual, in big print, for candle-light.)))</P>

<P>"Cal ISO issued a warning today that rolling power
blackouts could affect the entire state until 8 p.m."</P>

<DL>
  <DT>Link</DT><DD>Current system conditions at the California ISO.
  This website shows California's power hunger in real-time.
  Note the direct relevance of weather conditions.
  <A HREF="http://www.caiso.com/SystemStatus.html">http://www.caiso.com/SystemStatus.html</A>
  </DD></DL>

<P>"Kellan Fluckiger, the ISO's chief operating officer, said
blackouts this evening could affect as many as 2 million
homes.</P>

<P>"'We are working with neighboring states to access all
possible megawatts,' he said. 'We're asking for all the
megawatts we can get.'   (((Nice slogan, Kellan.  Maybe
you should print T-shirts.)))</P>

<P>"Fluckiger blamed today's shortage on mechanical
difficulties at a number of plants, as well as on
bottlenecks in transmission lines."  (((These are
<STRONG>infrastructure</STRONG> problems.  They have nothing to do with
the political problems of deregulation, or the economic
problems of price spikes in natural gas.   Californian
power demand has outgrown California's physical network.
And the real devil here is climate disruption.  Nobody
built that network to operate under well-nigh constant
storms and heat spikes.)))</P>

<P>"He also said high seas affected intake of cooling water
at some coastal plants, including PG&amp;E's Diablo Canyon
nuclear power station. Kelp and debris became entangled in
valves, causing generators to be turned off."  (((A
remarkable weather-related nuclear-power dysfunction
here.)))</P>

<P>"If rolling blackouts are called for, PG&amp;E has divided its
4.5 million customers into blocks; each block would be
darkened for about an hour at a time. "  (((It should
prove interesting to live in  blackout checkerboards like
that.  What might life be like if that went on for
months?)))</P>

  <DT>Source</DT><DD>Don Thompson, Associated Press
  Thursday, January 11, 2001
  </DD></DL>

<P>"(01-11) 12:54 PST SACRAMENTO (AP) == California faced the
threat of rolling blackouts Thursday as a storm and
maintenance needs hampered key power plants, cutting
generation one-third in the already energy-strapped state.
(((More storms, more maintenance.)))</P>

<P>"California's power production fell more than 15,000
megawatts == or one-third of the state's generating
capacity == in part due to a storm carrying high winds and
heavy rain, Dorinson said. One megawatt is enough to power
1,000 homes for an hour.</P>

<P>"Key plants hit by the storm included the Diablo Canyon
nuclear power plant in San Luis Obispo along the Pacific
north of Los Angeles, which was hampered by high surf that
blew sea kelp into its intake valves.</P>

<P>"Storm-tossed waves that could rise as high as 28 feet
forced Diablo Canyon to cut to just 20 percent of normal
output. Each of the station's two 1,100-megawatt
generators provide enough electricity to serve about a
million people."  (((On a positive note, surf's up.)))</P>
