<P>((((To my lasting regret, my home burns natural gas, which
is, at least, much, much better than coal.  I therefore
received the following note this week from my natural gas
supplier.)))</P>

<P>"PREPARE YOURSELF...</P>

<P>This gas bill is probably much higher than in past months
for two reasons.  One reason is the unprecedented increase
in the wholesale price of natural gas.  Natural gas prices
have increased more than gasoline prices.  By law,
Southern Union Gas must pass through our gas cost to you
with <STRONG>no profit.</STRONG>  Unfortunately, these market increases
mean your bill could be more than 50% higher than last
year.</P>

<P>"The other reason is colder weather.  The last three
winters have been warmer than normal.  This winter may be
colder than normal.  Colder weather means you use your
furnace more often and therefore use more gas.  Higher gas
costs, combined with higher consumption, results in a
higher bill."</P>

<P>(((Let's make no mistake here; I'm all in favor of higher
bills for fossil fuels.  In fact, it looks like I
personally will soon be paying <STRONG>less</STRONG> for green
electricity than my Austin compatriots are paying for
dirty fossil fuel power.  It's Viridian Nirvana!</P>

<P>(((Fossil fuel <STRONG> price spikes,</STRONG> however, are a serious
matter.  We may be heading for some.  Not just in
California.  All over the place.)))</P>

<P>(((Here we have some cogent remarks from a prominent
Houston oil and gas investment banker.  If you check
around on his website, you will see that Mr Simmons has a
rather long history of forecasting that his industry will
come apart at the seams. He's kind of morose and
lugubrious, but he's no crank and he has bona-fides as an
analyst.</P>

<P>(((Back in the 1970s energy crisis, the planet wasn't
"running out of oil," but there were severe production and
distribution bottlenecks. The markets went nuts.  With
enough cold weather and the right market psychology, this
could happen again.</P>

<P>(((Let's not succumb to mere paranoia here.  The energy
market doesn't have to be manipulated by any sinister
cabal of top-hat capitalists and OPEC warlords in berets.
On the contrary: in the past few years, the energy markets
have become just as lively and daffy as the stock market.
California's markets are particularly goofy and
dysfunctional, but the other ones aren't that much better.</P>

<P>(((It didn't require the Gnomes of Zurich to create a
weird boom in Yahoo! stock.  A very weird gas-market this
year is a distinct possibility. The necessary fear is
already there on the streets of San Francisco, and gas
reserves are low.  A little nervous "top up the tank"
behavior from the thriving consumerist masses, and an
energy crisis will become a self-fulfilling prophecy.</P>

<P>(((A massive gas shortage is just about the only way that
the utility sector will ever achieve the dizzying stock
heights previously occupied by the dotcoms.  Getting the
population to meekly go along with this would require a
crisis mentality and a lot of blackouts, but there's no
shortage of blackouts.  Blackouts come pretty cheap.)))</P>

<P>U.S. Department Of Energy</P>

<P>Office Of Natural Gas And Petroleum Technology</P>

<P>Strategic Initiatives Workshop, Queenstown Maryland,
December 6, 2000</P>

<P>"OUTLOOK FOR NATURAL GAS:
IS A TRAIN WRECK PENDING?</P>

<P>(...)</P>

<P>"A year ago next week, the National Petroleum Council
(NPC) delivered  to the DOE its benchmark study on the
challenges facing the natural  gas industry. These
challenges result from natural gas becoming the  fuel of
first and only choice for America to grow its use of
electricity (...)</P>

<P>"As one of the authors of this report, I can assure you
that we were  careful not to whitewash the severity of
these challenges, and a  conscious effort was also made
not to frighten the users of natural gas. (...)  (((No no
no... couldn't have 'em frightened!)))</P>

<P>"Over 200 dedicated individuals volunteered significant
time and  expertise to help complete this study on a fast-
track basis. It has  been billed, rightfully, as the most
important study ever completed  on natural gas and its
future.</P>

<P>"It is becoming clearer with  each passing month that we
grossly underestimated the demand  pressures facing
natural gas.(...)  In my opinion, the report grossly
underestimated the number of rigs needed to get these
reserves out of the ground.  (...)</P>

<P>"In early April 2000, the  NYMNEX price of natural gas
edged above $3 and has since not dropped  below that mark.
It only took another month or two for prices to  clear $4.
As soon as hot summer weather arrived, natural gas prices
passed the $5 mark. By late fall, even $5 gas was
beginning to look  like a bargain as $6 to $6.50 prices
swept across the face of North America. $7 was a  ceiling
that lasted one day. Suddenly, it was becoming quite clear
that something had gone wrong with the NPC gas-pricing
model.</P>

<P>"To me, the biggest energy shock of the year is now taking
place in  California, the country's most prosperous and
heavily populated state. At the beginning of this week,
natural gas prices at the California border exceeded $20
per Mcf, an oil price equivalent of over $100 a barrel!
This is not northern Vermont in a blizzard. This is a real
cash price in a mild weather state that happens to be
populated by as many citizens as several European
countries."</P>

<P>((In other words, Mr. Simmons is predicting the California
model on a national scale.)))</P>

<P>"What went so wrong in the world of natural gas in such a
short period  of time? Why were so many aspects of the NPC
study outdated so  quickly? Is all this a temporary
aberration of Mother Nature and  sheer bad luck? Did OPEC
somehow get its hands on our natural gas  energy supply
too?</P>

<P>"Could these high prices soon retreat to their  historical
norms? Or, is there a chance we look back a few years from
now and simply shake our heads at the collective naivete
of so many  throughout the energy world who blissfully
ignored hundreds of  flashing yellow and occasional red
lights about natural gas?"</P>

<P>(((I'm kind of liking this "shaking our heads at
collective naivete" model.   That's what is expected of
California now == "Gee!  What were we thinking!  Of course
we should dutifully export all our wealth to Houston."
And some few among us == Reliant Energy, El Paso Energy,
Dynegy, Duke Energy,  AES,  Southern, Calpine, and Enron
in particular == will be shaking our naive heads all the
way to the bank!)))</P>

<P>"It is time for the industry and  government to take off
their rose colored glasses and stop wishing  for things
that might simply not be in the cards. It is time to begin
preparing a national energy contingency plan for what we
will do if  natural gas supplies cannot grow by any
significant degree."</P>

<P>(((I'm not claiming that Mr Simmon's dark speculations are
going to happen.  Neither is he.  Another warm, mosquito-
ridden Greenhouse Christmas would take the steam out of
the natural gas market in a big hurry.  Fossil fuels were
ridiculously cheap in the 90s, and speculators were
repeatedly punished.  After years of famine in the Clinton
boom, however, the drilling industry really is pretty
decrepit.</P>

<P>(((So let me suggest something.  If you're on Viridian
List, and you were sorta, kinda, thinking of doing
something progressive and ambitious.... One of those
expensive, time-consuming, put-it-off-till-later energy
reform activities... Like, say, a new overcoat for the
water heater, or some solar panels, or maybe a complete
rethink of your entire industrial production system....
You should probably do that now.  It's sure to pay back
eventually, anyhow, so it's not like you're wasting your
money chasing Microsoft downhill.  If you end up price-
spiked to the wall in the Bush years, that investment will
pay back really fast.</P>

<P>(((Doing that now will be much cheaper than doing it when
and if the economy stagflates.  Under those condistions,
the efficiency companies will be overwhelmed with demand.
And the only guys making real money will be pirate
generators == if they can stay out of court, that is.)))</P>

<P><BR>
(((Back to Mr. Simmons:)))</P>

<P>"Over the years, the industry's wonderful can-do attitude,
coupled with an over-cautious mindset that prices will
never rise, created an industry-wide blindness to the many
energy problems looming over the horizon, and the train
wreck about to occur in the energy markets. Too many
problems were ignored for too long. It is a sad commentary
to have to make, but I fear we are now in the early days
of a severe energy crisis that will take at least a decade
to fix."</P>

<P>(((A decade ==  or, let's say, at least one Presidential
Administration.)))</P>

<P>"We are in the early days of a pending winter of
discontent for our energy supplies. Unless mild weather
quickly returns, we seem to be headed for a situation
where gas storage is at the lowest levels ever seen (...)</P>

<P>"If summer weather is hot, particularly in the eastern
third of the U.S., we could see gas storage withdrawals
occurring in the summer months. If this does not happen
this coming summer, it will almost certainly occur a year
later. And, once gas withdrawals begin in the summer, the
U.S. has one winter left before we have run our storage
system dry. Once this occurs, we will be forced to
relegate natural gas to a seasonal use."  (((Ration
coupons!  Yeehaw!)))</P>

<P>(((What's the solution?  Drilling rigs galore!  And money!
Lots and lots!)))</P>

<P>"It needs  realistically high energy prices so we can pay
the construction costs  for what will become an Energy
Marshall Plan to expand and rebuild our energy complex in
the course of the next decade. (...)  No one wants the
energy crisis that is descending across our country, but
it is here."</P>

<P>(((Actually, to judge by utility valuations on Wall
Street, some of us kinda, sorta, <STRONG>do</STRONG> want this energy
crisis. And there doesn't seem to be any real reason for a
market-spike in natural gas to stop at merely
"realistically high."  Was Amazon "realistically high"? If
that behavior happens in the energy sector, it's gonna be
the most exciting thing to happen to energy in a long,
long time.)))</P>
