<H2>1)  A temper-based coffee dispenser.</H2>

<P>Wire a voice recognition chip to a coffee maker.
After you walk into the kitchen the coffee maker says
"good morning".
When you respond, the chip analyzes your tone of voice and
determines how sluggish and moody you are. It adjusts the
"strength" of the coffee to the appropriate level. (Good
for hangovers also).</P>

<P>When someone says, "It's showtime," lights go out in the
room, and a TV and VCR come on.</P>

<P>When one says, "Now this really pisses me off to no end,"
the radio turns on &amp; self-tunes to a preset classical
station.  This is meant to sooth the nerves of the person.</P>

<P>When someone uses a phrase that you don't like (e.g.
same difference, politically correct, tax and spend
democrats,) your watch says, "shut up" or something even
less civil.</P>

<P>You say, "Nice hair," and your watch says,
"cha-cha-cha-chia."  Referring to the Chia pet, of
course.</P>

create mood variations, based on positive or negative
voice tones and keywords.  Words and phrases such  as

<P>Announcing the meme-o-graph!</P>

<P>An agent scours the media sphere hunting for memes. Likely
sites: Salon, U.S. News, New Yorker, The Well, Greening
Earth, Amnesty International, Amazon.com, etc. Memes are
analyzed for strength, weighted and uploaded via wireless
link to a small, attractive, personal device  which
listens to your every word.
<BR></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Whenever a meme is recognized, the device produces a</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>physical sensation. This sensation can be selected as
either pleasant (e.g. a slight odor of pine forest) or
unpleasant (e.g. a small dribble of fluid down your leg).
The user can choose the sensation based on his/her
immediate self conscious relation to membership in the
data stream. Don't want to pass memes? Make it hurt. Want
to shift the balance in the body politic? Give your self
the warm fuzzies every time you say "Carbon dioxide really
makes me mad!"</P>

<P>Variation 2</P>

<P>Announcing the cliche demonstration project!</P>

<P>The Museum is announcing the opening of a new display. The
Rube Goldberg Variation is listening to YOU (apologies to
PDQ Bach). If you say something it recognizes, the
Variation will demonstrate it.</P>

<P>Over time, the Variation will listen to the conversations
within sensor-shot. Any metaphorical phrase that it hears
more than once will be logged. Every week, The Artist will
receive a request from the Variation. The Artist will
create an Actuator which will express the new dominant
phrase of the week. For example, whenever someone says,
"If I had a nickel for every time I...." an Actuator could
dispense a nickel.
<BR></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>The Actuator will be permanently installed to the</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Variation. Over time, the Variation will grow as an open
ended accretion of demonstrations of the cliches uttered
by thousands, tens of thousands, millions of art
consumers. If the project continues for a long time, some
cliches would become obsolete. Individual Actuators would
fall into disuse. Linguistic archeology could be the hobby
of grade schoolers. Writers could read to the Variation,
hoping for no demonstrations. Performance artists could
say things designed to play the Variation. A string of
horrible cliches could create a masterpiece of mechano-
music.</P>

  <DT>Idea</DT><DD>a kitchen which can answer the question "Is there
  anything to eat?" If the fridge-and-cupboard inventory
  system is insufficiently stocked, the system then lists
  registered take-out places, by genre: "Would you like
  Chinese?  How about Pizza?" It then steps the user through
  the selection processes involved in ordering those foods,

<P>YesMan (tm), for use when talking to oneself.  YesMan
responds to phrases like "What do you think of <STRONG>that</STRONG>?"
with a random selection from a set of phrases, such as: "I
think that deserves further consideration," or
"Brilliant!" or "Are you sure you've thought of
everything?"  The level of obsequiousness or criticality
is user-programmable.</P>

<P>Other modules could be inserted, such as the Pocket
Conscience (tm), which responds to statements like "*Now*
what am I supposed to do?" or "Should* I?" with a gentle
reminder to adhere to the user's selected ethical set
(which can range from Machiavellian to Gandhian).  (Some
wags would probably go for the companion Pocket Tempter
(tm)...)</P>

<P>The YesMan could also be expanded at extra cost to include
the Amanuensis (tm) module, which remembers anything
beginning "Remind me to..." and then spits it back out
when you say, "What's next?" or "What now?"  The Networked
Executive Assistant (tm) module would be able to
communicate with the YesMen of your subordinates, whenever
you say "Remind &lt;name of subordinate&gt; to (do something)."</P>

<H2>4) Every model of light plane is different. I want a  general aviation checklist 
processor that is built into</H2>

<P>each airplane. It would be pleasantly surreal if your
plane could read off its own preflight and other
checklists, taking proper action based on a handful of
commands, e.g.: "Start preflight", "Check", "Say again?",
"Details?", "Hold it!".</P>

<P>Less surreal but more practical would be building a little
dongle for this purpose compatible with the Handspring
Visor (which already includes a microphone, but no decent
speaker).</P>

<P>Not having to keep switching attention back and forth
between checklist(s) and the plane is a good thing, and
ought to help student pilots with "bonding" to the
aircraft and internalizing the flow of the routine.</P>

<A NAME="Section_5"> </A>
<H2>5) It's too hard to remember to turn telephone ringers  back on. I wish I could just tell my land line phone to</H2>

<P>shut up; it would turn its ringer off for one of several
selectable intervals, say 1/2 hour, 8 hours, 24
hours or until it stopped hearing snoring and/or "intimate
sounds", re-enabling the ringer later with no further
action required.</P>

<A NAME="Section_6"> </A>
<H2>6) A simple snoring scorer for people who wonder if/how  much they snore, but don't want to wade through hours of</H2>

<P>realtime tape recordings or pay $$$ for a sleep study. In
the morning a little readout tells you how much, how
often, whether there were any patterns suggestive of
apnea, etc. Could also be programmed to say "&lt;your name&gt;,
turn over!" and give the bed a nudge==then record if the
trick worked or not. I could find out if Breathe Right
strips actually work!</P>

  <P>Concept: Roving Greenhouse Flood Victim Locator<BR></P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>These would be small drone boats (probably the nifty fan-
driven types from the bayous in Louisiana) which would be
released in "schools" in an area affected by flooding.
The drones are equipped with loudspeakers.  The voice
recognition would operate in two stages:</P>

<DL>
  <DT>a) Survivor detection</DT><DD>the boats announce their presence
  at public-address volume once every couple of minutes.
  The drone will move towards any noise parsed as human
  speech (filtering out other drone announcements by
  checking for a specific subfrequency), and also send a
  radio message including the drone's current GPS location
  and direction to the detected human voice.
  </DD></DL>

<P>b) Using fuzzy logic calculations on received vocal
volume, the drone will estimate distance to source and
move in.  It will attempt to elicit a response from
identified source, and if it does so successfully, it will
issue another radio message confirming the location of the
survivor, and then begin asking a series of yes/no
questions.  If the drones are large enough to carry
passengers, they can be invited to climb aboard, but the
drone can also ask "yes/no" questions to identify those
survivors who need immediate human assistance - trapped in
a tree by receding water, those who need medical attention
and cannot move, groups of survivors too large to fit on
one drone, etc.  Also, by asking the names of survivors,
the drone could help identify people identified on lists
of the missing to speed the process of contacting family,
etc.</P>

<P>Device #1:
Take the transmitter circuits from a cell phone
and combine them with the bare minimum needed to have a
working Global Positioning System.
<BR></P>

<P>Now wire in the ISD-SR3000 Embedded Speech Recognition
Engine and stick all this along with a good microphone
into the smallest and most indestructable casing
available.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>coordinates and keeps the mike open so that 911 can record
and respond.  Maybe a tiny digital camera could be wired
in as well so 911 can watch.</P>

<P>Device#2:</P>

<P>Life's little soundtrack.
Mount the ISD-SR3000 Embedded Speech  Recognition Engine
on a portable mp3 player and then sort your mp3's by what
mood they put you in, instead of by musician.
<BR></P>

<P>When you say "energized," your player will select at
random a song from the "energized " file, thus helping you
to achieve the mood you want, or giving you a soundtrack
for the mood you are in.</P>

worthwhile if it could be mass produced cheaply and in
staggering numbers (millions?).  Imagine the effect a
couple thousand of these might have amidst urban
strife. Might these floating icons of
innocence not inspire people to calm down and be quiet for

<P>Device #5:</P>

<P>Interactive dvd movie player with the ISD-SR3000 Embedded
Speech Recognition Engine so that FINALLY when you yell at
the TV screen there's a chance the characters might take
your advice for once.
Sample key phrase: "DON'T OPEN THAT DOOR!!!"
Result: dvd switches tracks to scene where the character
actually doesn't open the door. (Perhaps the villain opens
the door while the character is busy thanking the audience
for their help.)</P>

<P>Device #6:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Key phrase: the sound of you snoring.<BR></P>

  <P>Result: the greatly amplified sound of your snores<BR></P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>hammering you awake at which point you stop snoring and
can drift off once again to sweet slumber...
don't know if its better than a poke in the ribs but it
should work at least as well.</P>

<P>Device #7:</P>

<P>Barnacle activism
Build a solar powered device which is as small as you can
make it, camouflaged, and eco-harmless in its components.
This device must be able to spend long periods outdoors
(forever?).
The device should contain, in addition to power system and
the ISD-SR3000 Embedded Speech  Recognition Engine,  a
good microphone == a good loudspeaker  ==
white(red/yellow?) LED'S == minimal circuitry and a
relatively friendly way to permanently attach it to
trees/rocks.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>TRIGGER SOUND: a chainsaw or other small motor.<BR></P>

  <P>RESULT: when triggered the barnacle emits light and<BR></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>HELPING HAND</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>a robotic arm which uses both the ISD-SR3000 Embedded
Speech  Recognition Engine and sonar perhaps.
KEY PHRASE: "hand me ........ that."
RESPONSE: "hand me" activates the arm and its secondary
sensor (sonar?).  Homing in on the speaker, it checks to
see where they have their arm-hand-finger pointed, and
what object is thus described. Upon receiving the command
"that," the robotic arm picks up the object and hands it
to the user.
<BR></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Other trigger phrases such as "no, that,"  "stop," and</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>"put that ... there" would prove invaluable.</P>

<P>Device#16:</P>

<P>The phrase "why am I still up?" should cause every light

off for 4 hours.  Do me a favor and build this one into my
house.</P>

<P>I'm spending a lot of time travelling at the moment
(mostly in Germany),  but I'm having the usual "how do you

A voice activated water pressure &amp; temperature control

that is needed: On; Off; Hotter; Colder; More; Less.</P>

<P>When I check into the hotel, my language of choice should

surface of the coffee?), the pot says 'Coffee pot ==
shutting down'.  Like a snooze alarm, you have five
seconds to say '10 more minutes', or 'half an hour,
please' and the pot replies 'as you wish' and stays on.</P>

<P>The more advanced systems will broadcast a Bluetooth
signal to your TV, computer, Palm Pilot or treadmill
with a two-minute warning, and accept a like signal in
response for a continuance.</P>

<P>My second entry is the Handspring Visor vocoder. When
verbally prompted to' Record', it creates an MP3 of your
spoken notes, or at 'Scheduler', it makes voice-entries in
your calendar.  You can speak the date and time, or it
will recognize 'Today', 'Tomorrow', and the days of the
week and enter it in the appropriate place.  The gee-whiz
feature is when you're in your car, or with your hand on
the front-door handle, and you say "I feel like I'm
forgetting something..."  Whereupon you hear "Would you
like to review your schedule?"

  <P>The questions "What's happening this afternoon?", "Is</P>

<P>today  our anniversary?" and "Was I supposed to pick
something up for dinner tonight?" will access appropriate
keyword-enabled listings.</P>

<P>In the morning, you could also put it in 'Listening' mode.
It records every conversation in a one-minute buffer.
If your name comes up, or 'Honey, ', or 'Now don't
forget,'  it stores the preceding minute and the remainder
of the conversation, which can  be recalled later, when
you're in your office.</P>

<P>horn  is loud and powered by compressed air, and is easily
recharged with a  standard bicycle pump.  The most
efficient key phrase I can think of would  be any number
of four-letter words.</P>

<P>You phone a machine and say "Viridian". The machine
selects an address  at random from a database and prints
and sends a postcard. The postcard  includes details on
how to contact the machine by phone.</P>

<P>The meme is thus proliferated.  I take no responsibility
for postal bills generated from the above  scheme.</P>
