<HR NOSHADE ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="58%">



<P><U>VIRIDIAN FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</U><BR></P>





<P>"Why don't you have the domain www.viridian.com?"</P>



<P>We're not a commercial organization.  Besides, for

two years now, we have shied away from running a website

because it is so much work.</P>



<P>However, our archive in Australia has shut down and

our Danish one is closing.  Plus, we have just gotten

legal possession of <A HREF="../../index.html">www.viridiandesign.org</A>.  With over

two meg of material now (and that's text only), it's time

for us to stop depending on the kindness of strangers

and put our own house in order.</P>



<P>Stay tuned to hear the Pope-Emperor kvetch and moan

for design help.</P>



<P>"How come some people on Viridian List have lots of ^^^^^

and **** after their log-in names?"</P>



<P>Those symbols of achievement are known as "chevrons" (^)

and "stars" (*).  You get a chevron if you send in some

useful piece of information to the list moderator,

<A HREF="mailto:bruces@well.com">bruces@well.com</A>.  If something you create appears publicly

on the Viridian List,  then you receive the highly coveted

star, to symbolize your star turn on the public stage.

The most direct way to receive a star is to enter a

Viridian Design Contest.</P>



<P>People with a lot of stars and chevrons outrank you.  You

should feel confident in devoting respectful attention to

them.</P>



<P>"What's a Viridian Design Contest?"</P>



<P>The contests are opportunities for graphic or conceptual

creativity. Logos, posters, teapots, lamps, that sort of

thing.  We do this to amuse ourselves, and to give some

coherent form to our ideas. Images and symbols are every

bit as important to the Viridian Movement as our constant

outflow of rants.</P>



<P>There's a Viridian contest archive at:

<A HREF="http://www.bomoco.com/Viridian/viridian.htm">http://www.bomoco.com/Viridian/viridian.htm</A>

You can see from this site that Viridian design entries

are not necessarily professional-level efforts in

postindustrial design.  Rather, they're a fun opportunity

to show others that you not only "get it" == you have the

strength and energy to give it back.</P>



<P>You enter a Viridian Design  contest by placing your entry

on a website, and sending the address to the moderator.

The site must be up for the length of the contest. The

winner of the contest receives a prize via snailmail.  The

prizes are modest:  generally classy books and/or nifty

gizmos.</P>



<P>"Where can I read all the Viridian Notes I haven't seen

already?"

Try:

<A HREF="http://www.well.com/conf/mirrorshades/">http://www.well.com/conf/mirrorshades/</A>

(The Bruce Sterling home page)</P>



<P>And feel free to archive everything yourself!  Having just

put those 200 notes in order, I am now in a position to

email the lot of them to anybody who wants them.  Why

not decorate your own website with a free ton of Viridian

propaganda?</P>



<P>You can always show anything you see on Viridian List to

anybody you please.  You need not ask permission, or pay

anyone anything.  If you want to translate it into another

language, be my guest.</P>



<P><BR>

*Do you guys ever <STRONG>make</STRONG> anything, or do you just make

up imaginary stuff?"</P>



<P>We are not a manufacturing or retail enterprise.  However,

we did recently inspire a design contest that may lead up

to a commercial product.

<A HREF="http://sustainer.org/Viridian">http://sustainer.org/Viridian</A></P>



<P>We don't plan to start making meters, chairs, shoes, blimps,

domes, fuel cells, ubicomp chips, smart houses, spongephones,

or any of the other standard Viridian obsessions.  It's like

asking a Broadway critic when he plans to build a theater.</P>



<P>"What's the difference between the Manifesto of January 3,

2000 and "The Manifesto of January 3, 2000"?</P>



<P>In October 1998, I gave a speech in San Francisco,

suggesting that January 3, 2000 would be a good time to

launch a manifesto and start a design movement.  That 1998

speech should henceforth be known as the "Viridian Design

Speech."  The actual Manifesto of January 3, 2000

appeared, just as predicted, on January 3, 2000.  It was a

call to people in all walks of life to put the bad habits

of the 20th century behind them, and to focus their

creative energies on the realities of a new historical

period.</P>



<P>"There seem to be some heavy issues here. I'd like to get

into this at greater length than these Viridian email

essays.  But how?"</P>



<P>Start reading books on the subjects at hand.   We have

quite a few of the classics of ecological and industrial

design listed on

<A HREF="http://www.well.com/conf/mirrorshades/">http://www.well.com/conf/mirrorshades/</A>

You can buy them immediately through our Amazon site. Get

them however you please; but we can testify from personal

experience that those books are worth reading and will not

waste your time.

We're always looking for more such worthy works.  If you

find a work that seems really up our alley, recommend it

to us.

<BR></P>



<P>If you yourself have written a book, we'd like to know

that, too, whether or not it's of direct relevance to

Viridian interests.</P>



<P>"What's the 'Viridian Curia?'"</P>



<P>They're people on Viridian list who've volunteered to

take part in off-line efforts such as Viridian T-shirts,

gizmos, magazine articles, etc.   They're hard-core

zealots who are willing to sacrifice more sustained

attention and effort than other, lesser Viridians.  Their

exalted status is marked with a bishop's crook (?).</P>



<P>"Got any T-shirts left?"</P>



<P>Yeah, a few.  They cost fifteen bucks.  I got a box of 'em

here at the Viridian Vatican.  Some day I may get around

to selling them on Amazon, but this physical meatspace

stuff is mighty daunting to us cyberspace cowboys.</P>



<P>"This doesn't have anything to do with your design

contests, but I'm designing something myself that seems

very Viridian. What now?"</P>



<P>Send in a web address for it.  If it seems relevant to our

interests, we'll list it as a "Viridian Individual

Project"  and post it to the list.  You will receive a

valuable and prestigious star (*).</P>





<P>"Why does every Viridian Note end with those O=c=O marks?"</P>



<P>Those are carbon dioxide molecules.  They're meant to

remind us that the Internet still runs on fossil fuels.

The fossil fuel vice is so deeply embedded that even our

email discussions haplessly contribute to the Greenhouse

Effect.   The reminder helps keep us focussed on our

central concern: we're wrecking the sky.</P>



<P>"How come dates are referred to in Viridian Notes with

an extra zero, like 'October 01998' and 'January 02000'?"</P>



<P>Stewart Brand of Long Now Foundation suggested that this

extra zero would be a good habit to break people loose

from the poverty of short-term thinking.  It suggests the

true depth of history that stretches, not merely behind

us, but ahead of us.</P>



<div align="center"><P>O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O<br>

NO, I HAVE NOT FORGOTTEN THE CONTEST.<br>

TRUST ME, A LOT MORE IS COMING<br>
