Friedrich Nietzsche"The art of progress is to preserve order amid change and to preserve change amid order." Alfred North Whitehead"It is the business of the future  to be  dangerous; and it is among the merits of science that it equips the future for its duties." Alfred North Whitehead"What experience and history teach is this-that peoples and governments never have learned anything from history, or acted on principles deduced from it." G. W. F. Hegel"The historian does simply not come in to replenish the gaps of memory. He constantly challenges even those memories that have survived intact." Yosef Hayim Yerushalmi"History is the most dangerous of all the products of the chemical laboratory of our mind. It stimulates dreaming, it intoxicates nations, it generates in them false memories, exaggerates their reflexes, irritates their old wounds, deprives them of peace and infects them with megalomania or mania of persecution."  Paul Valery"The sudden political revolutions which strike the historian most forcibly are often the least important. The great revolutions are those of manners and thought. The true revolutions, those which transform the destinies of people, are most frequently accomplished so slowly that the historians can hardly point to their beginnings." Gustave LeBon"There is nothing so easy but that it becomes difficult when you do it reluctantly."  Publius Terentius Afer"Man sieht in die Zukunft == und nicht in die Vergangenheit == wenn man seine Kinder anschaut!" Gruene slogan"In individuals, insanity is rare; but in groups, parties, nations, and epochs it is the rule."  Friedrich NietzscheAnd a few others, from *THE VIKING BOOK OF APHORISMS: A Personal Selection* by W. H. Auden and Louis Kronenberger, 1962:"His passions make man live, his wisdom merely makes him last." CHAMFORT"The ardor chills us which we do not share."  PATMORE"The motive for a deed usually changes during its performance; at least, after the deed has been done, it seems quite different."  HEBBEL"All our final resolutions are made in a state of mind which is not going to last."  PROUSTPeople who send us an aphorism expressing a Viridian sensibility will receive a chevron >^<.**********************Table of Contents 1-25**********************Viridian Notes 1-25 (complete with titles, some retroactively bestowed):00001:  Viridian Design Speech00002:  Viridian List Mechanics00003:  Viridian Design Principles00004:  Historical Awareness00005:  Viridian Aesthetics00006:  Floods 100007:  Floods 200008:  The Science Press on Global Warming00009:  The Science Press on Global Warming, Rewritten00010:  Comments from Viridians00011:  Viridian Mascot Contest00012:  Web Links00013:  Link Criticism00014:  Remembrance Agents00015:  Weather Violence00016:  Bio-Refineries00017:  Viridian Aphorisms00018:  The Viridian Model Family00019:  Viridian Domains of Interest00020:  Energy Reform, the Swedish "Solution"00021:  The World Is Becoming Uninsurable, Part 100022:  The World Is Becoming Uninsurable, Part 200023:  The World is Becoming Uninsurable, Part 300024:  Kelly's Koan00025:  German Greens********************Viridian Ranking System********************The Viridian Ranking System has been hand-created with a vintage fountain pen and fine art paper. Scars, flaws, and imperfections add character and are an inherent part of the product.jon@lasser.org^^^^^^**rsewell@cix.compulink.co.uk^^^**jim@smallworks.com^^^^^^^^*dhlight@mcs.net^^^^^^*hinne@spaceways.de^^^^*rinesi@espacio.com.ar^^^^*SeJ@aol.com^^^^*steffen@eskimo.com^^^^*wex@media.mit.edu^^^*whiz@ricochet.net^^^*infinite@beaming.com^*LangiG@parl.gc.ca^*mgoldh@well.com^*me@karmanaut.com^*r1ddl3r@bp13.u.washington.edu^*weasel@gothic.net^*acotter@nonsensical.com*eli@golden.net*hoechst.forum@lrz.uni-muenchen.de*jeffk@well.com*jzero@onramp.net*pinknoiz@pinknoiz.com*richardd@reeseco.com*sethmc@turcotte.colorado.edu*thallad@pcnet.com*tux@powerbase-alpha.com*jonl@well.com^^^^^^tor@araneum.dk^^^^^^pjd@cne.gmu.edu^^^^^Ian.Griffin@Corp.Sun.COM^^^^rdm@test.legislate.com^^^^Cooper409@aol.com^^^cthomas@10fold.com^^^patmazza@teleport.com^^^TuckerV@frogdesign.com^^^bobmorris@mediaone.net^^bperry@shore.net^^bsiano@cceb.med.upenn.edu^^cisler@pobox.com^^dave@va.com.au^^dlandry@rohan.sdsu.edu^^geert@xs4all.nl^^jrc@well.com^^kallen@physics.ucsd.edu^^kirk@mcelhearn.com^^Matt@MediaServ.com^^nehrlich@sfis.com^^pacoid@fringeware.com^^rnedal@olimpo.com.br^^robot@ultimax.com^^rthieme@thiemeworks.com^^tbyfield@panix.com^^thack@design-inst.nl^^WarrenE@aol.com^^xiane@entech.com^^yzl@ucdavis.edu^^Adam@e-gad.com^ASKornheiser@prodigy.net^barlow@eff.org^Basilisk@mcione.com^bperry@shore.net^bigbrain@visi.com^bini@ioc.net^Bprips@aol.com^ccraig@ucsd.edu^Chris.Carroll@turner.com^c.ted.ballou@intel.com^cybercop@sprynet.com^Dan@DanTaylor.com^danny@spesh.com^dc@technomedia.com^figment@sirius.com^fisaza@xinetix.com^gagin@inter.net.ru^gail@well.com^garreau@well.com^ggg@well.com^gordy@nytimes.com^jonny@way.nu^jonwil@primenet.com^jspragens@igc.apc.org^kaiser@acm.org^katie@wtp.net^klilly@neog.com^kosofsky@soback.kornet.nm.kr^louise@hotbot.com^lstinson@empathy.com^mann@cse.unsw.edu.au^melcher@unix.nets.com^merlan@visa.com^mwiik@brysonweb.com^nbodley@tiac.net^philg@martigny.ai.mit.edu^quest@inetarena.com^rafael@master.prossiga.br^richyoung@hotbot.com^rkoster@origin.ea.com^roger@bayarea.net^sblack@library.berkeley.edu^sbweintraub@lbl.gov^shassinger@dev.tivoli.com^steven@iisl.co.uk^sdhurley@ican.net^StJude@aol.com^tdav@wam.umd.edu^tenev@digbody.dux.ru^udhay@pobox.com^viridian@access.spring.net^WEBrawer@greenmap.com^whh@uclink4.berkeley.edu^zooko@wildgoose.tandu.com^
