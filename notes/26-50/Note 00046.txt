Subject:  Viridian Note 00046:  German Bankers Love German GreensKey concepts:  German Greens, fiscal conservatism, coal mining, generational equity, sustainabilityAttention Conservation Notice:  It's blatant propaganda written by a German banker who is making strange-bedfellows overtures to the German Green Party.  We Viridians are probably wasting our attention on this Euro political rhetoric, when we could be discussing something hard, immediate, and practical, like, say, postindustrial aesthetics.Entries in the Viridian "Fungal Typography" Contest:http://members.aol.com/stjude/http://www.saunalahti.fi/~jtlin/viridian/http://www.wenet.net/~scoville/Viridian/viridiantext.htmlhttp://www.erols.com/ljaurbach/http://www.empathy.com/viridian/http://www.spaceways.de/Viridian/Viridiantype.htmlhttp://www.stewarts.org/users/stewarts/viridian.htmlhttp://way.nu/greens/typography.htmlhttp://abe.burmeister.com/viridian2dot1.htmlhttp://rampages.onramp.net/~jzero/viridian/http://www.msys.net/reid/main.htmlandhttp://www.well.com/conf/mirrorshades/nancy.htmlhttp://www.netaxs.com/~morgana/fungus.htmlhttp://www.golden.net/~eli/viridian/http://ucsub.Colorado.EDU/~smcginni/viridian/vfont.htmlThe Viridian Fungal Typography contest is now closed.A winner will be announced shortly.  From: cascio@well.com^^  (Jamais Cascio)Source:  http://www.nytimes.com/yr/mo/day/oped/01hufn.htmlFebruary 1, 1999The Greens vs. Germany's Welfare StateBy MARTIN HUFNERMuch to their surprise and disbelief, some German business leaders have found common ground with their erstwhile worst enemy: the Green Party, which is emerging as the voice of economic reason in the new center-left Government in a number of areas.(((bruces remarks:  Life will swiftly improve if we can just all get over this "surprise and disbelief" nonsense.)))    This stands in stark contrast to the mood right after the election, when the victorious Social Democrats brought their electoral allies, the Greens, into their Government coalition. This raised grave concerns that once the Greens grabbed a little power, they would push an anti-capitalist agenda.((("Grabbed a little power"?  They got elected, okay?)))    In fact, the Greens and their pragmatic leader, Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer, are quite fiscally conservative, more so in many ways than the  Social Democrats and their Finance Minister, Oskar Lafontaine. (A Green politician has characterized Mr. Lafontaine as someone "who is stuck in a totally outdated concept of demand-side economics.")(((Almost as stinging a rebuke as declaring him guilty of "twentieth-century thinking!")))    The Greens, for example, oppose various large subsidies for industries like coal mining == a reform crucial to improving the competitiveness of the German economy.(((Oh happy day!  Diss a carbon-dioxide miner, and suddenly bankers love you!  Who says there's no justice for the righteous?)))    Reform of Germany's famously generous pension system is another instance of the Greens' fiscal sense. While the Social Democrats are determined to undo the very limited scaling back in the pension system by the previous Government, the Greens advocate a firm focus on generational equity. They do not believe it is wise to add to the financial burden of today's and tomorrow's work force.((("Generational equity" at least has the advantage of not being talked-to-death politically.)))     For the Greens, "sustainability" is more than an environmental concept, and relates to financial, economic and social policy as well. They believe that if the level of consumption is not sustainable == be it in the form of deficit spending, the overconsumption of state services or environmental degradation == then policies must change.    The Greens are even sympathetic to the idea that corporate taxes must be revamped to make German business more competitive. Their calculation is simple: financially weak companies cannot make the necessary investments in technologies to protect the environment. The Greens' persistence forced German business to deal with pollution and other problems before other countries did. In fact, environmentally sensitive technologies like oil reclamation are one  of the few areas where German business can claim a dominance comparable to its strong overall position as little as 15 years ago.    Last year, Germany's 18.7 percent share of the world market for environmental technology was larger than that of any other country, including the United States.(((We Viridians like to refer to this as the "Cold War II: Solar-Panel Gap with the Germans" Scenario.)))    In some cases, it is business that has given due consideration to the Greens' way of thinking, rather than vice versa.(((Really?  How unthinkably shocking!)))    Take a party proposal to triple Germany's already high gasoline taxes. Many corporate and financial leaders were aghast. But then again, one cannot escape noticing that, at the very time the idea was floated, Volkswagen introduced its new "Lupo" car that is designed to run on 78 miles per gallon.     From a purely economic point of view, by the time that kind of leap forward in efficiency takes a broader hold in the marketplace, even a tripling of gasoline prices would not impose an additional burden on the average driver.     As advanced industrialized societies, we need to realize that the auto industry can no longer primarily rely on the "bigger and more powerful" mottos of yesteryear. "More intelligent" will do, as we look forward to vastly improved fuel economy and the wider use of information technology tools, like navigation systems. The Greens' policy once again presents a useful measuring rod for car makers' advances.(((In a word, "jawohl.")))    It is true that the Greens' single-mindedness in pursuing their goals has proved highly frustrating to business leaders at times. In retrospect, however, these tough battles yielded a considerable amount of mutual respect.   Even the Greens' more outlandish ideas sometimes make an odd sort of sense.  (...)   As long as Joschka Fischer manages to steer his party in the right direction, the Greens' innate anti-establishment thinking == and their willingness to take on institutions deemed untouchable by others == provides a refreshing element in German politics.    Contrary to all expectations, the Greens have had such a good start in the new Government that it has caused Germany's astute Chancellor, Gerhard Schroeder, to change his own political strategy. Rather than letting them increasingly occupy the center ground in German politics, he is cooperating with them to put an effective check on the Social Democrats' left wing, which has so far resisted reforms. In working more closely with the Greens, Mr. Schroeder may be readying Germany for the changes it needs.Martin Hufner is chief economist of Bayerische Vereinsbank, Germany's second-largest bank.(((Well, this is clearly a cheering scenario for that haunting specter of 21st century Greens  in power.  They're *politicians,* all right?  They have all the standard attitudes, tactics and programmatic alliances that bourgeois politicians always do, except that industry somehow finds ways to make money that don't blatantly ruin the climate.  It doesn't require shock and disbelief to envision this.  There's nothing remotely shocking about it == in retrospect, it's the twentieth-century that's truly unbelievable.)))
