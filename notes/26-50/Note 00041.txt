Subject:  Viridian Note 00041:  The Viridian Product CatalogKey concepts:  imaginary products, Web commerce, Viridian CatalogAttention Conservation Notice:  it's another mad scheme that will probably end up creating a lot of unpaid work for somebody. Over 1,000 words long. Eruptions of Viridian whimsy rather dominate the argument here.Entries in the Viridian "Fungal Typography" Contest:http://members.aol.com/stjude/http://www.saunalahti.fi/~jtlin/viridian/http://www.wenet.net/~scoville/Viridian/viridiantext.htmlhttp://www.erols.com/ljaurbach/http://www.empathy.com/viridian/http://www.spaceways.de/Viridian/Viridiantype.htmlhttp://www.stewarts.org/users/stewarts/viridian.htmlhttp://way.nu/greens/typography.htmlhttp://abe.burmeister.com/viridian1.htmlhttp://rampages.onramp.net/~jzero/viridian/http://www.msys.net/reid/main.htmlThis contest embraces decay on January 31, 01999.  For contest instructions see Note 00027.From: steffen@eskimo.com^^^^^** (Alex Steffen)Bruce:I've always thought that, when possible, one should create the expression of one's ideas and not merely point to another similar idea  (Roethke: "Am I reduced to the indignity of examples?"). (((Absolutely, Alex!   You've hit on a key concept!   There's a growing famine of personal originality in our fin-de-siecle culture.   Given our unprecedented capacity to store-and-forward digitized information, it's become fatally easy for us to pass the intellectual buck, by cutting-and-pasting an idea, rather than  internalizing it, thinking it through, and expressing  it in our own authentic  voice.  We're committing an intellectual sin here; we're substituting information for  thought, and communication for comprehension. We  take comfort in the illusion of control that comes with  the frenetic scutwork of using computers and the Net. That's a very cogent issue for contemporary thinkers, and if I took a couple of days and really developed this idea until I grasped it fully and made it my own, I think I might have something really original and illuminating to offer the debate.    (((But...  Well, it's more efficient to refer you to a recent paper that explores a very similar phenomenon in a really provocative way.  The URL  is right here on my hotlist...  Darn, I was sure I had that site bookmarked... Wait a sec, I think I had it downloaded in this folder...   Yeah, here it is....   Oh wait, no, that's the right author but  that's not the piece that I remember...  Let me do a FIND  search of the whole disk... No, that's not the right Windows drive, I guess....  My wife's got SHERLOCK on her gumdrop  machine upstairs,  but it's not worth it to interrupt her.... Well, we just don't have time, I guess.  What were you saying?)))    It would clearly be nice for Viridians to redesign our artistic and material cultures, our cities and homes, and while we're at it, certain aspects of our political system as well, and all by the kick-off date in Jan. 3, 2000. I find this unlikely, however.(((Oh ye of little faith *8-/ )))    That being the case, perhaps a catalog of Things Viridian, Nearly-Viridian and Viridian-leaning is a good start. I think about how influential the old Sears catalogs were at the turn of the century, or the Whole Earth Catalog in the late sixties, and I see a potentially useful tool for Viridian outreach.    To look at the underside first:  much work; perhaps (again like the Whole Earth catalogs) quickly obsolete; publishing things on a short time frame is difficult; the variety of almost-Viridianisms might obscure the search for things actually Viridian; etc.    The advantages would be: looking at catalogs is fun for many, many people; we don't actually have to invent all this crap, just document it; we'll have wider dissemination of some good ideas, the further elucidation of what "Viridian" means and might come to mean, a template for further thought and exploration; it's an opportunity to both capture attention to Viridian principles (by releasing the catalog and being willing to discuss it with media, etc.) and to provide regular people some opportunity to connect to those principles (by getting the catalog). It needn't even be a retail operation: merely compiling the list of good stuff will have beneficial effects.(((Philippe Starck's got a catalog of the ilk you describe, but you can *buy* the stuff.  Giving people a catalog of cool, enticing stuff that they can't even purchase is so cruel and annoying as to be almost satirical.)))    Nor need it be confined to material culture. It could, like the old Whole Earth catalogs, include ideas and connections to people as well.(((Did you ever see those grainy b&w photos of huge crowds of semi- and un-paid staffers in the *backs* of those old Whole Earth Catalogs?  There were swarms of 'em, laboring away in this drafty shack in Sausalito, trying to survive on granola and volleyball.)))   In fact, as I've thought about this, the idea which excites me the most is a catalog of things which don't exist yet, but should.(((Wait a minute == now you're on to something.)))    An idea  worth kicking around? You tell me.    (((Sure. This is the kind of idea you can't kick just once.  The Web is starting to finesse the org problems in certain ways, like Amazon.com for instance.  You can do a private catalog of books on your own website.   Bezos cuts you in for some calculated fraction of the action while his analog-world  distribution elves do all the heavy lifting, sorting and straining. I'm tempted to engage in a little Viridian web-commerce there, if only to give people a handy place to swiftly accumulate a Viridian-approved design library.  If it made any money, I could blow it on Big Mike giveaway mousepads.    (((A website listing Viridian-approved real-world products would be an excellent idea, especially if it had links to sites where these objects could be purchased on the web.  We make no money through all this earnest recommendation, but neither did Whole Earth Catalog.  This list would require a lot of grooming and maintenance, but not impossible amounts.   (((However, the idea of a core Viridian catalog of Viridian *conceptual art* consumer products sounds trulyinspired.  Because we don't manufacture them.  We don't engineer them.  We don't retail them.  We don't ship them.  We don't store them.  We don't do tech support.  We just *make up cool things that we want.*  Then we hold Viridian Contests to create the best *graphic image* of this imaginary consumer object.  Then we write some glowing ad copy about it, and append an imaginary price.    (((We could publish a commercial-style snailmail paper catalog of this kind, and leave it lying around in dentists' offices.  I think that if handled properly, a prank Viridian publication of this kind could cause unsuspecting people to blow a mental thermionic valve.  Leveraged correctly, their frustration of not being able to buy these products would be transmuted into a holy rage at the fact that these things didn't yet exist.  They would demand for them to come into being!    (((In the next Viridian Note, I will offer up a potential candidate for a Conceptual Viridian Product.)))Alex Steffen (steffen@eskimo.com^^^^^**)
