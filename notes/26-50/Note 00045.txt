Subject: Viridian Note 00045:  Twentieth-century ThinkingKey concepts:  the 20th century, inflexible theory, short-term exploitation, bipolar politics, militarism, weather warfareAttention Conservation Notice:  It condemns other people's old-fashioned theoretical thinking, but it's still written in theorese.  It also contains a large unreadable chunk of absurd military rhetoric.Entries in the Viridian "Fungal Typography" Contest:http://members.aol.com/stjude/http://www.saunalahti.fi/~jtlin/viridian/http://www.wenet.net/~scoville/Viridian/viridiantext.htmlhttp://www.erols.com/ljaurbach/http://www.empathy.com/viridian/http://www.spaceways.de/Viridian/Viridiantype.htmlhttp://www.stewarts.org/users/stewarts/viridian.htmlhttp://way.nu/greens/typography.htmlhttp://abe.burmeister.com/viridian2dot1.htmlhttp://rampages.onramp.net/~jzero/viridian/http://www.msys.net/reid/main.htmlandhttp://www.well.com/conf/mirrorshades/nancy.htmlThis contest embraces decay on January 31, 01999.  From: tbyfield@panix.com^^^* (Ted Byfield)Ted Byfield remarks:Describing someone or something as "nineteenth-century"can be a simple way of encapsulating a certain kind ofold-fangledness. So, in preparation for the new century, I made a new year's resolution to practice dismissing things as "twentieth-century."      Good targets might be: inflexible theoretical programs that put domination of something before involvement with it; short-term exploitation where long-term cultivation is needed; psychologistic twaddle about "motives" (only "enemies" have "motives," "we" have "reasons"); any political distinction that emphasizes categories such as "left" or "right" over the specifics of a situation (if Jerry Falwell or Idi Amin has a good idea, so much the better); and so on.     It's easy to think of stupid twentieth-century ideas that have caused incalculable destruction for no good reason.   Of course, dismissing something as "twentieth-century" isn't as productive as coming up with a clear program for the twenty-first century. But it's a method of identifying things that suck so badly that I really should stop devoting much attention to their inner workings.  With a little luck, my newfound attention-surplus will let me focus on things that are more pleasurable, fruitful, and considerate. I think those are Viridian virtues.    The quote that follows seems like a very good example of "twentieth-century" nonsense: it's an abstract of a US Air Force paper arguing that "owning the weather" == specifically, manipulating climate to screw the enemy == is a good idea.    Understand: if these people would devote their resources to battling the desertification of Africa, or otherwise greening some distressed area, that would be excellent. It would be sadly twentieth-century to oppose a weather technology merely because it's  "technology;" but it's very twenty-first century == maybe even Viridian == to technically cultivate habitability, even if you can't predict the politics of those who end up living there.Ted Byfieldhttp://www.au.af.mil/au/database/research/ay1996/acsc/96-025ag.htmTitle:  [2025] Weather as a Force Multiplier: Owningthe Weather in 2025 Subject:  Military applications ofweather modification in 2025.

Such a capability offers thewarfighter tools to shape the battlespace in ways neverbefore possible. It provides opportunities to impactoperations across the full spectrum of conflict and ispertinent to all possible futures. The purpose of thispaper is to outline a strategy for the use of a futureweather modification system to achieve militaryobjectives rather than to provide a detailed technicalroad map.A high risk/high reward endeavor, weather modificationoffers a dilemma not unlike the splitting of the atom.While some segments of society will always be reluctantto examine controversial issues such as weathermodification, the tremendous military capabilities thatcould result from this field are ignored at our ownperil. From enhancing friendly operations or disruptingthose of the enemy via small-scale tailoring of naturalweather patterns, to complete dominance of globalcommunications and counter-space control, weathermodification offers the warfighter a wide range ofpossible options to defeat or coerce an adversary.Technology advancements in five major areas arenecessary for an integrated weather modificationcapability: (1) advanced nonlinear modeling techniques,(2) computational capability, (3) information gatheringand transmission, (4) a global sensor array, and (5)weather intervention techniques. Some interventiontools exist today and others may be developed andrefined in the future.Current technologies which will mature over the nextthirty years will offer anyone who has the necessaryresources the ability to modify weather patterns andtheir corresponding effects, at least on the localscale. Current demographic, economic, and environmentaltrends will create global stresses that provide theimpetus necessary for many countries or groups to turnthis weather modification ability into a capability. Inthe US, weather modification will likely become a partof national security policy with both domestic andinternational applications. Our government will pursuesuch a policy, depending on its interests, at variouslevels. These levels could include: unilateral actions,participation in a security framework such as NATO,membership in an international organization such as theUN, or participation in a coalition. Assuming that in2025 our national security strategy includes weathermodification, its use in our national military strategywill naturally follow. Besides the significant benefitsan operational capability would provide, anothermotivation to pursue weather modification is to deterand counter potential adversaries.In this paper we show that appropriate application ofweather modification can provide battlespace dominanceto a degree never before imagined. In the future, suchoperations will enhance air and space superiority andprovide new options for battlespace shaping andbattlespace awareness. "The technology is there,waiting for us to pull it all together;" in 2025 we can"Own the Weather."Last updated 1997 Oct 09(((Bruce Sterling remarks:  this squib is pure science-fictional power fantasy. That's pretty big talk from a military establishment that's terrified of punjee sticks.  Still, I'm no longer surprised to find way-out 1960s-style lunacy in US military circles, even in the highest levels of command.  After the cloud-cuckoolands of military virtual reality and Information Warfare theory, nothing surprises me.  (((The most interesting aspect of the modern American military is its detachment from the market process.  The military is one of the last American institutions that isn't baldly and directly for sale.  The US Armed Forces can no longer fully command their own dedicated industrial base == they're forced to use common off-the-shelf stuff now,  the poor wretches even have to run battleships on Windows 95 == but there's still a touching assumption there that *the military* should properly command the mighty forces of nature, and that *nobody else ever will.*  (((The notion of on-the-spot, to-order weather modification is about as likely as telepathy. It'll never happen == but it's the frame-of-mind that's of interest to us here. As an exercise in *late* twentieth-century thinking, one could easily re-write the above militant screed in neo-liberal digital free-marketese.  "Thanks to the market privatization of the weather, a new day of consumer convenience is dawning!  Thanks to emergent technology, focussed product development, and advanced nonlinear modelling techniques, ordering your own personal thundershower will soon be as easy as point-and-click."  Yeah, right, surely.)))
