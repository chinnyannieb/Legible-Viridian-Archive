"Some Wisconsin Residents Oppose New Wind Turbines"
<P>
"GREGORVILLE, Wisconsin == Ken Loeber had no objections
when he first heard about plans to build a wind farm near
his home in Kewaunee County. The 51-year-old artist moved
here in the early 1970s for the peace and quiet. When a
utility started talking about the project, he had visions
of watching state-of-the-art wind turbines silently making
electricity in this breezy corridor south of Door County.
<P>
"'Now it's more like we are living in an industrial park,'
Loeber said from the living room of his log cabin, a few
hundred yards from the closest spinning turbine. 'It's so
noisy that, some nights, we can't open our windows. But I
think that now that they are up, they placed them far too
close to people's homes.'
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "Even though they don't belch smoke or pose the
</BLOCKQUOTE>
potential danger of a nuclear power plant, Wisconsin wind
farms are generating something else == local opposition.
The tall towers, with their hypnotic, rotating blades,
strike many as a cool way to make electricity. But some of
the people who live nearby believe their quality of life
is being buffeted by these new contraptions, which rise
more than 30 stories to capture the best winds.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "Wisconsin Public Service and Madison Gas &amp; Electric
</BLOCKQUOTE>
have erected 31 turbines in the towns of Lincoln and Red
River along an outcropping that produces the highest
sustained winds in the state. The Danish-built machines
represent the largest concentration of wind generation
east of the Mississippi River.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "Those who are bugged by the projects say the turbines
</BLOCKQUOTE>
are too loud, foul up TV reception and ruin the night sky
with their flashing red lights. For some residents, when
the sun hugs the horizon, the shadows from the twirling
blades create a strobe-light effect that can turn a walk
across the living room into a bad rock-concert experience.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "We were getting these shadows in the afternoon and
</BLOCKQUOTE>
now, as the sun moves lower in the sky, we're getting them
in the morning,' said Julie Thiry, who can see turbines
from both her kitchen and her living room. 'It's terrible.
You have to keep doing double takes.'
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "Both Wisconsin Public Service and MG&amp;E say they are
</BLOCKQUOTE>
working to fix the problems. 'It's a big deal whenever
someone is unhappy with what we do,' says Gregory Bollom,
a market planner for the Madison utility. 'As elegant as
some people think a wind turbine is, they are still a
machine, and some people aren't going to like it.'"
<P>
(((bruces remarks:  Now for another design issue, the
downside of the Viridian Ranking System. As the Viridian
list grows larger, it becomes more valuable in attention
terms, so strangers are increasingly eager to exploit it.
Such was the case recently when a list subscriber
industriously removed all the anti-spam chevrons and stars
from people's log-in addresses, and invited them to join
an unmoderated pseudo-Viridian mailing list, run on
egroups.com.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  (((Unmoderated mailing lists are, of course,
</BLOCKQUOTE>
profoundly anti-Viridian by their nature.  Their design
limitations necessarily makes them attention hogs of the
first order. Some people trusting enough to respond to the
friendly and cunningly worded invitation are now emitting
screams of anguish directed at the Pope-Emperor. For
instance:)))

Hey Bruce,<BR>
I really enjoy your Viridian newsletters.
I like the movement.<BR>
I write you HORRIFIED by the INCREDIBLE amount of
redundant email I get from having joined this e-group. Had
I known what such a move entails I would've NEVER joined.
Now I don't know how to stop them!
I just spent an hour going through DOZENS of emails...some
of them quite stupid...many of them just REDUNDANT.
Please help me get away from these people.
I have to go now as this public Library closes in 1
minute.<BR>
I really can't stand this Viridian SPAM.
<P>
(((For the record, you get off egroups lists by mailing
egroups.com.  For this pseudo-Viridian imposture, try
viridian-d-unsubscribe-(your email address)@egroups.com.
Maybe that'll work.  I'm praying for you.
<P>
(((Enthusiasm for the Viridian List should not blind one
to the fact that we are still on the Internet. Yes, I can
protect you from utter gibberish in the lists that I
myself edit.  But! If you trustingly wander into the
Internet's outer darkness, it's at your own peril.  I
believe that the Viridian Ranking System gives us a
refreshing sense of community solidarity, rewards creative
effort, and adds to the value of list discussions.  But
there is a downside: people who glimpse your log-in name
can tug your chain, if they're in the mood to try it.  In
case of future incidents, and there are likely to be some,
keep in mind that "Viridian" traffic is never Viridian
unless it comes directly from fringeware.com or
