(((It has been remarked that BP Amoco's policies "sound
like Greenpeace had invaded the executive suite."  In
point of fact, Greenpeace <strong>has</strong> invaded BP Amoco's
executive suite.  In response, BP Amoco, in the person of
its Gorbachevian leader Sir John Browne, has launched a
vigorous "charm offensive.")))
<P>
"None of Us Lives in a Vacuum"
<P>
by John Browne, Chief Executive Officer of BP Amoco.
<P>
<P>
"The oil and gas industry is in the middle of a
revolution, one taking place on five or six different
fronts.  After 70 years with an almost unchanged corporate
structure among the major oil companies, the industry has,
in the last two years, seen four major transformations in
the United States and Europe, and a host of smaller
linkups. (...)
<P>
<P>
"These mergers and acquisitions don't constitute an
endgame; the industry is not shrinking.  Demand for oil is
12 percent higher than it was a decade ago.  Gas demand is
30 percent higher.  And with nuclear developments again in
question it seems certain that hydrocarbons will meet the
bulk of the world's new energy demand for the forseeable
future.  The geography of the industry is changing, too.
Incremental demand for energy comes predominantly from
Asia, driven by population growth and rising living
standards.
<P>
<P>
"We are seeing a new balance of fuels take shape.
The demand for natural gas has doubled since the early
1970s and is set to double again by 2020, partly because
gas is more environmentally friendly == for equivalent
electricity output, gas generates less than half the
emissions produced by coal.
<P>
<P>
"As part of China's celebrations of the 50th
anniversary of the revolution, the Chinese adjusted the
use of some of the coal-fired industrial plants around
Beijing. In a city that is often covered by a blanket of
smog, people could see what they were celebrating.
<P>
<P>
"That story is just one example of a new set of
expectations.  People want energy, because energy means
liberty, mobility, growth and the chance to improve living
standards.  But people want a clean environment, too.  Yet
at the moment consumers and government seem to be in
denial.  They refuse to accept their own responsibility
for increasing costs to the quality of life which are
imposed when we all demand more.  And they deflect that
responsibility onto the oil and gas sector."
<P>
<P>
(((I'm in extensive agreement with the "denial" part,
but the oil and gas sector is held responsible by
consumers and government because the industry owns and
maintains the means of production.  We consumers are
pulling the nozzles and flipping the switches, but we're
extensively and deliberately divorced from the day-to-day
realities of running derricks and supertankers.  If we all
had desktop oil refineries, then the energy industry would
have a very different structure of responsibility.)))
<P>
<P>
"There are no simple and easy answers to global
warming, traffic congestion, air quality and waste
disposal.  Oil companies can't solve these problems on
their own.  But we can make a contribution as part of a
common effort.  We all need to take measures that
transcend the apparent == and unacceptable == trade-off
between better living standards and pollution.
<P>
<P>
"Take climate change.  I disagree with those in our
industry who believe that the only answer to climate
change is to question the science, deny responsibility and
ignore reality. (((Viva!  VIVA!  VIVA!)))  Of course, the
science is provisional; there are many things we do not
know.  But it is an undeniable truth that people link
energy to pollution, that they fear for the environmental
future and that they believe companies should raise their
aspirations.  We did some polling; when asked whether they
associate energy with progress or pollution, almost 40
percent of respondents say the first association is with
pollution. But 80 percent believe that business has the
ability and the responsibility to find answers."
<P>
<P>
(((Well, it's the truth as far as it goes, and it's
good of him to 'fess up to it.  I would have liked to hear
a little more about the climatic reality, and a little
less about the polling.  It's not a problem of aspiration,
it's a problem of respiration.  Thirty percent more CO2 in
the atmosphere can't be wished away with better corporate
public relations.  Energy will mean "liberty, mobility,
growth" as well as "progress" only when energy no longer
pollutes.)))
<P>
<P>
"We can't afford to disappoint them.  That's why, in
a speech at Yale last year, I committed BP to reducing our
own emissions of greenhouse gases by at least 10 percent
from a 1990 base by the year 2010.  Because our business
is growing rapidly, that is a reduction of more than 40
percent from the level we would have reached if we took no
action at all.  And it's why we've pledged this year to
introduce new clean fuels in at least 40 cities around the
world by the end of the year 2000."
<P>
<P>
(((This seems to me like a profoundly effective
public-relations move.  It works because we are all
thoroughly implicated in carbon abuse.  A small scrim of
dissidents exist, but the masses as a whole are mortgaged
to combustion in the way that Soviets were to mass
factories and collective farms.  So: have <strong>you</strong> reduced
your <strong>own</strong> emission of greenhouse gases "by 10 percent
from a 1990 base"?  You haven't done that?  Then by what
conceivable right can you criticize those noble souls at
BP Amoco?  You should sit down and shut up!)))
<P>
<P>
"But our decisions on global warming and clean fuels
also taught us a larger truth.  We learned that for a
company like ours == indeed, for any international company
with a large number of highly skilled employees == top
management can no longer expect to make policy in a
vacuum.  When we accepted that, on the evidence, global
warming was a true problem, we did so in  part because our
own employees had told us that we couldn't go on living in
denial.  Their families, and their children in particular,
believed we were <strong>part</strong> of that problem.
<P>
<P>
"Our staff found it intolerable that we seemed to be
on the wrong side of a fundamental issue.  I have never
received so many personal e-mails from BP Amoco employees
as I did after announcing our new policy.  A few weeks
later we asked all our teams for their direct support, so
that we could identify ways of reducing our own emissions.
I got hundreds of pages of e-mail from people all around
the world with detailed practical suggestions."
<P>
<P>
(((Hurray, hurray, not just for the BP-Amoco children
== tomorrow's little consumers == but for the engineers
who dare to have a conscience and some foresight.
<P>
<P>
(((There must be Viridian readers out there who
cynically believe that oil company personnel (hundreds of
thousands of technically educated people all over the
planet) are terminally afflicted with  false-
consciousness.  They somehow want to see their own
children stew in a Greenhouse world.  Nobody's eager to
reform themselves out of a job, admittedly. But it's other
wrong and evil to deny other human beings any capacity for
intelligence and reform.  What Browne says about his
industry's 70-year stagnation is true.  And the revolution
he describes is a real one.  The fate of the giant oil and
gas enterprise is up for grabs to an extent unseen in many
decades.
<P>
<P>
(((When Maid Marian showed up in Sherwood Forest,
cynics would have hanged her for being an aristocrat.  If
we want energy perestroika instead of a Greenhouse Terror,
we have to wisely exploit the growing disorder inside the
castle.   Sir John says he wants to reform; he's taking
concrete steps to reform; he's deliberately and publicly
cut himself out of the Greenhouse-denial pack; so he
deserves a hearing and should be taken at face value.
Certainly the Greenhouse-denial industry is in no doubt
about his intentions:  they hate, fear and vilify John
Browne for daring to break ranks.)))
<P>
<P>
"The old order, symbolized by the remote and arrogant
corporation, convinced of its own virtue and
invincibility, is passing.  The new order is neither
comfortable nor predictable; but it reminds us that
companies, however big, are simply servants of society.
We exist only because somebody wants to buy what we
provide.  In a complex world, the companies that thrive
will be those that can combine the traditional strengths,
like a strong financial balance sheet and a great
portfolio of assets, with something new: the capacity to
listen and to learn."
<P>
(((Hear hear.  God bless us every one.  Merry Xmas.)))
