Key concepts: Internet energy consumption, growth rates,<BR>
carbon consumption, new economy
<P>
Attention Conservation Notice:  It's a struggle for cyber
hearts-and-minds as the policy wonks of the sustainable,
"cool companies" crowd take on the loathsome pseudoscience
of the Greening Earth Society.  Part one of three.

"Planet Warming to the Internet"
<P>
"3:00 a.m. 11.Dec.1999 PST<BR>
"WASHINGTON == Shop online and save the Earth.
<P>
"That is the holiday message offered by Dr. Joseph Romm
and the Center for Energy and Climate Solutions. On
Friday, Romm pointed to a number of ways in which
increasing use of the Internet is saving energy and
resources, and helping to slow the impact of global
warming.
<P>
<P>
"Romm and the center have written a report called 'The
Internet Economy and Global Warming: A Scenario of the
Impact of E-Commerce on Energy and the Environment.' The
report, released today, details how computers are
revolutionizing the US economy, and leading to drastic
changes in how Americans work, live, and spend their
money.
<P>
<P>
"'The Internet economy could allow a very different
type of growth than we have seen in the past,' said Romm,
the center's director and lead author of the report. 'It
means that there is also a new energy economy that will
have profound impacts not only on the environment, but
also economic forecasting.'
<P>
<P>
"Romm, who previously headed the US$2 billion energy
efficiency and renewables program for the Department of
Energy, says recent data on economic growth and energy use
illustrate a dramatic shift in the focus of Americas
economy.
<P>
<P>
"'The years of 1997 and 1998 saw the biggest drop in
energy use in 50 years,' Romm said, 'without a rise in
energy prices.' (...)  No longer, Romm says, is a thriving
economy inextricably linked to energy-gobbling industries.
<P>
<P>
"The reason, he says, is e-commerce. Entire
businesses are now built on foundations of electrons,
instead of bricks and mortar. And that saves energy in all
three of the major components of the economy:
construction, manufacturing, and transportation. Each of
these sectors is experiencing substantial impacts from
electronic commerce, and Romm thinks they are only
experiencing the tip of the cyber-iceberg.
<P>
<P>
"(...) e-commerce does not need nearly as much floor
space as traditional retailers and wholesalers. Businesses
that sell online do not need to build actual stores where
customers can browse; they can display their wares in
cyberspace, and store and ship them from just a few
locations.
<P>
<P>
"A recent EPA analysis concluded that (...) standard
estimates for US energy and carbon dioxide emissions in
2010 may be overstated by the equivalent of 175 power
plants and 300 million metric tons of CO2.
<P>
<P>
"(...) by 2007, consumer and business e-commerce
could remove the need for 1.5 billion square feet of
office space == about 5 percent of the nation's total ==
along with up to 1 billion square feet of warehouses.
Internet technology may also eliminate as much as 2
billion square feet of commercial office space == the
equivalent of almost 450 Sears Towers.
<P>
<P>
"Some companies are using the Internet to help
determine what people really want to buy, so that they can
avoid making goods that no one wants. Many computer
companies now let consumers pick and choose what
components to include in their new computers, which allows
the company to better determine what items consumers
value, and reduces the number of unwanted components
taking up warehouse space.
<P>
<P>
"'There's no bigger expense of energy than
manufacturing the wrong product, shipping it to a
warehouse and having it sit there,' says Romm.
<P>
<P>
"Other companies are 'recycling' goods that are
already built. Online auction houses sell millions of
dollars in pre-owned items. By buying used goods, buyers
avoid encouraging the consumption of raw materials. (...)

(((But what about the Internet itself? one naturally asks.
In our next Note, some highly welcome work from actual
physicists.)))
