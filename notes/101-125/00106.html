"Do-it-yourself climate prediction
<P>
"Anyone with a home PC could join climate modellers in
their attempt to forecast how the Earth's climate will
evolve in the next century"
<P>
by Myles Allen (<A HREF="mailto:m.r.allen@rl.ac.uk">m.r.allen@rl.ac.uk</A>)
<P>
(((Myles Allen is:  "Space Science and Technology
Department, Rutherford Appleton Laboratory, Chilton,
Didcot,OXON OX11 0QX Britain.  NERC Advanced Research
Fellow and Head, Climate Dynamics Section; Visiting Fellow
in Atmospheric, Oceanic and Planetary Physics, University
of Oxford."  In other words, the real article!  Not a
crank!  It's a serious pitch!)))

"As long as politicians only propose targets that they
think they can sell to a generally indifferent electorate,
it seems unlikely that we will achieve the order-of-
magnitude reductions in greenhouse-gas emissions required
to make a significant impact on the problem.  And as long
as climate research remains  confined to large,
centralized institutions, this indifference is likely to
remain. (...)
<P>
"Hundreds of thousands of 50-year integrations would be
required to explore all the relevant parameter
combinations in a full-scale climate model.  This is well
beyond the capacity of current or planned modelling
facilities.  Or is it? (...)
<P>
"More than a million volunteers are currently scanning
radio-telescope data on their home PCs for sings of
extraterrestrial intelligence.  Could a similar number be
recruited for the more practical, albeit more demanding,
task of forecasting the climate of the twenty-first
century? (...)  This in itself would be helpful for
counteracting the powerful lobby still promoting the
notion that there is nothing to worry about. (...) The
ability to perform million-member ensemble simulations,
even at relatively coarse resolution, would profoundly
affect climate modelling."
<P>
(((The sublime grandeur of this concept speaks for itself.
While climate models are not a panacea, there's no
question that Viridian computers should be chewing this
data in their spare time. We've got the machinery, this is
our cause, and this well-meaning British scientist needs
popular encouragement to get his proposal off the ground.
Go hit his website, sign up now, and tell everybody you
know.)))
