to dwell on massive unnatural weather disasters in hugely
populated, poverty-stricken areas.

Situation reports by Indian disaster mitigation crews on
the ground in Orissa. Mostly concerns plastic sheeting,
candles, bags of rice and  the endless gruesome labors of
the carcass disposal crews.<BR>

Amateurish disaster snapshots look like peasants wading at
the seaside until you realize that the "sea" isn't
supposed to be there.
<P>

<P>
The "Orissa Super Cyclone" of October 30, 1999 is now
recognized as the worst Indian weather disaster in 100
years.  The Indian relief efforts are well-nigh paralyzed
by broken infrastructures and partisan bickering.
<P>
The Internet to the rescue!<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.causeanaffect.org/">http://www.causeanaffect.org/</A>
<P>
"Our sponsors pay for your donation, which you can make
once every day.  REMEMBER! Your one click will save a
life! Your click is precious, save it for a life!"
<P>
<P>
Imagine!  Merely clicking some website and, at no cost
to yourself, swiftly aiding and succouring some distant
sufferer. Is this too good to be true?  Well, yes, it is,
basically.
<P>
<P>
Diverting revenue from Indian advertising into the
hands of Indian charities is clearly an improvement on
doing nothing.  But the scope  of this disaster is so huge
that mere cash can scarcely get a grip on it.  It's a
titanic, heartbreaking mess in a place that was a titanic
mess to begin with.  They still don't even have a body
count, though certain officials in Orissa publicly imagine
it to be as high as 100,000.
<P>
<P>
The web volunteers who came forth with the innovative
"click to save a life" pitch are from "Iridium
Interactive."  This Indian web design company apparently
has nothing to do with the Iridium satellite phone.  Among
their other design efforts are a graphology handwriting
analysis site and a site for a "pranic healing" health
guru.  I'm afraid we have to classify
<A HREF="http://www.causeanaffect.org/">www.causeanaffect.org</A> as a harbinger of things to come
rather than a genuine solution.

From the e-commerce angle, one might pick up some groovy
bhangra dance CDs and Bollywood videos at "Indus Live:"
<P>
"'Orissa Relief:' From now through December 31 1999,
induslive.com will donate all proceeds from the music
store to the Orissa Flood/Typhoon Relief Fund. Please join
us in aiding the efforts in Orissa."
<P>
<P>
Plus, Induslive features streaming net.radio with
keening soundtracks from one's favorite Indian popstars.
Consider this a mouse-clicking vote of confidence in the
awesome creative vitality of the Indian people, who have
historically shrugged off calamities that would obliterate
ten lesser nations.
<P>
No Viridian Disaster can be complete without some uncanny,
freakish tale of infrastructure wreckage.
<P>
"Research at ILS Hampered by Cyclone
<P>
<P>
"The Institute for Life Sciences (ILS) in Orissa is the
only centre in the country where extensive research is
being carried out on Molecular Biology of Malaria,
Photosynthesis, Stress Biology and Heavy Metal Toxicity.
But the cyclone and knee-high rain water which entered the
laboratories has laid waste much of the research. (...)
They were carrying out research on transgenic plants to
develop drought resistant varieties which  would have been
useful for drought-prone areas of Orissa. (..)
<P>
<P>
"The scarce enzymes and chemicals which are stored at
minus 20 degree centigrade and minus 70 degree centigrade
were destroyed when the freezer did not function due to
lack of power supply for more than five days. (...) The
damage has pushed research back by eight years, said its
director Prof. AP Dash. He said apart from research work,
rare samples of fatal diseases and animals and plants had
perished. (...)  Meanwhile, the authorities have warned
that if both the Centre and State Government do not
immediately come to its rescue, the 18-year-old autonomous
research organisation will cease to function."
