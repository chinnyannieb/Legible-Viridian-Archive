LJ Aurbach remarks: Another Viridian Disaster in an
ongoing series. Note that Villahermosa is labeled an "oil
town." Also note the usual description, "worst natural
disaster of the decade." Sounds like "greasy, smoky
fingerprints" to me!

Crocodiles Invade Mexican Flood Disaster Zone
<P>
"VILLAHERMOSA, Mexico (Reuters) == Crocodiles have invaded
the southeastern Mexican city of Villahermosa since
torrential rains covered about three-quarters of it with
water.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "Environmental authorities said Friday that they had
</BLOCKQUOTE>
trapped nine crocodiles, ranging from 3 to 8 feet in
length.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "An oil city of 465,000 people and the capital of
</BLOCKQUOTE>
tropical Tabasco state, Villahermosa lies about 425 miles
east of Mexico City and 40 miles from the Gulf of Mexico.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "Flooding caused by torrential rains in recent weeks
</BLOCKQUOTE>
has killed at least 360 people and devastated wide
stretches of the central and southern parts of Mexico in
the country's worst natural disaster of the decade.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "It has also given crocodiles the right of way in
</BLOCKQUOTE>
streets that were covered in 6 to 10 feet of water during
the worst of the rains earlier this month.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "'We're getting used to (the crocodiles),' said
</BLOCKQUOTE>
Armando Zuniga, a resident of one of the wettest
neighborhoods. 'We've caught two of them in a week.' (...)
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "'We have had no reports of attacks on the
</BLOCKQUOTE>
population, but our recommendation is for people to
respect the animal and not bother it,' said Roberto
Arrechea, a representative of the Environment Ministry in
Villahermosa."
