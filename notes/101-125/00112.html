"This Viridian imaginary product was motivated by Natalie
Jeremijenko's 'stumps' concept and our brave new
'paperless' society.  Here is the catalogue ad copy:
<P>
<BR>
<P>
"Online documents are great for searching and scanning
reference material, but reading a novel online fails to
satisfy. However, killing a tree (which  would otherwise
be detoxing our atmosphere) to print hard copy seems so
archaically 'twen-cen.'
<P>
<P>
"The modern answer is The Organic Novel.  The size and
shape of a traditional hardback book, it is handsomely
bound in the rich 'leather' of the bioenhanced leaves of
the Talipot Palm.
<P>
<P>
"Inside, however, the 'book' is its own literary
biosphere.  The text is downloaded from the web to a bio-
based ZIP card that is inserted into one of four ports in
the 'organic novel.'  Then,  the front/left half of the
book <strong>grows</strong> new pages while the book is not in use. Pages
are delivered and stored in the back/right half to be
consumed at your leisure. When you are done with the
pages, simply throw them away.  The are completely bio-
reclaimable. Pages are best read within 48 hours.
<P>
<P>
"How it works: Four small tubes contain anaerobic
algae in each of three primary colors and black.  The
algae reproduce rapidly, providing a nearly inexhaustible
source of enlightening print, swiftly and silently created
by a near-relation of the scum drained from your corner
landfill.  Individual cells of color-enhanced algae have
been engineered to bond with each other when a small
electric current is applied.  The result is a translucent
organic 'page,' a single cell thick.  The algae have
ridged cellulose walls to provide lateral stability to the
tissue-thin page.
<P>
<P>
"The biotech pages are unreadable when stacked, but as
individual pages are peeled from the stack on the right
and laid on the white reading surface on the left, their
readability rivals the best chemical printers.  Small
solar cells are woven throughout the cover and spine so
that energy can be stored from office or home lighting
when the novel is not in use.  The pages can be grown at
the rate of eight per hour, so your next 50 pages can
be generated overnight.  The cells lose their enhanced
brilliance after a few days, and the printout will rot
entirely if not read within a week."
