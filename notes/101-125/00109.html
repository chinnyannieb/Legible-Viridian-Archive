<P>
Key concepts:  wine-tasting, energy-correct consumer<BR>
products,  massive holiday spikes in alcohol consumption
<P>
Attention Conservation Notice:  Drinking even in
moderation tends to be rather bad for you, while
alcoholism is a serious illness.

(((A rare piece of fugitive Sterling fiction will soon
appear in Kim Chapple's DESIGNFAX magazine.  I enjoy
writing glittering literary short stories for mags that
push O-rings, DC motors and every known form of gasket.)))

(((Fingers stained with ink, sweat flying from his head
like an anime cartoon, the Viridian Pope-Emperor is
downright forced to  drink heavily in the  heroic struggle
to compose the earthshaking "Manifesto of January 3,
2000."  I'm  still searching for just the right solar-
powered vintage, suitable for an across-the-board Viridian
stamp of approval.  I suppose that a biomass-powered
vintage might do in a pinch.  And for Christmas,  how
about one of those cute little laboratory glassware
grappa-makers?  They burn alcohol just like a fuel
cell!)))

Subject: Re: Fetzer Wines
<P>
"You might want to try the organic wines from Fetzer under
the Bon Terra Label. They cost a bit more, usually $13-$15
per bottle.  The cabernet and the chardonnay aren't too
bad.
<P>
"Fetzer has made a commitment to going totally
organic, although their Fetzer label is not 100% organic
because they use grapes not grown in their own vineyards.
Fetzer can't produce enough grapes to make enough of the
cheap stuff.  I sometimes use the Sundial to make a wine
spritzer."
<P>
From:  BDW@compuserve.com*  (Brad Westervelt)<BR>
<P>
"Be aware that Fetzer is right across the street from the
headquarters of the 'Real Goods' company.   Real Goods, as
I'm sure all budget-strapped Green wannabes know, is a
cool catalog to peruse, but it's very top dollar.  It's
full of with-it environmental products that you can
usually find  cheaper, somewhere else.
<P>
"Aloha from the wine country of the Santa Cruz Mountains."

(((Folks, let's take it as a given that we Viridians
hanker for those expensive, top o' the line<BR>
intoxicants.)))
