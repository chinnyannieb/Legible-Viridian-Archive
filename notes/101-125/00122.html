A new Viridian Individual Project by:

Mitch Porter remarks:<BR>
"My Viridian gene-splicing art project  has run into
problems thanks to local biotech politics.  A residents'
group has been opposing the construction of a large new
bioscience facility.  The management of the lab where I've
been doing this don't want the world to think that
anything but science happens in their lab, which is why
they're not named on my webpage. I'd hoped to have the
first microbial canvases done well before the Manifesto
release, but  I'm now scouting about for another lab."

(((Viridian Note 00113, "Pervasive Computing,"
suggested:)))
<P>
"The twentieth century didn't have this kind of  device at
all.  It's unheard of. It's crying out for a  brand new
name.  In fact the whole pervasive computing  field is
calling out for a new terminology, because none
of the terms we have are working properly.  (...)
We need a  new 21st century  word."
<P>
(((In Note 00118, we were offered the words:
actor, agent, alert, artificer, awareware, butler,
coadunation, creature, delegate, diplomat, domestic,
disney, emissary, employee,  enchanted, envoy, executor,
functionary, gestalt, go-between, hive, lackey, magic,
menial, operative, overmind, pimp-computing, polite,
puppet, servant, symbiont, undermind, and wary.  But this
does not at all exhaust our ingenuity!)))
<P>
From: Dan@DanTaylor.com^* (Dan Taylor)<BR>
<P>
As regards pervasive computing. A number of years ago, the
sad reality of us all being shackled to, or perhaps more
correctly monitored by, ubiquitous computing technology
caused me to think about these issues in some depth.
<P>
I came to the conclusion that the underlying technology
could best be described by the disturbing verb: "indwell"
(the spirit within). This nebulous terminology is
consistent with the "cloud" we use to describe the
Internet's pervasiveness. I registered the domain
indwell.com on Feb. 2, 1997.
<P>
I note that "the spirit within" which is co-existing with
the traditional world is not necessarily a good or bad
thing. I warn people that "schizophrenic" or "bi-polar"
are not positive terms, but "multitasking" is.
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
From: fruitbat@netspace.org^^^^^^^^^^* (Eric deRiel)<BR>
<P>
<P>
Whatever terms get coined will need to be compressible
to two syllable abbreviations, unless the future is so
dramatically faster-paced that even two becomes one too
many.
<P>
<P>
This abbreviation will likely be based on the most
successful of the previous generation of polysyllabic
buzzwords usedby the technocratsia ("Cat-5", "modem", "hi-
fi", "amp", "TV").
<P>
<P>
Ultimately, pop slang terms will arise independently
of the tech terms ("boom box", "tube", etc).
<P>
<P>
So "coadunation" is your best bet so far.  After
making the rounds in the trade rags, it can be shortened
to "coad", like "coaxial cable" to "coax" (before it just
became "cable").  As in, "Looks like a problem with your
coad, I can get someone out there in ten minutes to have a
look at it", leaving people with half a clue marveling at
the calculated vagueness of the assertion.
<P>
<P>
Beyond that: "banded", as in "on the bandwidth", but
also implying membership in a group;
<P>
<P>
"wired", which has in its time meant "electrified",
"connected to the telephone network", and "connected to
the 'Net", and will no doubt come to mean much more than
that before it's used up;
<P>
<P>
"coded", as with bar code strips on your store's
inventory, possibly leading to the malapropism "coaded".
<P>
<BR>
From: wapel@tc.cac.edu.eg^^^* (Warren Apel)<BR>
<P>
"Lucid technology." It's got a nice ring to it, it has
connotations of intelligibility without its own
intelligence. Plus it has the double meaning of
transparency, which is exactly what this is about. You
also have the verb form, elucidate, which has that built-
in "e-" prefix that Venture Capitalists pay big money for.
<P>
Another nice word, hard to spell but neat sounding, is
"transpicuous." Coupled into the phrase "transpicuous
technology" and you have a fairly new, unused phrase
without its own connotations. It's got that alliterative
double-T, and each word starts with a plosive and ends on
a syllibant, which just sounds good.
<P>
Then with the opposite of transparent, you have "manifest
technology" which literally means apparent, obvious,
proving, etc.  Plus it makes you think of "manifest
destiny," so it's as if you are preordained to purchase
it.
<P>
And my favorite is likely to be the most obvious one:
"Viridian Technology." All the components of this
technology (talking teapots, wired trees, etc) embody the
Viridian design elements you set out from the start.  Why
not stick with the term?  It's a great word, the only
connotation it starts out with is environmental, plus we
give it new connotation through the Viridian Movement.
The downside there is dilution of the original term.

I suggest the neologism "ubik."  All the connotations of
the Philip K. Dick novel "UBIK" seem to apply to this
technology.

"How about 'connected'? Connected chairs, connected
cement, connected umbrellas. Seems to sound descriptive,
but innocuous.
<P>
<P>
But even better,  a word that is already in use:
"bot".
<P>
<P>
Existing 'bots' are semi-independent programs which
prowl the sewer mains of the Internet, dredging for links
and pretending to be users on IRC. Applied to the 'aware'
objects we're talking about, the word has that newfangled,
half-slang feeling, and it also puts the described object
in its place. A lot of the other proposed words (smart,
alert, wary) suggest too much autonomy for a simple
household appliance.  Not true of bot toasters, bot
flatware, bot socks, bot TV. Bot cars. Everyone can use
those bots, y'know. "My bots are good, and ECHELON's bots
are way, way bad."
<P>
<P>
"'Bot' could become one of those unclassifiable parts
of techno-speech. "Here, let me bot that to you." "Leave
me a bot message." "It's okay, the TV can bot that format,
too." "Let's bot the game console with the coffemaker."

How about "itty-bits?"  Or  "itty-bytes."
Or "swarm-processing."
<P>
From: boyle@wcl.american.edu* (James Boyle)<BR>
<P>
I favour "mundanes" (for fridges that call Safeway),
"transcendents" for programs that know more about Turing
and Chinese boxes than you do, and "seculars" for the
fleshy envelopes of desire and distraction, like myself.
<P>
From: findjam@dialstart.net* (James Green)<BR>
<P>
"Embedded Technology", drawn from an analogy with the
electric motor.  When first developed, motors were
obvious, too expensive to produce, too big to hide. But
now motors are taken for granted.  They're everywhere.

Although pervasive computing sounds cool, the
applications you posit for it appear to be all based on
monitoring.  It seems to me that this can be achieved much
more easily and cheaply using non-invasive devices ==
networked cameras or scanners of various types.  Just
stick one in every room (or car) you want to monitor.
<P>
<P>
This would allow the system  to answer questions like
"whose shoes are in the house" without tagging every
object on the planet. Plus, it's easier to upgrade.
Installing "Windows Pervasive" (tm) patches on my toaster
is not my idea of an improvement, but I might buy a system
that tells me my toast <strong>appears</strong> to be burning.
<P>
<P>
Of course, you have to worry about pattern
recognition, expert systems, network security, and
powering everything via solar, but that's all stuff that's
working already, to some degree.  (((bruces remarks: I can
almost believe in a pervasive tag inside a toaster.  But a
smart monitor that knows that a plastic Braun toaster and
a chrome Dualit toaster are both "toasters" is smart
enough to own the house and run for elective office.)))

They're tings.  Not "things" but "tings", short for that
tingle of electricity which runs through them.
<P>
They're an extension of our electronic/cultural sensory
system, and when you feel something at the edge of
perception, that's a tingle: the hair standing up on the
back of your neck.
<P>

How about that catchy and much admired word, "factotum."
Definition: 1. a person having many diverse activities or
responsibilities, and 2. a general servant. "Factotum"
sums it up in one word.
<P>
<BR>
From: redbird@jump.net**** (Nancy Sterling)<BR>
<P>
You want a name for electronic  things that are stupid,
but respond? How about "galvanic?" "My galvanic chair
threw Grandma across the room."  "The galvanic ribbons
styled her hair in three minutes."  "The gun was loaded
with galvanic bullets and refused to fire."
<P>
<BR>
From: garreau@well.com^^^* (Joel Garreau)<BR>
<P>
Could the problem be that we're searching the wrong
language?  All these quarreling snarling yapping yet
closely connected and even tribal entities, in toto, are
obviously a "mishpocheh"  (pronounced, roughly, mish-PE-
chah.)  The following definition is from "The Joys of
Yiddish."  MISHPOCHEH : 1.] Family, including relatives
far, near, remote and numerous.  2] Ancestors, lineage.
<P>
<BR>
From: gord@alcor.concordia.ca* (Gord Sellar)<BR>
<P>
<P>
What we need for the transitional period is a set of
TWO terms, one that looks forward and one that looks back.
It's not merely that my shoes are "endowed," you see, so
much as that <strong>your</strong> shoes are "inert." "MY GOD, man, get
yourself some REAL shoes, like these here Gershenfelders."
<P>
<P>
In the long run, the term for the NEW technology will
see  less use. On the other side of the watershed, it's
the old stuff that will have to be designated as
"different."  "Still using INERT gear? You've missed the
boat, kiddo."
