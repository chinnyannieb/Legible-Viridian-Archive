Viridian Contest Judge Lola Brine mellifluously remarks:</P>

<p>"'Spore Ink' <br>
Monty Zukowski<br>
<br>
gets my vote.<br>
<br>
"His generative <br>
generations <br>
flow <br>
and grow<br>
so smoothly, like a fluid spill,  <br>
like time lapse in summer,<br>
a winner with his conscious  <br>
technical  merit alone.<br>
<br>
"But more.<br>
<br>
"This decay, growth instead,<br>
reminding me of something inside my head<br>
 &mdash;  of critical<br>
rhetorical<br>
analysis of text:<br>
<br>
"the way it sumptuously, <br>
greedily <br>
takes a mere <br>
scan of a text<br>
and sprouts tangential assertions <br>
from every <br>
unexpecting <br>
line and angle.<br>
<br>
"And from every noun, from every cultural observation...<br>
in a self-asserting stroke of genius masturbation,<br>
it grows stems <br>
and branches <br>
and thickens them into trunks<br>
of intellectual ballet and philosophical gunk,<br>
<br>
"a dance,<br>
a sport,<br>
which departs so utterly <br>
from the text at hand<br>
strangling the life from the author's gest,<br>
making it <br>
a trellis <br>
for the critic's best,<br>
<br>
"the text becoming <br>
a brick wall in effect,<br>
a blackened host, <br>
for a parasitic, narcissistic<br>
growth of a boast.<br>
<br>
"A flagrant display of literature's helpless decay,<br>
in the mind of the reader who reads words into words<br>
into words<br>
into dogma<br>
into historical relevance<br>
and theoretical smegma,<br>
"'Death to the Author'<br>
the fractals declare.<br>
<br>
"Yes this is my choice:<br>
embrace Monty, the winner!"</p>

<h2>Loft Beer</h2>

<P><b>THE OFFICIAL PITCH:</b> "Loft Beer is a refreshing ale brewed
with both barley and wheat malt, a blend of Liberty and
Sterling hops, and then spiced with the exotic kaffir lime
leaf. Loft delivers an uplifting zest, a taut, hoppy line
and a mouthful as big as the sky."</P>

<A NAME="the_critics_speak_"> </A>
<p><b>THE CRITICS SPEAK:</b></p>

<p>Bottle features a nifty pic of hop vines and a kite, plus  
wind-power propaganda right on the label!  Nice graphic 
design!<br>
Flowery aftertaste == interesting!<br>
Hoppy lawnmower beer.
Fizzy/fruity.<br>
Dry with a perfumy finish.<br>
Doesn't get there.<br>
Tastes like too many European standards.<p></p>
I'm guessing this is one of the few American beers
best served warm.</p>

<h2>
Fat Tire Amber Ale.</h2>

<P><b>THE OFFICIAL PITCH:</b> "Like the ageless delight of pedaling
a bicycle, Fat Tire Amber Ale's appeal is in its feat of
balance: toasty malt flavors (sorta like biscuits just pulled from the oven) coasting in equilibrium with crisp hoppiness. Delicious stability  &mdash;  in the sometimes precarious world of beer flavors  &mdash;  is perhaps what prompted a consumer who wrote us to say 'this beer just makes you smile.'"</p>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<A NAME="the_critics_speak_"> </A>
<p><b>THE CRITICS SPEAK:</b></p>

<P>I drink this regularly.  It's a nice, full-bodied,
mellow amber, very nice on the palate.<br>
Good stuff.  Nice finish.  Fruity flavor.<br>
Easy drinking and light.<br>
All kick is up front, with little backup taste.<br>
Good.  A no-brainer.<br>
Adequate but somewhat dull.
A little too fizzy &mdash; sweet finish.<br>
Blah.  No there there.<br>
Pleasant, but unfortunate notes reminiscent
of photographer's hypo.<br>
Not what you expect, but pleasing in any case.</P>


<h2>
Sunshine Wheat Beer</h2>

<P><b>THE OFFICIAL PITCH:</b> "Sunshine Wheat is a great beer for
erasing thirst. Yet, it has attributes that induce more
attention than just a hot summer day's consumption.
Sunshine Wheat swirls in the mouth with ripples of
coriander and orange peel tartness which settle nicely to
a tranquil sea of apple and honey tones."</P>

<A NAME="the_critics_speak_"> </A>
<p><b>THE CRITICS SPEAK:</b></p>

<p>Nice, light, lots of flavor &mdash; not too fizzy.<br>
Smooth, fruity, no bite at all.<br>
Tart, citrusy, lots of top notes, lacks malt.<br>
Lemony. Summer beer.  Ehhh...<br>
Surprisingly fruity.  Interesting for a wheat beer.<br>
Light, citrusy, floral, but watery.<br>
Fruity, with a lackluster finish.<br>
Blah.</p>

<h2>
Blue Paddle Pilsener Lager.</h2>

<P><b>THE OFFICIAL PITCH:</b> "Blue Paddle Pilsener, crafted with
malt-only brewing and noble hops, explores the boundaries
where American lagers seldom journey. Reflective of
Europe's finest Pilseners, Blue Paddle delivers a
refreshing bitterness, vibrant finish and a subtle but
intricate depth of flavor. Unlike the old world examples,
this landlocked Pilsener is only shipped within our small
Western territory."</P>

<A NAME="the_critics_speak_"> </A>
<p><b>THE CRITICS SPEAK:</b></p>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>Light, foamy  &mdash;  no finish.<BR>
Too much tang.<BR>
Paddle back to the dock.<BR>
A very mellow light beer with a bit too much hops.<BR>
Undistinguished, neither pilsener nor lager  &mdash;  like Schlitz.<br>
Needs a bar code.<br>
Another over-hopped brew.<br>
Light and easy.<br>
Dry, almost a sour taste.<br>
Too sour!  Like fruit juice that's gone off.</P>

<h2>
1554 Brussels Style Black Ale</h2>

<P><b>THE OFFICIAL PITCH:</b> "Other than being dark in color, 1554
has little in common with porter or stouts. The beer is
fermented at relatively high temperatures using a European
lager yeast that imparts a refreshing, zesty acidity. With
1554 our staff hoped to create an ale that would be easy
to imagine as a beer served 446 years ago, but also a beer
that doesn't ignore 446 years of brewing advancements."</P>

<A NAME="the_critics_speak_"> </A>
<p><b>THE CRITICS SPEAK:</b></p>

<P>Nice bold flavor, very close to a porter.<br>
Roasty.  A little bitter on the finish.<BR>
Smoky  &mdash;  but like a good cigar.<BR>
Tough finish: industrial strength.<BR>
Dark and mysterious, best of the bunch.<BR>
I like anything with the word "Brussels" in it.<BR>
Hearty... yet light, smooth.<br>
Meaty, yet amusing.<br>
Rich.  Very nice.  Not so malty as to be cloying.  Yum.<br>
Rich, tingly.  A good blend.<br>
Thick and intriguing.<br>
Smooth... but with an abrupt finish.</P>
