<P>"MACRO-ENGINEERING OPTIONS FOR CLIMATE CHANGE MANAGEMENT &amp;  MITIGATION</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Isaac Newton Institute, Cambridge, England, 7-9 January 2004</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><b>((("Nature and Nature's laws lay hid in night: / God said, 'Let
Newton be,'" and Newton was immediately discredited by Lysenkoist
Beltway political operatives bankrolled by the fossil-fuel industry.)))</b></P>

<P>"Background</P>

<P>"Reducing global greenhouse gas emissions by the amount (say 50%) which may be  
necessary to avoid excessive climate change, will be very difficult.  If combined with  
significant convergence internationally, it will moreover require the developed countries  
to reduce their emissions by much larger proportions, such as 90% (for the USA) and 80%  
(for Europe).  Many people feel that it is very unlikely that such reductions can be  
achieved just by improving energy efficiency and reducing carbon intensity by using  
renewable sources of energy.  <b>(((Yep, it sounds pretty tough... I guess we'd better just 
fold our hands and die from this civilizational inadequacy of ours... Oh wait, maybe we 
techies can invent some source of hope, however farfetched!)))</b>
</P>

<P>"Specifically, conventional approaches may not be sufficient  regarding either their 
magnitude and their time-scale.  Because of the urgency of  implementing climate-change 
management, more innovative approaches to the mitigation  of climate change are likely to 
be needed.</P>

<P><b>(((Let's rephrase this, shall we?  "Although we can't find the political will not to 
cook our own planet, we might, while cooking, be able to invent some weird way to avert 
some of the consequences.")))</b></P>

<P>"Indeed, new options may already be needed  during the Second Commitment Period for the 
Kyoto Protocol.  Any alternatives such as  possible macro-engineering options for climate 
change management and mitigation  therefore need to be widely discussed and properly 
evaluated, as soon as possible, before  they can be seriously considered for 
implementation.</P>


  <P><b>(((The peculiar assumption here is that people will find the resources, cash and 
  energy to repair a climate crisis while they are actually on fire.  It's kind of like 
  arguing a legal case after being flung in prison.  But, well, okay &ndash; if that's what it 
  takes, carry on!)))</b></P>

<P>"The Tyndall Centre for Climate  Change Research and the Cambridge-MIT Institute are 
therefore jointly convening a  Symposium in Cambridge, England, on 7-9 January 2004, whose 
purpose is to identify, debate, and evaluate possible macro-engineering approaches  to the 
management and mitigation of climate change.</P>

<P>"Specific Symposium Objectives</P>

<P>"1.  to convene and consolidate the relevant research community  <b>(((Hey, research guys! 
 Too bad you didn't have the clout to convince oil and coal companies not to destroy our 
civilization!)))</b></P>


<P>"2.  to provide a panoramic review of the options <b>(((Step One: jail entire board of 
Exxon-Mobil for crimes against humanity, Step Two, shut Chinese coal mines by force of 
arms... whoops, these vital steps don't seem to be in here!)))</b></P>

  <P>"3.  to evaluate the options using multi-criterion analysis and ranking techniques 
  <b>((("Grandmere has died in her Paris apartment of the heat; quick, order a multi-criterion 
  analysis, and rank her.)))</b></P>

  <P>"4.  to contribute to setting the research &amp; development agenda  <b>(((we're from 
  Cambridge and MIT, so we don't do that "action" stuff.)))</b></P>

  <P>"5.  to provide the scientific, engineering and socio-economic basis for policy 
  formation by  Governments.  <b>(((Oh Vannevar Bush, that we have lived to see this melancholy 
  day for the Endless Frontier mavens of your beloved MIT...  At last everyone on Earth can 
  become Robert "Destroyer of Worlds" Oppenheimer  through the simple process of pumping 
  some gasoline.)))</b></P>

  <P>"Page 2  Philosophy</P>


<P>"The intention is to initiate a process of exploration and evaluation of any possible 
macroengineering approaches, so that suitable options may be available if and when it is 
decided  that they are required.  <b>(((Decided by whom?)))</b>  This process is envisaged as 
continuing for a number of years,  before any firm conclusions can be reached.  The range 
of approaches identified now will  doubtless be incomplete, and any evaluations made will 
necessarily be preliminary.</P>

<P>"Nevertheless, since the detailed evaluation and the actual implementation of any  
promising approaches may take several decades, it is important to start the process as  
soon as possible.  <b>(((Good thinking.  We'll need to give Rem Koolhaas plenty of 
contractual leeway so that he
can construct a vast new prison in The Hague.)))</b></P>

<P>"Although most of the macro-engineering approaches identified so far are not currently 
in  the  mainstream thinking in relation to climate policy, <b>(((wry MIT-Cambridge 
ivory-basement humor here)))</b> the mere fact that they have been  conceived and proposed 
places an obligation on engineers, economists, and environmental  and social scientists, 
working together, to explore their feasibility and evaluate their  consequences and their 
wider implications.  <b>(((We're screwed and we all know it.  So, hey, let's blue-sky and 
handwave!)))</b>
</P>

<P>"At the very least, such options may be  considered as emergency policy options in the 
event of more adverse climate change  impacts than expected, or less effective carbon 
reduction measures than anticipated.  The  process of  exploration, evaluation, 
development and (eventually) pre-operational  implementation of such approaches should be 
regarded as at least an insurance against  these eventualities.   <b>(((If "thinking the 
unthinkable" was good enough for Herman Kahn, it's good enough for us!)))</b></P>

<P>"The symposium will therefore</P>

 <ul><li>"Consider all approaches identified, objectively, and without preconceptions  
  <b>(((For instance, we'll consider and identify some objective provisions for really, really 
  massive graveyards)))</b></li>

 <li>"Engage in an open, unbiassed, and visionary but still concrete discussion   <b>(((I'm 
  starting to warm to this kooky Tyndall project, even though I know full well that it means 
  every possible kind of hell for my grandchildren)))</b></li>

  <li>"Disregard potential pressures in relation to political correctness. <b>(((Hoo-ah)))</b></li>

<li>"* Employ a very wide range of criteria for a preliminary evaluation</li></ul>


<P><b>(((Maybe SAUCER-MEN will save us from our own insanity!  Or &ndash; okay, maybe I'm 
blue-skying it here, but bear with me &ndash; maybe mass prayer can trigger a premature 
Rapture!)))</b></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"Possible options to be considered</P>

  <P>1.  CO2 Sequestration (capture and storage), including</P>

  <UL>
    <LI>Geological disposal (liquid &amp; solid)  <b>(((export our crisis to the 
    great-grandkids)))</b></LI>

    <LI>Direct ocean disposal  <b>(((dissolve coral reefs in seltzer water)))</b></LI>

    <LI>Atmospheric scrubbing  <b>(((needs really, really, really big sponge)))</b></LI>

    <LI>Ocean fertilisation  <b>(((sounds good as all fish are doomed anyway)))</b></LI>

    <LI>Enhancement of land carbon sinks  <b>(((grow more trees? OK!)))</b></LI>

  </UL>
  <P>Page 3</P>

  <P>"2. Insolation Management (albedo modification)</P>

  <P>"Orbiting Deflection Systems (Mirrors, Balloons, Droplets, etc.)  <b>(((I'm really 
  liking the "balloons", though "droplets" are kinda growing on me as I begin to sweat 
  bullets)))</b>
  </P>

  <UL>
    <LI>Stratospheric Aerosols  <b>(((Manmade Global Dimming)))</b>
    <BR><BR></LI>

    <LI>Differential Cloud Stimulation  <b>(((Poor people's countries don't get any clouds 
    any more)))</b>
    <BR><BR></LI>

    <LI>Land Surface Modification  <b>(((paint roofs and roads white)))</b></LI>

  </UL>
  <P>"3. Prospective Climate Design  <b>(((I do hope they teach this at Cranbrook)))</b></P>

  <ul><li>"Terra-forming Approaches</li>

  <li>"Glaciation Control by Designer Greenhouse Gases  <b>(((Huh?)))</b></li>

  <li>"Long-Term CO2 Management for Photosynthesis   <b>(((When the biosphere does this 
  naturally, it's known as a "coal-bed")))</b></li></ul>

  <P>"4. Impacts Reduction</P>

  <P>"Ocean-Current Stabilization by River Deviation  <b>(((Re-route the Mississippi through 
  Washington DC to keep Europe from freezing)))</b></P>

  <P>"Sea-Level Stabilization by Freshwater Retention  <b>(((dam up the molten Antarctic 
  glaciers)))</b></P>

  <P>"Large-Scale Migration Corridors for Biosphere Adaptation <b>(((abandon the American 
  MidWest, reinstate nomads and bison)))</b></P>

  <P>"Note:  many of these possible options are highly speculative at present, and some 
  may  even appear to be crazy.  <b>(((Okay, I love these guys. All is forgiven.  Send me the 
  conference T-shirt.)))</b></P>

  <P>"However, that is precisely why they should be evaluated (and if  necessary 
  dismissed) as soon as possible.  Otherwise, politicians may seek to use them as 'Magic 
  Bullets' either to postpone action, or as prospective solutions for actual  implementation,
   once it becomes clear that the mitigation of climate change is going to be  a major and 
  very difficult task.  <b>((("Major and very difficult" = "bankrupting and massively 
  lethal")))</b></P>

  <P>"Evaluation Criteria</P>

  <P>"The criteria to be considered for evaluating options should include:        
  Feasibility  <STRONG> Effectiveness  </STRONG>  Predictability  <STRONG>  Reversibility  
  </STRONG> Environmental impacts  <STRONG>  Ecological tolerability  </STRONG> Safety 
  (potential for disaster)  <STRONG> Cost  </STRONG>  Social equity <STRONG>  Economic 
  equity  </STRONG> Economic efficiency  *  Public attitude  <b>(((Nice list there, would look 
  great on the T-shirt)))</b>
  </P>

  <P>"Evaluation Methodology</P>

  <P>"We propose to use a combination of techniques to guide and motivate the debate.  
  These  will include the iterative Delphi method (where those holding extreme views are 
  invited  to explain their reasons, prior to a collective re-evaluation).  We also propose 
  to use multicriterion decision analysis and scale-free ranking techniques.  These will be 
  used at the  symposium simply to facilitate and focus the debate, and we shall not attempt 
  to reach  anything more than preliminary and indicative conclusions.</P>

  <P><b>(((The good ol' Delphi method, wow.)))</b></P>

  <P>"Organisation and Process</P>

  <P>"A modified Dahlem Conference approach is proposed.  Before the symposium, the  
  Tyndall Centre &amp; CMI will therefore commission and distribute a set of short factual  
  briefing notes on the alternative approaches to be discussed, with selected references to  
  sources of further information.     The symposium will commence with invited plenary 
  presentations reviewing the options  under consideration, each followed by a Q&amp;A 
  sessions to enable participants to clarify any  matters of interest or doubt.  This will 
  be followed by further group presentations and  debate based on the working papers.  The 
  first day will concentrate on factual issues, and  on mutual education, and will 
  deliberately avoid premature attempts to reach conclusions.   It will conclude with a 
  preparatory explanation of the evaluation process, and the criteria  to be considered, and 
  a final plenary discussion session in which any other major issues or  concerns can be 
  raised.    The second day will be commenced in parallel sessions (with chairs and rapporteurs), with  each group carrying 
out the same task, i.e. to debate the pros &amp; cons of each option  according to the 
criteria selected, without deliberately seeking a consensus, and then  (working as 
individuals) evaluate them on a qualitative scale (e.g. H/M/L,  good/neutral/bad, etc) 
against each criterion.  Following this the facilitators will prepare a  synthesis of 
these evaluations [see Note 2].    During the final afternoon the rapporteurs will 
summarise the major issues and outcomes  arising from their sessions, and the facilitators 
will then present their synthesis of the  evaluation (including the ranges and outlying 
opinions).  The symposium will conclude  with a final discussion to permit expressions of 
assent and dissent.  There will be no  attempt to force any agreement on consensus 
conclusions at this meeting, although these  would be reported if they should emerge 
naturally.</P>

<P><b>(((You know, the human race may well be pitching itself and a million other species off 
a cliff, and organizational minutiae like this paragraph up above, that is the crown of 
our civilization.)))</b></P>

<P>"Outcomes &amp; Deliverables</P>

  <P>"The principal Symposium output will be a short (circa 10-page) synthesis/strategic  
  overview document based on the working papers and the discussions, summarising the  
  salient attributes of each scheme, and recording the symposium evaluation of each, (i.e.  
  their preliminary overall ranking, including ranges, and annotated with any special issues 
   identified).  Further symposium materials (presentations, working papers, bibliography,  
  etc) will be placed on the Tyndall web-site.  <b>(((I really can't wait!)))</b></P>

<P>"The deliverables envisaged are therefore:</P>

<ul><li>"A new volume in the Tyndall Symposia Series of topical monographs  <b>(((There are 
almost 2,000 people on Viridian List now, so if we were to each order one of these Tyndall 
Symposia climate monographs, I feel quite certain that we would vastly outnumber all other 
such consumers)))</b></li>

<li>"An executive summary technical paper for (e.g.) Nature or Science <b>(((vastly to 
  their credit, neither Nature or Science have bowed the knee to political pressure as 
  yet)))</b></li>

<li>"A briefing/overview paper for government and policy-makers  <b>(((Useless without a 
  fat packet stuffed with re-election money, but you can't say they didn't try.)))</b></li>

<li>"Web-based dissemination of results, possibly including an e-mail conference.</li></ul>

  <P>"Participants</P>

  <P>"Following the Dahlem format there will be between 40 and 50 invited participants, 
  mainly  from a professional (science, engineering, and socio-economic) background, 
  together with  additional participants from the policy and business communities and major 
  NGO's to  ensure that the full range of attitudes will be expressed.  <b>((("Full range of 
  attitudes?"  What?  No ludicrously opinionated science fiction writers?  Call Michael 
  Crichton!)))</b>
  </P>

  <P>"Notes</P>

  <P>"1)  The workshop process proposed is a loose hybrid of the classic Dahlem model, and 
  the  first iterations of a Delphi process.  The aim is to elicit and report the full range 
  of  views, and not to arrive at a consensus.</P>

  <P>"2)  The evaluation process should employ a non-parametric multiple criterion 
  approach,  and the distributions of the scores should be preserved and presented.  The 
  proposed  attempt to arrive at a preliminary overall ranking and synthesis may be too 
  ambitious  (but is suggested since it will help to focus and stimulate the final 
  discussion)."</P>
