<P>Link:  Wow, look everybody!  I've done a cool piece of
electronic interactive multimedia web-accessible techno-
literate digital net.art! After all these years of hanging
out on nettime list, I'm finally right in the game!
Look out Ars Electronica!</P>

<P>By the way, you need Flash 6 and broadband for this thing,
or,  if you're on 56K dialup, get yourself a magazine to
leaf through, or something.</P>

<p>
1.  A Viridian friend of a friend sent this portrait of
Isobel while she was still at sea.
<br><img src="../../isobel/Hurricane-Isobel.jpg">http://www.viridiandesign.org/isobel/Hurricane-Isobel.jpg</A></P>


<P>2.  But I went to Washington DC anyway.  Looks like
Washington is still Washington, hurricane or no.<br><br>
<img src="../../isobel/novusordo.jpg">http://www.viridiandesign.org/isobel/novusordo.jpg</A></P>

<P>3.  My event was cancelled because of the storm.
So I went over to the "Competitive Enterprise Institute,"
the globally notorious Greenhouse-denial tools of Exxon-
Mobil. Surprise, the hurricane had  closed them too!
<br><img src="../../isobel/CEIcloses.jpg">http://www.viridiandesign.org/isobel/CEIcloses.jpg</A>
<br><a href="http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1046363,00.html">http://observer.guardian.co.uk/international/story/0,6903,1046363,00.html</A></P>

<P>4.  CATO Institute also denies the Greenhouse.  They were
in tree-crashing distance from my hotel.
<br><a href="http://www.cato.org/people/michaels.html">http://www.cato.org/people/michaels.html</A>
<br><a href="http://www.cato.org/dailys/06-15-01.html">http://www.cato.org/dailys/06-15-01.html</A>
<br><img src="../../isobel/cato%20tree.jpg">http://www.viridiandesign.org/isobel/cato%20tree.jpg</A></P>

<P>5.  Kind of a tough commute to the CATO office there,
what with that big dead tree right on their street.
<br><img src="../../isobel/catotree2.jpg">http://www.viridiandesign.org/isobel/catotree2.jpg</A></P>

<P>6. As soon as I took this pic of that wind-flung
windowframe right on CATO's doorstep, that CATO janitor
rushed out and picked it up and carried it inside.
<br><img src="../../isobel/catodebris.jpg">http://www.viridiandesign.org/isobel/catodebris.jpg</A></P>

<P>7.  The local arts community had to put their statuary
in bondage, lest the winds carry them  off a la Dorothy
in Oz.  Whoops, that pic is sideways.  Oh well, those
ropes will hold her down.
<br><img src="../../isobel/bondagestatue1.jpg">http://www.viridiandesign.org/isobel/bondagestatue1.jpg</A></P>

<P>8.  Kind of an ironic feminist statement here; maybe she
was boldly applying for equal pay for equal work, or maybe
this bulky gal is one o'them "Schwarzenegger Feminists."
<br><img src="../../isobel/statuebonds.jpg">http://www.viridiandesign.org/isobel/statuebonds.jpg</A></P>


<P>9.  The bondage ropes may leave, but those big concrete
truckbomb barriers are the signature architectural motif
of War-On-Terror Washington.
<br><img src="../../isobel/truckbombbonds.jpg">http://www.viridiandesign.org/isobel/truckbombbonds.jpg</A></P>

<P>10.  Live at the Washington Monument.  One has to wonder
why they didn't reverently take in all those flags.
<br><img src="../../isobel/landscapeflags.jpg">http://www.viridiandesign.org/isobel/landscapeflags.jpg</A></P>

<P>11.  After all, that's George Washington's monument.
<br><img src="../../isobel/stormflags1.jpg">http://www.viridiandesign.org/isobel/stormflags1.jpg</A></P>

<P>12.  When Washington finally won the Revolutionary War,
the British band played "The World Turned Upside Down."
<br><img src="../../isobel/stormflags2.jpg">http://www.viridiandesign.org/isobel/stormflags2.jpg</A></P>

<P>13.  Who's minding the store?
<br><img src="../../isobel/blowntoshreds.jpg">http://www.viridiandesign.org/isobel/blowntoshreds.jpg</A></P>

<P>14.  Before I got into design, I probably wouldn't
have noticed this strange lantern on the side of the
Commerce Department that features <STRONG>bats and opium
poppies.</STRONG> Maybe it's a gift from the Afghani Commerce
Department!
<br><img src="../../isobel/batspoppies.jpg">http://www.viridiandesign.org/isobel/batspoppies.jpg</A></P>

<P>14.  Nice Commerce motto here... though, if you're working
in fossil-fuel commerce, you're <STRONG>creating</STRONG> the winds and
tempests as you "invade every zone."
<br><img src="../../isobel/commercewind.jpg">http://www.viridiandesign.org/isobel/commercewind.jpg</A></P>

<P>15.  The locals didn't look too pleased about the
drenching sheets of rain.
<br><img src="../../isobel/drenchedlocal.jpg">http://www.viridiandesign.org/isobel/drenchedlocal.jpg</A></P>

<P>16. Washington lost about 300 trees to Isobel.  Of course
that's nothing much compared to the fate of Annapolis.
<br><img src="../../isobel/monument.jpg">http://www.viridiandesign.org/isobel/monument.jpg</A></P>

<P>17.  Here I am making the scene at the White House during
a  hurricane.  I probably shouldn't be enjoying myself
quite that much, but, well, it was only a measly Category
2.  Wait'll next time.
<br><img src="../../isobel/whitehousepope.jpg">http://www.viridiandesign.org/isobel/whitehousepope.jpg</A></P>

<P>18.  Front yard of the White House the morning after
Isobel. Hey, great job with the forest preservation policy
there!
<br><img src="../../isobel/whdebris.jpg">http://www.viridiandesign.org/isobel/whdebris.jpg</A></P>

<P>19.  The White House handily comes equipped with its own
chain saws!
<br><img src="../../isobel/whchainsaw.jpg">http://www.viridiandesign.org/isobel/whchainsaw.jpg</A></P>

<P>20.  Meanwhile, back in dizzy old San Francisco, where
Democrats cling to power by tooth and nail....<br>
<br><img src="../../isobel/solarcisco.jpg">http://www.viridiandesign.org/isobel/solarcisco.jpg</A></P>

<div align="center"><h3>O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O O=c=O<br>
YES, IT'S ELECTION SEASON...<br>
NOT LIKE WE GET TO ELECT<br>
A NEW ATMOSPHERE, THOUGH<br>
