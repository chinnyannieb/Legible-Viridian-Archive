<dt>Attention Conservation Notice:</dt>  <dd>Nothing new about
environmental activists hand-wringing over prospects of
mass starvation.  Kinda new to wonder if this might go
from the unthinkable to a real-life truism in such
short order, though.</dd>

<P>Mind-boggling real-life NASA animation of planet frying
during the 20th century's last quarter-century.  Man, no
wonder they're dying in France.

<P>Malignant  hucksters at "Greening Earth Society" blame
French mass deaths on foolish lack of (coal-powered?) air
conditioners. Maybe they can air-condition the wheat
crops, too!

<P>Meanwhile, hundreds of the (10,000+) French dead remain
unclaimed and unburied.

<P>George Monbiot not too thrilled at latest WTO in Mexico,
predicts French Revolution as planet's starving wretches
hang US-Euro aristocrats from the global lanterne.

<h2>"Hot summer sparks global food crisis</h2>

<P><b>By Geoffrey Lean, Environment Editor</b></P>

<P>"31 August 2003</P>

<P>"This summer's heatwave has drastically cut harvests
across Europe, plunging the world into an unprecedented
food crisis, startling new official figures show.
<b>(((Yep, that sure looks pretty "startling."  I didn't
believe it.  Then I started looking into the subject.  I
still don't believe it,  but I'm not a happy guy.)))</b></P>

<P>"Separate calculations by two leading institutions
monitoring the global harvest show that the scorching
weather has severely reduced European grain production,
ensuring that the world will not produce enough to feed
itself for the fourth year in succession, and plunging
stocks to the lowest level on record. And experts predict
that the damage to crops will be found to be even greater
when the full cost of the heat is known.</P>

<P><b>(((What about next year?  I mean, look at this NASA
satellite thing again.  Really.)))</b>
<A HREF="http://www.giss.nasa.gov/data/update/gistemp/animations/">http://www.giss.nasa.gov/data/update/gistemp/animations/</a><br></P>

<P>"They say that, as a result, food prices will rise
worldwide, and hunger will increase in the world's poorest
countries. And they warn that this is just a foretaste of
what will happen as global warming takes hold.
<b>(((I hope you can <STRONG>afford</STRONG> a "foretaste." Will we ever
get an "aftertaste" of this in our lifetimes?)))</b></P>

<P>"Sunshine and warmth are, of course, good for plants and
there were hopes that this year's good summer would
produce a bumper harvest. But excessive heat and low
rainfall damage crops, and the heatwave == which brought
temperatures of more than 100F to Britain for the first
time, and gave France 11 consecutive days above 95F,
killing more than 1,000 people == has done enormous
damage.
<b>(((Odd that people in power seem so completely unaware of
this.  Why are they stumbling through such a blatant
threat to world well-being in such a blindsided way?
It's as if they were governing some different planet
where people don't sweat or eat.)))</b></P>

<P>"The US Department of Agriculture has cut its forecast for
this year's grain harvest by 32 million tons, mainly
because of the European crop reductions. On Thursday, the
International Grains Council == an intergovernmental body
== reduced its own prediction even further, by 36 million
tons, as a result of 'heat and drought, particularly in
Europe.'</P>

<P><b>(((Yes, they exist, no, they are not cranks.)))</b>

<A HREF="http://www.igc.org.uk/">http://www.igc.org.uk/</a><br>
<b>(((On the plus side, the IGC don't seem to be screaming
bloody murder yet. Perhaps they're quite used to seeing
people starve.)))</b></P>

<P>"The damage has been most severe in Eastern Europe, which
is now bringing in its worst wheat crop in three decades:
in Ukraine, the harvest has been cut from 21 million tons
last year to five million, while Romania has its worst
crop on record. Germany is the worst-hit EU country: some
farmers in the south-east have lost half their grain
harvest. Official British figures will not be published
until October. <b>(((If you can trust British government
figures, that is.  Maybe they'll hide 'em under those
old BSE reports.)))</b></P>

<P>"The final tally of the summer's damage is likely to be
worse still. Lester Brown, the president of Washington's
authoritative Earth Policy Institute, predicts that it
will cut another 20 million tons off the world harvest,
making this a catastrophic year.
<b>(((You know, back in Stalin's day, you could starve 7
million people or so, and the world press would just
ignore that completely! Because they were too busy with
war scares, imaginary weapons, depressions, political
campaigning and such.)))</b>
<A HREF="http://www.ukrweekly.com/Archive/1998/319815.shtml">http://www.ukrweekly.com/Archive/1998/319815.shtml</a><br></P>

<P>"It has come at a time when world food supplies were
already at their most precarious ever. The world has eaten
more grain than it has produced every year so far this
century, driving stocks well below the safety margin to
their lowest levels in the 40 years that records have been
kept. The amount of grain produced for each person on
earth is now less than at any time in more than three
decades.
<b>((("Let them eat brioche.")))</b></P>

<P>"Until about a month ago, this year had been expected to
produce a reasonable harvest, allowing some recovery. But
the heatwave has now ensured that it will make things even
worse, and experts say that the crisis will deepen as
global warming increases.  <b>(((They always say that ==
but they rarely said it would be <STRONG>this fast.</STRONG>  Alps are
melting, people are dying in hecatombs and crops are
failing.  The Viridian Movement is supposed to have an
expiration date of 2012.  Will we make it that far?)))</b></P>

<P>"Grain prices have already increased, and Mr Brown warns
that in coming years they may move to a permanently higher
level. This would encourage greater production, he says,
but at the expense of the world's hungry, who could then
afford even less food, and of the environment, as farming
intensified."</P>
