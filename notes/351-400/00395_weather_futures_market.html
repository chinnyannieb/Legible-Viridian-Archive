<h1>Viridian Note 00395: Weather Futures Market</h1>

<DL><dt>Key concepts:</dt>  <dd>futures markets, weather turbulence, 
  weather-dependent industries</dd>
  
<dt>Attention Conservation Notice:</dt> <dd>Concerns peculiar vagaries
of contemporary capitalism; includes some mind-deadening
biz-jargon.</dd></DL>

<hr>

<P>Alas for those halcyon days when the market solutions of
the "Washington Consensus" commanded some respect. Today's
buffaloed WTO falls down as if pepper-gassed in the<BR>
streets. The executive briefing? "The poor die and the
planet cooks."<BR>

<P>The miracle year for weather markets is 2065 AD,<BR>
the predicted year in which weather damage outpaces the
planet's entire GNP.  That's just a rough estimate, mind
you. Could be later.  Could be sooner.<BR>

<P>Do you suppose there is some kind of risk-hedging market
solution for "megacryometeors'?  No one even knows<BR>
what those darn things are.<BR>

  <P>"Change in the Weather == Bet on It"<BR>
  by Richard Valdmanis</P>

  <P>USA: December 16, 2003</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>"NEW YORK - Buying and selling the weather may seem an
even stranger way to pass the time than trading orange
juice or pork bellies."</P>

<P><b>(((How exotic is this supposed to be compared to  DARPA
terrorism markets?)))</b><BR>
Link:<BR>

<P>"But in a year when an uncertain winter outlook threatens profits in weather-dependent industries like oil
and power, a rapidly growing number of players are using
weather markets to hedge their risks and anticipate Mother
Nature's whims.</P>

<P><b>(((If only those <STRONG>were</STRONG> "Mother Nature's whims" instead of
the whims of "industries like oil and power.")))</b></P>

<P>"Trading volumes on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange<BR>
weather futures market, the first of its kind when it came
into being in 1999, have more than quadrupled since last
year at roughly $1.6 billion in trades, with watchers on
the sidelines coming to view the market as a<BR>
meteorological crystal ball.</P>

<P><b>((("The sky above the Chicago futures market was the color
of television.")))</b></P>

<P>"'This market is an excellent way for players to hedge
their weather risk, because it completely isolates the
weather as a factor,' said Felix Carabello, associate
director of industrial commodities and head of weather
futures at the CME.</P>

<P><b>(((Yeah, but what if there's another Chicago Heat Wave and
all the weather traders die?)))</b><BR>

<br><a href="http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/443213in.html">http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/443213in.html</A></P>

<P>"'But the market also represents the aggregate viewpoint of all its participants and is therefore a good
indicator of what people believe the weather will do,' he
added.</P>

<P><b>(((What people think isn't necessarily what weather will
actually do, which raises the interesting notion of a
massive panic in a weather market.)))</b></P>

<P>"Weather impacts about a third of the nation's gross domestic profit, or $3 trillion of the U.S. economy,
according to Rodney Weiher, chief economist for the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.</P>

<P><b>(((Can anyone (besides a government economist) imagine
that two thirds of the U.S. economy is <STRONG>immune</STRONG> to<BR>
weather?)))</b></P>

<P>"The weather futures market allows companies to hedge
their risk by giving them a alternate source of revenue
when weather hurts their core business. A heating oil
supplier, for example, can bet on warm weather in New York
or Boston, thus countering a loss in demand if the warmth
occurs.</P>

<P><b>(((Or, just bet on crazy Greenhouse weather violence
happening someplace or other, and you ought to<BR>
be able to sew up ten percent rates of return, year<BR>
after year!)))</b></P>

<P>"Energy companies often have access to in-house or private
weather forecasters, and a futures market gives them
incentive to act on, and thereby reveal, such information
in weather futures pricing.   <b>(((It also gives energy
companies incentive to lie about the havoc they themselves
are wreaking on the weather and then profit by their own
misbehavior.  Of course, people said that about the DARPA
"terrorism market," too.)))</b></P>

<P>"A market that can serve the dual function of leveling out
risk and providing increased transparency into an<BR>
industry's weather expertise is a much-welcomed boon in a
year that promises finicky weather patterns and<BR>
volatility.</P>

<P><b>(((Increased transparency could be nice.  Viridian<BR>
principle:  "Make the Invisible Visible".  If, instead of
poor Third Worlders dying from weather violence, rich
speculators were also going broke in droves, this might
compel useful action of some kind.)))</b></P>

<P>"The U.S. National Weather Service, along with several private U.S. forecasters, said this winter's weather will
be particularly hard to predict due to a lack of a strong El Nino or La Nina weather driver in the Pacific.<BR>
<b>(((Yep, it could get lively!)))</b></P>

<P>"This lack of a clear weather outlook generally makes it more difficult for energy suppliers to anticipate the
nation's demand for products like heating oil, natural
gas, and electricity. 'In a year like this you're bound to
see interest in this market jump,' said Agbeli Ameko,
managing partner for Denver-based Enercast, which provides
financial information to the natural gas industry.</P>

<br><a href="http://www.enercast.com/">http://www.enercast.com/</A><BR>
<b>(((Interesting site here.  Too bad one has to sign up in
order to use it)))</b></P>

<P>"The CME weather futures market, which logged over 18,000
contracts this year through November compared to 4,446 in
the same period last year, did a good job of reflecting
forecasts of abnormally warm weather in November, followed
by a cold trend in December, Ameko said.</P>

<P>"'The market knew about the cooling trend in November well
in advance of a rise in natural gas prices,' Ameko said.</P>

<P><b>(((What if the market privately learns about something
really, really awful?  Like, say, a sudden reversal in the
Earth's magnetic field?  How does one cash in on knowledge
like that, eh?  Really thought-provoking!)))</b></P>


<P>"While the CME would not name any of the companies that
actively trade in weather futures, <b>(((why is this a big
secret?)))</b> Carabello said they included a broad cross-
section of energy companies, reinsurance companies, and
even some hedge funds that see an opportunity in weather's
volatility.</P>

<P>"'The first wave is always the pioneers,' said< Carabello. 'As people start to become more savvy about
their economic relationship with the weather, they are
more likely to turn that risk into weather transactions.'"</P>
