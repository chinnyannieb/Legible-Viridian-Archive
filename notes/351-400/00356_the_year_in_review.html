<h2>GBN Global Perspectives</h2>
<h3>by Gwynne Dyer</h3>

<P>"2002: Year-End Review</P>

<P>"The past year has been dominated by a US obsession
with Iraq which, remarkably, only seized the Bush
administration three long months after the terrorist
attacks on the United States in September, 2001.
</P>

<P>"In my year-end survey twelve months ago, just after
the US occupation of Afghanistan, I simply wrote that
Middle Eastern Muslims were waiting to learn 'which of
their countries the United States would hit next:  Iraq,
Somalia or Sudan.' Washington was clearly looking for a
fresh target, but nobody had a clue which way it was going
to jump.
</P>

<P>"In that sense, the most important event of 2002 was
President George W. Bush's speech in late January in which
he announced that he had uncovered an 'axis of evil', and
gave Iraq first place.  The subsequent months have been
filled with endless speculation about when and how the US
would attack Iraq, whether it would go to the United
Nations first (it did, in September), and whether it would
give the UN arms inspectors time to do their job (which
remains to be seen) &ndash; but it all distracted the US
public's attention through a year of recession and
corporate scandals, and gave control of the Senate back to
the Republican Party in the November
Congressional elections.
</P>

<P>"Whatever the original motives for the choice of Iraq,
the project now has an almost unstoppable momentum within
the introverted world of Washington politics, and the Bush
administration almost certainly will attack Iraq, probably
in the next few months.  But the weird thing about 2002 is
that the international news has been virtually monopolised
by a non-event.  There has been no fighting in the Middle
East apart from the familiar cycle of violence between
Israelis and Palestinians, and no regimes have toppled.
Indeed, nothing tangible has yet changed in the region,
apart from a gradual increase in the usual pace of US and
British bombing in Iraq's 'no-fly zones'.
</P>

<P>"The terrorists haven't been very busy either, or at
least not the ones who are the primary concern of the US
'war on terror'.  As usual, terrorists killed thousands of
people in places like Colombia and Nepal, in guerilla wars
that barely make it into the mainstream media.  Many
hundreds died in terrorist attacks in Israel and Russia,
countries fighting wars against Muslim subject peoples
that have managed to hitch their local struggles to
Washington's global crusade.  But barely two hundred
Westerners were killed by terrorists in 2002, most of them
in one attack in Bali  &ndash; and hardly any of them were
Americans.  Things may change dramatically once the US
attack on Iraq gets underway, but in 2002 the allegedly
'titanic struggle between good and evil' (in Mr Bush's
words) has been a phony war for both sides.
</P>

<P>"Almost unnoticed amidst all the media hype about
coming events, there was dramatic progress in closing down
the real wars that have been ravaging whole regions and
killing huge numbers of people.  First came the 27-year-
old Angolan civil war, which suddenly ended in April after
the rebel leader Jonas Savimbi was caught in an ambush and
killed.  Next, in July, there was a breakthrough in peace
negotiations in Africa's oldest war, between the Arabised
Muslim northerners and southern, mostly Christian Africans
of Sudan.
</P>

<P>"There is not yet a definitive ceasefire in Sudan, but
a war that has killed two million people over 33 years
finally seems to be subsiding. Then, still in July, a
peace agreement in the Democratic Republic of Congo
(formerly Zaire) ended what has been called 'Africa's
First World War'.  Most of the six foreign armies have
already gone home, and the fighting that caused over two
million Congolese deaths in four years has subsided to
sporadic outbreaks of banditry.
</P>

<P>"The miracles then moved east, to the two longest-
running wars in Asia. In September the Liberation Tigers
of Tamil Eelam dropped their demand for a separate state
for Sri Lanka's Tamil minority, opening the way for
negotiations to end the 19-year war that has devastated
the island nation. In December, Indonesia signed a peace
deal with the separatist rebels of Aceh in northern
Sumatra, ending a 26-year war by granting the provincial
governments of the region a 70 percent share in Aceh's oil
and gas revenues.  Also in December, the Tutsi-dominated
government of Burundi signed a power-sharing agreement
with the largest of the Hutu opposition groups which
offers gives the Central African country its best chance
for peace since 1963.
</P>

<P>"There was bad news, too: a new civil war broke out in
once-stable Ivory Coast in September, and the Maoist
insurgency in Nepal, gaining strength by the month,
threatens to produce a new Year Zero in that impoverished
and misgoverned country.  But from fifteen wars only five
years ago, Africa is now down to only three or four
(depending on whether Sudan is really over), and Asia is
down to just three (in Nepal, Kashmir and the southern
Philippines).  Even allowing for one civil war in the Arab
world (Algeria) and one in Latin America (Colombia), the
world is a more peaceful place this month than it has been
at any time since September, 1939.
</P>

<P>"More peaceful, but far from out of the woods.  The
most terrifying confrontation of the past year was the
summer stand-off between India and Pakistan, two newly
fledged nuclear powers that have fought each other three
times already.  If they were to do so again, using their
new weapons, the death toll would exceed the total losses
in all the other wars of the past ten years in a matter of
days.  New Delhi and Islamabad have stepped back from the
crisis for the moment, but huge armies still face each
other across the border and the Kashmir dispute is a
permanent irritant.
</P>

<P>"Similar anxieties haunted the Korean peninsula,
where North Korea's desperately poor and isolated
Communist regime began talking up its nuclear weapons
programme, probably in the hope of shaking some extra aid
loose. Paradoxically, that may have helped Roh Moo-hyun to
win the December presidential election in South Korea on a
platform of reconciliation with the North, which will make
for difficult relations between Seoul and Washington.  But
in the main, Asia just got on about its business.
</P>

<P>"After almost a year's hesitation, China's 76-year-old
ruler,  Jiang Zemin, decided to hand the presidency on to
his designated successor Hu Jintao at the Party Congress
in November, but behind the scenes he remains very much in
control.  Earlier in the year, Malaysia's Prime Minister
Mahathir Mohamad, also 76, told his party congress that
he, too, would be retiring soon (after more than 20 years
in power).  The main difference was that Dr. Mahathir may
actually mean it.  And the release from house arrest in
May of Burma's democratic icon, Aung Sang Suu Kyi,
suggested that the military regime that has devoted the
past forty years to plundering the country may finally be
ready to make a deal.
</P>

<P>"The principal theme in Europe this year was expansion
&ndash; of NATO, to take in most of the former Warsaw Pact
countries that escaped from Soviet control in 1989, but
above all of the European Union.  After months of cliff-
hanging negotiations and a second referendum in Ireland
(the Irish had given the wrong answer the first time), the
15 EU countries showed up at the Copenhagen summit in
December and promised to take in ten new members in 2004
&ndash; Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Poland, the Czech Republic,
Slovakia, Hungary, Slovenia, Malta and Cyprus &ndash; followed
by Romania and Bulgaria in 2007.
</P>

<P>"More importantly, they gave Muslim Turkey a promise
to review its case for entry in late 2004, and to open
negotiations for Turkish membership soon afterwards if its
human rights performance continued to improve. Given that
Turkey's population will be bigger than any existing
member's by 2020, some EU countries were reluctant to make
this promise, but in the end the EU decided that it was
not just a Christian club   and the newly elected Islamic
government of Turkey, whose leaders call themselves
'Muslim Democrats', was given an incentive to keep its
promises about preserving a secular, democratic state.  As
a bonus, Ankara will push the Turkish-Cypriots to join
with the Greek-Cypriots in a reunited Cyprus before the
island enters the EU in 2004.
</P>

<P>"For the rest, it was the usual heavy traffic of
national elections in a continent of almost fifty
countries, including a bad case of tactical voting in
France that unexpectedly catapulted neo-fascist leader
Jean-Marie Le Pen into a run-off with President Jacques
Chirac in June.  (Chirac won by a margin of four-to-one.)
In the Netherlands, right-wing maverick Pym Fortuyn was
assassinated only days before the May election, sweeping
his single-issue anti-immigrant party into the new
coalition government on a massive sympathy vote (but the
leaderless party was disintegrating by year's end).
In.Germany, Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder narrowly won
another four-year term in September by promising Germans
not to take part in Mr Bush's planned war against Iraq.
</P>

<P>"The Basque terrorists started bombing again in Spain,
but the 'November 17' urban guerilla group was finally
broken in Greece after 23 murders in 27 years.  The dust
continued to settle in the Balkans, and former Serbian
dictator Slobodan Milosevic spent much of the year before
a war crimes tribunal in the Hague.  Most of the
continent's larger economies grew very slowly, but beyond
almost universal grumbling about the new currency, the
euro, Europe's discontents remained manageable.
</P>

<P>"In the Middle East, the steady US march towards war
with Iraq terrified most local governments.  The region
remained at peace except for the low-level Israeli-
Palestinian violence and the decade-old mutual
slaughter between Islamists and the military-backed regime
in Algeria, but not a single Arab regime was confident
that it could contain the potentially huge social and
political upheavals that might be unleashed by an American
invasion of Iraq.  Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, on
the other hand, thought it was a wonderful idea, and
warmly urged Washington along.
</P>

<P>"Africa, though it is gradually emerging from its
equivalent to Europe's Thirty Years' War, continued to
labour under almost every other handicap imaginable.
Encroaching famines put the lives of millions at risk both
in southern Africa and far to the north in Ethiopia and
Eritrea.  Out of 30 million Africans living with HIV/Aids,
only thirty thousand have access to anti-retroviral drugs;
the rest are condemned to an early death. In South Africa,
one in nine deaths is due to murder.
</P>

<P>"Some of the 'big men' who blighted Africa's first
post-independence generation are fading away at last &ndash;
Kenya's Daniel arap Moi allowed power to pass peacefully
to the opposition in democratic elections in December &ndash;
but others, like Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe, cling fiercely
to office even if it means the ruin of all their previous
achievements. (Unnoticed by most of the world, Namibia's
Sam Nujoma seemed to be setting out down the same path as
2002 unfolded.)  As Nigeria's President Olusegun Obasanjo
pointed out in June, corrupt African leaders have stolen
at least $140 billion from their peoples in the decades
since independence, and it's not over yet.  But at least
the wars are ending.
</P>

<P>"In Latin America there are no wars (apart from
Colombia) and the poverty most people experience is not so
absolute, but the sense of having been cheated is even
more acute.  Even where the neo-liberal promises of rapid
economic growth came true, they meant little improvement
in the lives of the poor or even the middle class; they
just made the rich even richer. So Argentina's economic
meltdown in December, 2001, led not only to a revolving-
door presidency (five presidents in two weeks) and popular
revulsion against the whole traditional political class.
It was also the starting gun for a wave of political
upheavals that is sweeping South America.
</P>

<P>"The first crisis, an unsuccessful US-backed attempt
in April to overthrow the continent's one existing left-
wing leader, President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela, was
notable for the speed with which the poorest section of
the population came to his defence despite his failure to
improve their economic plight.  That was followed by the
imposition of a state of emergency in Paraguay and
widespread looting and bank closures in Uruguay in July,
and an electoral upset in Bolivia in August that gave over
a third of the seats to candidates of Indian descent and
brought Evo Morales, leader of the Movement Towards
Socialism, to within a hair's breadth of the presidency.
</P>

<P>"Then in quick succession came the victory of Workers'
Party leader Luiz Inacio da Silva ('Lula) in the October
presidential elections in Brazil; populist Lucio
Gutierrez's capture of the presidency in Ecuador's
November elections, less than two year after he was jailed
for leading an attempted leftist coup; and a renewed
confrontation between Hugo Chavez and Venezuela's right-
wing white elite that halted oil exports from one of
America's largest suppliers in December. Almost half of
Latin America's people now live under populist left-wing
governments, and Argentina is likely to swell their ranks
after the March elections.  While the Bush administration
has been focussing obsessively on the Middle East, it has
lost control of its own back yard.
</P>

<P>"The United States remains the great conundrum of the
planet. Americans have been so traumatised by a single
large terrorist attack on their own soil that they have
effectively handed the country over to an administration
with a radical right-wing agenda for domestic change and
foreign expansion, though fewer than a quarter of them
actually voted for it.  The question is whether the
American people can recover their balance without having
to go through some painful and expensive, though
ultimately instructive experiences in the Middle East.
The answer, at the moment, appears to be no, so a great
deal of the rest of the world's business is being put on
hold."</P>
