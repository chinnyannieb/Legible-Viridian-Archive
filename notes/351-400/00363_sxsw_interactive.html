<P>"Snowfall in the Washington, DC, metropolitan area has a
pretty dramatic impact, triggering office and school

Webmaster contracting pneumonia and my travels caused a
delay in posting our latest Virtual Climate Alert.  We
apologize that it is a bit less timely than originally

Eastern Seaboard during the last two weeks have been
triggered by global warming."</P>

<P>"NZ govt to back wind farms with carbon credits
"NEW ZEALAND: March 5, 2003</P>

<P>"WELLINGTON == The New Zealand government said yesterday
it will support the development of two proposed wind farms
by giving them Kyoto Protocol climate change credits for
the clean energy they will produce.
</p>

<P>"The two wind farm projects == a 36 megawatt (MW)
extension of TrustPower's (TPW.NZ) Tararua wind farm and a
40-80 MW project proposed by state-owned Meridian Energy
== will be allocated Kyoto Protocol 'carbon credits'.
</p>

<P>"'Electricity from these wind farms would avoid some
gas or coal-fired generation, with its associated
greenhouse gas emissions,' Energy Minister Pete Hodgson
said.
</p>

<P>"'That is clearly in New Zealand's interests but the
initial costs mean that the wind farms would probably not
proceed without the credits the government is offering.'
</p>

<P>"New Zealand ratified the Kyoto accord on global
warming last December."</P>

<P><b>(((By now, for most countries on earth, it's become a
delight to ratify the Kyoto Accord merely in order to
irritate the United States of America,  that Viper Among
Nations, Threat to World Peace, Bane of the UN Security
Council, that Gunslinging Atomic Bully, Rogue State, Oil-
Grabbing Imperialist Hyperpower Hegemon, a Regime Cursed
by Pope and Ayatollah Alike, etc etc etc etc.)))</b></P>

<P>(...)
</p>

<P>"New Zealand generates around 63 percent of its
electricity needs from hydro power stations, with gas
providing around 22 percent, geothermal around seven
percent and coal about four percent. <b>(((Get rid of the
coal, Kiwis.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"Under the deal, promissory notes for Kyoto Protocol
emission units will be allocated to the power companies
depending on the final amount of generation from the wind
farms."</P>

<P>"Hello all, I am David Farris. I recently co-invented with
my 5 yr old son, a new way of building homes for the
homeless and other citizens using recycled telephone
books. This endeavor is fueled by my desire  to lessen
waste in landfills across the world and to house the
homeless in a sustainable manner.
</p>

<P>"SBC, <A HREF="http://www.housethehomeless.org/" >www.housethehomeless.org</A> and  Leadership Austin
is assisting me in establishing the avenues and volunteer
base to collect and build housing with this coming-
December's estimated 1.4 million Austin phone books.
That's enough to build 275  1500-square-foot, 4 bedroom, 2
bath homes, or enough co-housing capacity to house  2,700
homeless/displaced persons.
</p>

<P>"I have an individual offering to  have the first-ever
stackwall structure built on her property just south of
east St. Elmo Road in south Austin.  The storage shed/barn
is around 600 square feet.  Those interested in lending
their support,  expertise or funding to this work-in-
progress can call me directly at  512-407-8874 or thru
this email  stackwallproject*yahoo.com."</P>

<P>"MARCH 3, 2003</P>

<P>INDUSTRIAL MANAGEMENT</P>

<P>"A Strong Tailwind for Wind Power</P>

<P>"GE's entry == and buy-green laws == have the industry
racing ahead
</p>

<P>"In May, 2001, General Electric Co. (GE ) scooped the
assets of Enron Corp.'s wind-power division out of
bankruptcy for $285 million. Skeptics wondered why GE was
bothering with such small fry. Its own $23 billion Power
System Div. was a global leader in heavy power equipment.
The wind business as a whole, worth just $6 billion in
revenues worldwide, was too small to really matter on the
global-energy scene. And even if it did, Enron Wind ranked
fourth in an industry dominated by European companies."</P>

<P><b>(((And besides, it's merely a matter of stark human
survival.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"Nearly two years later, it's clear that GE grabbed a
cheap ticket into the fastest-growing game in the power
business. Global wind capacity has nearly quadrupled in
the past five years. Better technology has brought prices
down. And wind power has also benefited from a growing
body of local and national buy-green laws.
</p>

<P>"Now, the industry should get a big boost as GE brings
its century-long experience in turbine technology to bear.
'The wind business,' says Steven Zwolinski, president of
GE Wind Energy, 'combines a variety of technologies that
GE excels at.'
</p>

<P>"Technology has played a key role in this virtuous
cycle. Windmill blades have gotten bigger and more
efficient, as have turbines, which convert the mechanical
motion into electricity. Just two years ago, 750-kilowatt
turbines dominated the market. Today, GEWE's best-selling
model has twice that capacity. And while first-generation
turbines in the 1980s were famously unreliable, 'now,
they're up 95% of the time or more,' explains Randall
Swisher, executive director of the American Wind Energy
Assn.</P>

<P>Link:<br>
A delightful bunch of people.  Buy the T-shirts.
<A HREF="http://www.awea.org/" >http://www.awea.org/</A>
</p>

<P>"This means that new, well-sited wind towers
<b>(((yay!)))</b> can compete with coal- or gas-fired plants,
<b>(((booooooooh!)))</b>)  charging 3 cents to 6 cents per
kilowatt hour, versus around 4 cents for coal or gas. So
utilities and power developers are starting to see wind as
a cost-effective way to diversify their mix of fuel
options and not just a way to burnish a green image.
</p>

<P>"'The main driver has been cost. The price [of wind]
has come down by 80 percent over the past 20 years,' says
Lew Hey, chairman and CEO of FPL Group Inc. (FPL) The Juno
Beach (Fla.) utility == a GEWE customer == has added more
than 2,000 megawatts of wind capacity to its portfolio of
gas, coal, biomass, hydro, nuclear, and solar plants.</P>

<P><b>(((NO WAR FOR WIND, BIOMASS, HYDRO AND SOLAR!  Hey wait,
that slogan doesn't even fit on the placard here.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"Sweeteners in the form of local and federal wind-tax
credits are part of the allure.  In 1992, for example,
President George H. W. Bush <b>(((of beloved memory)))</b>
unveiled a set of federal production-tax credits, or PTCs,
which now give wind-plant operators a 1.8 cents credit for
each kilowatt hour they sell. The PTCs aren't ideal, as
they are only useful to companies such as utilities that
earn steady income. But they're a step up from earlier
investment-based credits, which gave wind producers little
incentive to maintain wind facilities after taking the
initial credit."</P>

  jazzed-up its website.
  <A HREF="http://www.treia.org/" >http://www.treia.org/</A>
  <BR>
  </DD></DL>

<P>"The current PTC is set to expire at the end of 2003.
Still, industry execs say that support for wind is greater
now than on the past two occasions the credit was renewed.
'The industry's at a point where it could probably get by
without [the PTC],' says Edwin F. Feo, a lawyer
specializing in energy finance at Milbank, Tweed, Hadley &amp;
McCloy LLP.</P>


<P><b>(((The occasional bank-crushing oil-price spike may have
its own effect, too.  Seen those pump prices lately?
Wow!)))</b>
</p>

<P>"Thanks to the rise of green-energy quotas, GEWE and
the wind biz may prosper either way. Concerned about
global warming  <b>(((no such thing)))</b> and U.S. dependence on
imported oil,  <b>(((utterly harmless, a mere myth)))</b>  more
than a dozen states have established so-called renewable-
portfolio standards that require power producers to phase
in locally generated renewable sources. California, for
example, calls for 20% by 2017; Texas producers are ahead
of schedule to produce 3% green by 2009;  <b>(((I can hear
those New Zealanders laughing from here, but c'mon, three
percent is a lot)))</b>  and in New York, the governor just
set the bar at 25% within 10 years. <b>(((Not to mention Tony
Blair's recent very interesting screed on the blatant
national-security menace of climate change.)))</b>
Link:
<A HREF="http://www.worldrevolution.org/article/663" >http://www.worldrevolution.org/article/663</A>
</p>

<P>"A similar set of national quotas == a 10% green-power
minimum for all 50 states by 2020 == was approved by the
Senate last year, and is bound to get more attention.
</p>

<P>"Accounting for just 0.25% of U.S. power output, wind
may still look like a long shot. But developments in
Europe give the industry hope. There, high fossil-fuel
costs and a steadier commitment to wind power have pumped
up wind loads to over 20% of power generation in Denmark
and Spain. AWEA expects the U.S. to achieve 6% wind by
2020 or sooner just by letting current growth trends
continue.  <b>(((Maybe they'll forge ahead  with green power
just to <STRONG>spite</STRONG> the Americans.  After all, that sure beats
trying to defeat their Air Force.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"For many states, wind may be the only cost-effective
option. Most state-level renewable quotas demand that the
green energy be produced locally. For all but a handful of
hydropower-rich states, wind is the cheapest, most
flexible, and most abundant option. The cost of power from
photovoltaic cells, for example, is five to six times that
of wind, though prices for solar have been falling.
Biomass and geothermal remain too small to compete for
now. And with dams coming under environmental scrutiny,
hydropower output is likely to decline."  <b>(((That's pretty
much the energy story, all right == but you know, it's
hard, but it's <STRONG>not impossible.</STRONG>  In fact, it's simpler
than endless warfare and vast deficits.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"GE's arrival on the scene could add a lot of
momentum. Zwolinski, who also served in GE's medical and
power-systems units, talks about turning GEWE into a $1
billion operation by applying the conglomerate's diverse
industrial expertise. GE's aerospace engineers can work on
the shape of the blades. Generators are a specialty of GE
Power Systems. The drive shaft, gearing, and control
systems are all staples of GE's industrial controls and
power operations. Add in Six Sigma tools that GE itself
perfected, and Zwolinski thinks the company could bring
the price of wind power down by an additional 20% or so.
</p>

<P>"Already, GE has unveiled the world's largest
commercial wind turbine. At 3.6 megawatts, it has more
than twice the capacity of today's standard 1.5-megawatt
models.  <b>(((They're AMERICAN-sized wind turbines! SUV-
sized! Double cheeseburger with bacon!)))</b>  Zwolinski is
also focusing on service and maintenance, applying remote
diagnostics and other technologies GE pioneered in its
medical-systems operations to predict when maintenance is
due. <b>(((And they're <STRONG>wired and digital!</STRONG>)))</b>)
</p>

<P>"'GE'S entry really changes the game. And it means a
healthier, more competitive industry,' says Terry F.
Hudgens, CEO of PPM Energy Inc., which recently installed
GE turbines in a Minnesota wind park.
</p>

<P>"Such customer confidence is a plus. But GE still
faces some significant obstacles. In its key U.S. market,
uncertainty over the timing of the PTC renewal is causing
some developers to delay big deals. And while wind is
plentiful, it often blows the hardest where nobody needs
it. So until federal rules are revised, it may be costly
for new wind projects to get connected to the grid. And
once these issues are resolved, wind's price will have to
keep falling. After all, notes Zwolinski, wind businesses
can only flourish if they deliver power at a price that
won't punish customers for going green." <b>(((Punish them
for going brown, stupid.)))</b></P>
