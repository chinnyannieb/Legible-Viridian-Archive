<dt>Attention Conservation Notice:</dt>  <dd>Leans heavily on a 
new Victoria and Albert Museum show and a spectacular 
new book by British-American design journalist Hugh Aldersey-Williams.  Lots of links.  
Basically a huge
primer on the kind of look the Viridian Movement most 
wants to promulgate.  Could prove hugely time-consuming. 
You might spend the rest of your life living in stuff 
shaped like this.</dd></DL>

<P><b>(((Public-spirited Viridian Dave Phelan 
&lt;dphelan*pavilion.co.uk&gt; shipped me this book from Britain
after reading the first Viridian Note on the subject of 
Tech Nouveau.  I am thrilled to note that this book is 
indeed Pretty Much What We Are Talkin' About. You should 
buy it right away, not the least for its 200 colour 
illustrations.  The historical timeline of zoomorphic 
buildings on pages 32-37 is worth the cost of this book 
all by itself.</P>

<P>(((Allow me, your Viridian Pope-Emperor, to 
put my shoulder behind the wheels of the V&amp;A 
and Mr. Aldersey-Williams and give you a freebie, 
down-market web-tour of what they and  this fine 
tome are on about.)))</b></P>

<P> 
<b>(((I now quote the book.)))</b></P>

<P>page 11</P>

<P>"In architecture, this development comes at an opportune 
moment.  The old dogmas of both the Modernists and theire
repudiators have collapsed.  Meanwhile, there are new 
materials and a new bravado among structural engineers 
that allow forms imagined on a computer screen actually to
be constructed.  The technical possibility and the 
cultural mood are in rare conjunction.  Freed 
from the constraints &ndash; ideological and physical &ndash; that 
favored rectilinear designs, architects are celebrating 
with an extravagant eruption of wild forms that go beyond
the merely organic and promise to usher in a period of 
biological baroque."</P>

<P><b>(((I like this analysis a lot, but I don't think an 
"extravagant eruption" of the "biological baroque" can 
or will go much beyond faddism. Tech Nouveau must possess
some ideological and physical constraints in order to 
last, because otherwise there is no grain to kick against,
and no way to measure virtuousity in performance.  The 
missing ideological and physical constraints are in 
"sustainability," which is practically nothing <STRONG>but</STRONG> a set
of constraints, and very difficult, very galling ones.)))</b></P>

<P><b>(((Why is this happening now?  For the best of reasons: 
because it's possible now!)))</b></P>

<P>page 23</P>


  <p>"Modernism as an aesthetic &ndash; the International Style &ndash; 
  may be in retreat, but the movement's underlying doctrine
  of functionalism remains unshakable for many architects,
  and a second important strain of animal architecture
  extends this functionalist tradition.  For, if we believe
  (...) that every part of a creature evolves to serve some
  function, then by following nature we seek to approach the
  ideal of total functionality.</p>
  
  <P>"This is the root of the functionalist's wish to emulate nature; and the means to do so more exactly are 
fast becoming available, as computer-aided design and 
manufacturing allow Fordist economies of scale to be 
brought not only to buildings based, like Paxton's Crystal
Palace, on the repetition of identical parts, but to 
edifices of more varied morphology assembled from unique 
components.  Leaving aside those still detained 
by the aesthetics of repetition, the entire 'high-tech' 
school now finds itself logically positioned to draw new 
lessons and inspiration from biological form."</P>

<P><b>(((You hear all that?  It's actually LOGICAL, MODERN, FUNCTIONAL and TECHNICAL to make 
huge buildings shaped
like giant seashells!  Katie, bar the door!)))</b></P>

<P>page 11</P>

<P>"There is  the problem of what to call the style, however. 'Organic' has lost its 
precision, and tends to be applied
loosely to anything with a few curves.  Labels have been 
proposed such as 'biotechnic' or 'technorganic,' but these
imply a restrictive dependence of biological form upon 
technological means."</P>

<P><b>(((Those terms do imply that restriction, and 
think that's a good idea.  It's crucial to tie the concept
of Tech Nouveau to  improvements in the means of 
production. Otherwise a vernacular, 100-percent organic 
bison-hide tepee  on raw wooden sticks will be the apex of
design.  Greens have already tried that.  That is never, 
ever going to work.)))</b></P>

  <P>"Biomorphism, a term coined during the Art Nouveau period, remains more specific than 'organic,' but suggests
that it is only shape that matters, whereas it is also 
patterns and mechanisms of building use and operation 
derived from biological models that interest a number of 
architects today."  <b>(((In other words, it's not enough 
that a structure <STRONG>looks</STRONG> like an animal &ndash; it's got to 
<STRONG>act like one.</STRONG>  This is a great point, because that 
designed behavior is the missing link that ties a 
high-tech structure to natural-capitalism and a 
McDonough-style cradle-to-cradle methodology.)))</b></P>

"Unfortunately, no one term comfortably encompasses the variety of the present trend."</P>

<P><b>(((No term will ever be perfect &ndash; even Art Nouveau had at least four major terms, if you count Jugendstil, 
Liberty Style and Arts &amp; Crafts.  Although Aldersey- 
Williams' "Zoomorphic" is a swell book title, it's not a 
great coinage for a design style; it's too exotic for 
everyday usage. "Tech Nouveau"  is, I think, the best tag
available, because it's new and catchy,  it's historically
linked to Art Nouveau, it suggests biomorphism, and it 
firmly emphasizes a technical sea change in the way 
our stuff is put together.)))</b></P>

<P><b>(((Rejoicing in a name (at long last) what Tech Nouveau needs  most right now is a showplace urban headquarters 
("XYZ, The City of Tech Nouveau") and some ardent, moneyed
fashionista group willing to become its official avant- gardists. They could show up most  
anywhere on the planet,
really.  Brazil would be great.)))</b></P>

<P><b>(((Now let me explain to you the victory condition in an 
obscure cultural struggle like this one.  If, within 18 
months or so, there is a sudden bloom of nifty 
"Tech Nouveau" suites in mags like DWELL, METROPOLIS, and
catalogs like DESIGN  WITHIN REACH, man, we Viridians are
gonna be happier people than we have ever been before! 
Otherwise, well, it's gonna be back to the ol' CAD-CAM 
drawing board, and one evil step closer to an across-the-
board Greenhouse calamity.)))</b></P>


  <P><b>(((And now &ndash; while those earlier Notes were mostly about Tech Nouveau consumer items </DT><DD>= this is the 
  big-ticket stuff, here.  Does your city or region
  have some structure like these?  It <STRONG>doesn't</STRONG>?  Then
  you're a hick, damn it!)))</b>

<P>"We would like the 'intelligent' bulding of a future 
generation to open its windows like eyelids to the dawn 
and to sense the heat in the rising sun or respond to the
chill of a breeze by raising the hairs on its back for 
insulation.  Whether it does such things literally or 
metaphorically is now the issue.  Of course, it is 
possible to engineer solutions not unlike this in 
the old brute fashion, but since nature does these things
so well it seems foolish not to sneak a look at her 
answers first.</P>

<P>"defines biomimetics as 'the abstraction of good design 
from nature.'  The qualifier 'good' is important, as is 
the term 'abstraction' &ndash; biomimetics is not about slavish imitation of nature at any cost,
 but the judicious
selection of observed properties and their subsequent 
development into sophisticated artificial technologies."</P>
