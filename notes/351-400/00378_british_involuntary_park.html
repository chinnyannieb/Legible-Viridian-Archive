<h2>"The secret of Porton Down: behind its defences, it has
created Britain's finest wildlife reserve"</h2>

<P><b>By Michael McCarthy, Environment Editor</b></P>

<P>"11 August 2003</P>

<P>"Many people probably think of it as the most sinister
site in Britain, a place of dark secrets to prompt
nightmares. Porton Down, Britain's chemical and germ
warfare defence establishment in Wiltshire, is notorious
for nerve gas and anthrax, sarin and smallpox, protective
suits and respirators, in short, horrible death (and how
to avoid it).
</p>

<P>"Yet it has another identity, known to only a few,
which makes those acquainted with it see Porton Down as a
jewel. It is a time capsule of a forgotten countryside
which has created probably the single best wildlife site
in Britain.
</p>

<P>"For example, it is beyond doubt Britain's the best
site for butterflies. The ultra-high-security 7,000-acre
Ministry of Defence estate north-east of Salisbury
consists largely of unspoiled flower-rich chalk
grasslands, dotted with woods, where 46 of our 55 native
butterfly species, or 83 per cent, have been recorded,
more than at any other location.
</p>

<P>"Never mind the common stuff, red admirals,
tortoiseshells, cabbage whites. Porton's species range
from the adonis blue to the brown argus, from the Duke of
Burgundy to the small pearl-bordered fritillary, from the
silver-spotted skipper to the marbled white. And not only
is their diversity remarkable, it is their abundance:
there are millions and millions of them. This is the
butterfly capital of Britain.
</p>

<P>"There is much more. Porton Down teeming with other
invertebrates == nearly 200 species of spider alone == and
with rare wild flowers, birds and mammals. It holds 10 per
cent of the population of one of Britain's rarest birds,
the stone curlew; it is the best site in Britain for the
juniper, a shrub that hosts its own insect world, and one
of the best sites for orchids; it has an area of anthills
so large it is referred to as 'the antscape', harbouring
three million anthills with an estimated 35 billion ants.
This is a unique corner of England: a wildlife time
capsule of the English countryside as it once was, before
intensive farming turned much of it into a biodiversity
desert.
</p>

<P>"Ironically, the nature of Porton's highly dangerous
and controversial trials work on chemical and biological
warfare (strictly defensive, the MoD is at pains to
stress, since 1956) which has made it such a wonderful
wildlife reservoir. The estate is an outlier of the chalk
grasslands of Salisbury Plain, which are botanically the
richest habitats in Britain, and time stopped after it was
bought by the Government in 1916, to become the secret
experimental centre for chemical warfare after the Germans
had begun using poison gas in the First World War
trenches.
</p>

<P>"It is the largest remaining continuous tract of chalk
downland in Britain, and nothing has been done to this
stretch of countryside since then: the farming revolution
of the 20th century, the development, the tourism, have
all passed it by. Nor has it been turned into a wasteland,
as some might suppose, by chemical warfare trials. Only
tiny parts of the 7,000 acres are directly affected by
testing operations, the MoD say, and most of the estate is
simply a huge buffer zone, to keep people well away.
Occasional trial releases of tiny amounts of nerve gas,
though some people may well find them politically
objectionable, are not disrupters of natural ecosystems."</P>

<P><b>(((I'm enjoying this article so much I can't even
say anything about it.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"The disrupters are the large-scale inputs of
chemicals, the pesticides, herbicides and artificial
fertilisers that are the essence of intensive farming. At
Porton Down, these have never arrived.  <b>((("Intensive
farming: worse than nerve gas.")))</b>
</p>

<P>"For many years, as those in charge were much occupied
with other matters, the site's astonishing wildlife
heritage more or less looked after itself (although
numerous enthusiasts on the scientific staff were aware of
how special it was). But gradually its importance has been
officially recognised by conservation designations, and by
two particular developments in the past two years: the
appointment of a full-time conservation officer, and the
provision of substantial EU funding for conservation
management.  <b>(((Well, that'll ruin it.  That, and those
blistering, unnatural heat waves.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"Stuart Corbett, a 47-year-old former agricultural
scientific adviser, is now the delighted curator of these
wildlife riches: his full-time post with the site's
operators, the Defence Science and Technology Laboratory
(DSTL), is a dream come true, he says. 'It's a wonderful,
unique place, with a lot of things still to be discovered;
it gives us a very clear idea of what we've lost in the
modern countryside.'
</p>

<P>"He finds no conflict between his role and the site's
main purpose. 'Porton Down works to protect the Armed
Forces, and now civilians as well, because of the
terrorist threat, from chemical and biological attack, and
I think the work is necessary,' he said.  <b>(((Of course, if
one is a fritillary butterfly or stone curlew, one is
clearly going to be rooting for those genocidal
terrorists.  That, or a good bio-warfare slip-up inside
the Porton Downs defence lab.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"One of his responsibilities is to help with the
Porton end of a L2.1m scheme under the EU LIFE programme
to restore the Salisbury plan grasslands where they are
being invaded by scrub. The whole programme was put
together and is managed by Stephen Davis, an English
Nature conservation officer, who is another huge
enthusiast for Porton. 'There is nowhere else like this in
the country,' he said. 'It is the wildlife secret of
Britain.'
</p>

<P>"Accompanied by both men, The Independent has visited
Porton Down, courtesy of the DSTL.  Once through the tight
security (you need a photo-pass just to get out of
reception) we found it was all it was said to be. We saw
foxes, badgers and roe deer in broad daylight; a suite of
birds that ranged from the hobby to the redstart;
wonderful wild flowers; and clouds of butterflies. In
three hours, we saw 18 species, a third of the British
total.
</p>

<P>"You can see this all too: Porton Down is open to the
public, but strictly by appointment. About 20 guided
parties are taken around each year, but you need to write
in, and there is a long waiting list, with bookings
currently being taken for the summer of 2005.
</p>

<P>"There is no doubt at all, though, that to see this
magically-preserved corner of Britain as it once was, is
worth the wait.</P>

<A NAME="_natural_riches"> </a><br>
<H2>"NATURAL RICHES</H2>

<P>"Flowers: The chalk grassland flora is the richest in
Britain: there can be 40 species in a single square metre.
Typical plants include thyme, lady's bedstraw, rock rose
and viper's bugloss, but there are many rarities such as
meadow clary (a blue member of the mint family).  <b>(((Okay,
who among us is gonna be the first to Google up an image
of some "viper's bugloss"?  With a name like that, we
Viridians may have to adopt it.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"Butterflies: Britain's largest and most diverse
population of butterflies is found at Porton Down, with 46
out of the UK's 55 species having been recorded, ranging
from the marbled white to the purple hairstreak.
</p>

<P>"Other Insects: Porton Down's other insects and
invertebrates are just as remarkable in diversity and
numbers. About 120 species of moth are caught in moth
traps each year.  <b>(((Why are they trapping them?)))</b>
</p>

<P>"Birds: The site is rich in typical downland birds
with nearly 100 species recorded from redstart to
partridges. It is one of the prime sites in Britain for a
national rarity, the stone curlew.
</p>

<P>"Mammals: Mammals include foxes, badgers and rabbits
and three species of deer (roe, fallow and muntjac)."
<b>(((Muntjac?  In Britain?)))</b></P>
