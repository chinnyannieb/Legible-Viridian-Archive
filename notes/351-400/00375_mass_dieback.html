<h2>GBN Global Perspectives</h2>
<h3>by Gwynne Dyer</h3>

<h2>Climate Change: Not Clear on the Concept
</h2>

<P>"The World Meteorological Organisation normally
produces statistics-heavy reports at the end of the year,
not news bulletins about today's weather.  Its
announcement on 2 July that the record extremes in weather
being experienced globally this year are evidence that
climate change is actually underway is therefore much more
than just another salvo in the long argument about global
warming.
</p>

<P>"In Geneva, where the WMO is based, daytime
temperatures have not fallen below 25C (77F) since late
May == the hottest June in at least 250 years.  In the
United States, May brought a record of 562 tornadoes (the
previous record for one month was 399).  In India, the
pre-monsoon heat-wave brought peak temperatures of 45C
(113F) and directly caused at least 1,400 deaths.</P>

<P><font color="green"><b>(((Imagine trying to tell that litany to a climate skeptic
in 1980.  "And what did you do about these encroaching
calamities, Mr. 2003?"  Uh... we had an oil war, man!)))</b>
</p>

<P>"As the WMO statement cautiously observed: 'New record
extreme events occur everywhere somewhere in the globe,
but in recent years the number of such extremes has been
increasing.' But there is still no sense of urgency, and
hardly anybody addresses the real context of this change.
</p>

<P>"Two weeks ago, for example, the Bush White House
censored a government report issued by the Environmental
Protection Agency that analysed global warming and its
sources.  It eliminated any suggestion that human
activities, notably industrial and vehicle emissions, were
at least partly responsible for climate change.  It
removed references to a widely accepted 1999 study showing
how sharply temperatures had risen in the previous decade
compared with the 1,000-year pattern, and substituted a
controversial later study, partly financed by the oil
industry, that disputes the evidence.  The green lobby
complained, and the media covered the story in a desultory
way, but everyone continued to behave as though there was
lots of time.  <font color="green"><b>(((Actually, everybody continued to behave
as if fossil fuels, the world's largest industry, owned
the US Administration, ignored and flummoxed the UN,
science and the media, and set the planet's military
agenda behind closed doors, because, well, such was the
case.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"The problem is that 'global warming' was the first
aspect of climate change to catch the public's attention,
and for the vast majority of people it remains the only
threat == if indeed it is a threat.  After all, warmer
isn't necessarily worse, and anyway it's a gradual process
and we'll all probably be safely dead before it gets too
serious.   Climate researchers have known that this is
untrue for about twenty years, since the evidence of the
Greenland ice-cores became available, but it has still not
affected the public debate.
</p>

<P>"Those cores go down two miles (three km.) into the
Greenland ice-cap and bring up year-by-year evidence of
weather that goes back a quarter-million years.  What the
shocked researchers realised when they examined the cores
is that climate change == REAL climate change == is not
gradual at all.  It's a threshold phenomenon, a sudden
flip into a radically different state that may then
persist for a very long time.  
</p>

<P>"The real danger we face is that gradual warming of
the sort we are experiencing now will trigger a sudden
cooling that could drop average global temperatures by 5C
(9F) in ten years.
</p>

<P>"The sudden cooling and the accompanying droughts
would destroy most of the agriculture that now sustains
six billion of us, and at least 90 percent of the human
race would be killed by famine and war in a matter of a
decade or so.  These abrupt climate changes can herald the
beginning of the next Ice Age, but climatic flips like
this can also occur for lengthy periods even in the midst
of warm-and-wet interglacial periods like the present.
</p>

<P>"We do still live in the Ice Ages, of course. <font color="green"><b>(((I love
remarks like that.)))</b> For the past three million years,
ever since continental drift closed the channel between
North America to South America and changed the ocean
currents, glaciers have covered over a third of the
planet's surface almost 90 percent of the time.  The
recent pattern has been around 100,000 years of freeze
followed by a much shorter warm period.  The previous
interglacial, which ended 117,000 years ago, was only
13,000 years long, so at 15,000 years we're already into
overtime on this one == but we don't even need a major Ice
Age to do the damage.</P>

<P>The process by which the climate flips is now
fairly well understood.  The trigger is a phase of gradual
warming that, either through glacial melting or just more
rainfall, increases the amount of fresh water on the ocean
surface between Labrador, Greenland and Norway.  This
critical part of the North Atlantic is where the Gulf
Stream's water, having become salty and dense through
evaporation, sinks to the bottom and flows back south ==
but if it is diluted by too much fresh water on the
surface, it doesn't sink and the circuit is broken.
</p>

<P>"The whole global climate suddenly flips into a cool,
dry phase that can last for many centuries before warmer
conditions return:  there have been two such episodes, at
12,500 years ago and 8,500 years ago, even since the end
of the last Ice Age.  Or the cool, dry phase could last
for a hundred thousand years if other conditions, like the
shape of the earth's orbit and the tilt of its axis, have
already put us on the brink of a new Ice Age.
</p>

<P>"The flips of the past were caused by natural warming
of one kind or another, but by adding man-made warming to
the problem we are making it far more dangerous.  We have
built all of human civilisation, and increased our
population a thousandfold, since the last cool, dry
episode.  All of that is at risk if the climate flips, and
yet the public debate is still all about gradual change."</P>

<P><font color="green"><b>(((Let's cut to the chase here and assume that a giant
switch goes off in the Atlantic and ninety percent of
everybody dies in ten years.  That would leave 600 million
people, about the population of the early 1700s.  What are
they going to do with themselves henceforth, one wonders.
There are still lots of them, and the early 1700s was a
pretty lively time.  We might assume that they'd be
reduced to Mad Max savagery by a holocaust of this
magnitude, but why? All of them?  No way.   Those 600
million survivors would have plenty of elbow room, plus
enough  leftover infrastructure for 6 billion.  The TVs
would still be on, the cellphones would work.... Assuming
that the climate is stable in its new Ice Age
configuration, this 600 million could re-create industrial
society in a jiffy and go right on burning coal.  Because
hey, it's COLD outside!)))</b></P>
