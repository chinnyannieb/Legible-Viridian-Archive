<P>"TREIA Members:</P>

<P>"The Renewable Energy Roundup (The Roundup
<br><A HREF="http://www.TheRoundup.org/">www.TheRoundup.org</A>) is just three weeks away. The scramble
is on for the last few exhibit spaces. If you haven't
lined up your booth yet NOW IS THE TIME TO DO SO! We have
already logged 65 exhibitors and other commitments have
been made but not yet received. And the full speaker
agenda is now posted on the web site.</P>

<P>"Also, don't forget, we need more sponsorships in order to
help us make sure TREIA and TXSES end up with revenue for
future projects and activities. Copy and layout work has
begun on 'The Lariat' (the onsite program guide w/a 7,000+
print run). To be sure you are recognized in it, please
notify me of your sponsorship by Tuesday the 9th.
Sponsorships after that date will still be recognized on
the main sponsor sign at The Roundup gate.</P>

<P>"Sponsorship has not yet been secured for the very popular
Friday evening Trail Dust Reception for exhibitors,
speakers, sponsors, volunteers and invited dignitaries.
Any company, or a group of companies, can step up and
claim the rights by providing a total of $3,500. There
will be sign recognition at the event, and recognition
from the standard sponsor benefits list as well, in the
appropriate categories for each company's contribution.</P>

<P>"Please call me if you would like to discuss exhibiting or
sponsorship options."</P>

<H2>CORPORATE SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING CONTINUES TO MOVE</H2>

<P>AHEAD, WITH CHALLENGES</P>

<P>An increasing number of corporations are taking on the
voluntary task of producing corporate sustainability
reports. According to the Global Reporting Initiative
(GRI), more than 2,000 companies have voluntarily
published environmental, social, or sustainability reports
to date, with over 300 companies utilizing the reporting
guidelines prepared by the GRI.</P>

<P>The GRI is an independent international organization
founded with the purpose of standardizing corporate
sustainability reporting (much the same way that financial
reporting has a set of standardized accounting practices).
The GRI Sustainability Reporting Guidelines outline
specific information requirements for reporting on an
organization's environmental, social and economic
performance.</P>

<P>While some companies have complained that the GRI
guidelines are too demanding, an increasing number of
companies continue to adopt them in their reporting.
Notably, Ford and Weyerhauser--two companies closely
scrutinized over environmental issues--recently released
their GRI-based corporate citizenship reports. BC Hydro,
the Canadian utility company, recently became among the
first to completely integrate the GRI's "triple bottom
line" reporting into its regular annual report. Even a
whole stock market has gotten in on the game: as of
September 1, 2003 all companies listed on the Johannesburg
Securities Exchange (JSE) are required to use GRI
guidelines for disclosing their social and environmental
performance.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, some GRI critics complain that the reporting
guidelines are not stringent enough, because in some cases
they allow companies to make broad statements of policy,
instead of providing exact measurements of their successes
and failures. A lack of third-party verification of many
GRI-based reports threatens their credibility. To overcome
such problems, the UK group AccountAbility has proposed
new "materiality" standards regarding social and
environmental reporting (as reported here earlier). The
AccountAbility standards would further increase the
pressure for verified accuracy in corporate sustainability
reporting.</P>

<P>Though applauded by many, ever-higher reporting standards
may also have a rather ironic result: a deep chill in
corporations' enthusiasm to report their sustainability
practices. The stakes for corporations are high. In Nike
v. Kasky, a legal case that recently appeared before the
US Supreme Court, the Nike corporation was sued for
allegedly making inaccurate statements about its use of
illegal labor in Asia. In returning the case to the lower
courts, the US Supreme Court has left open the question of
whether US corporations can get sued for false or
inaccurate claims made in corporate communications such as
GRI-compliant reports. Cases like this put pressure on
companies to ensure that their reports are true and
accurate ... but is also likely to dampen U.S.
corporations' interest in publishing such reports in the
near term.</P>

<P>"Standards around sustainability reporting are going
through turbulent times, but the field is still very
young. Financial accounting standards also went through a
lengthy birth process ... and of course, the waters still
get turbulent there, too."</P>

<H2>EUROPEAN LAWS INSPIRE CALIFORNIA ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES</H2>

<P>California, long considered a progressive leader in U.S.
environmental policy, is now looking to the European Union
for inspiration. The city of San Francisco recently
adopted the "Precautionary Principle" core tenant of EU
environmental policy == which calls for caution in
approving potentially damaging technologies. The
California state legislature voted last year to reduce
greenhouse gases and recently outlawed two chemical flame
retardants already scheduled for prohibition under EU law.
Thanks to the state's enormous economy, California state
laws have a way of transforming industry practice
nationwide, a term policy wonks call the "California
effect."</P>

<P>If you are pursuing a lifestyle of health and
sustainability, there's a name for you: "Loha."</P>

<P><b>(((Huh?)))</b></P>

<P>The term was created by marketers to describe consumers
who incorporate environmental and social issues into their
purchase decisions. The Natural Marketing Institute, the
US research and consulting firm that coined the term,
estimates that a third of the adult population could be
considered Lohas. If that's true, not all of them are
putting their money where their hearts may be. While 40
percent of Americans recently surveyed said they had
bought organic food and beverages, such products account
for only 2 percent of the annual $600 billion in food and
beverage sales in the United States.</P>

<H2>MEGA-CONSUMERS KEY TO SUSTAINABILITY</H2>


<P>A new Worldwatch Institute report says that "mega-
consumers" such as corporations, governments, universities
and international organizations have a crucial role in
bringing about a sustainable world. These large-scale
consumers spend billions of dollars every year, affecting
the health of many of the world's most fragile ecosystems.
The report: Purchasing Power: Harnessing Institutional
Procurement for People and the Planet == details how the
centralized purchasing strategy of mega-consumers allows
single decisions by executives and procurement personnel
to have an enormous practical impact.</P>

Recent evidence collected by NASA shows that the rate of
ozone destruction has markedly declined and that ozone in
the very uppermost portions of the atmosphere may start to
recover within several years. If ozone-depleting chemicals
remain banned according to the terms of the Montreal
Protocol, the entire upper atmosphere is expected to
recover fully before the end of the 21st century. However,
the terms of the Montreal Protocol are being threatened by
recent US efforts to increase the use of methyl bromide, a
pesticide that, among industrialized countries, poses the
largest remaining threat to the ozone layer. The chemical
is scheduled for a complete ban under the treaty in 2005
but the Bush administration is demanding exemptions from
the treaty, which could lead to a 3-fold increase in its
use.</P>

Tesco, Britain's largest retailer, has been expelled from
a green trade group for selling timber illegally harvested
from Indonesian rainforests. Tesco was thrown out of the
"95+ Group", an ethical trading initiative run by the
World Wildlife Fund UK, for selling millions of pounds'
worth of hardwood garden furniture made from logs that
Indonesia banned from export. Rachel Hemberry, manager of
the 95+ Group says that Tesco has also refused to answer
the key questions about its timber supply posed to it by
the 95+ Group. "Tesco fails to understand the issues and
is not committed to the aims of the group," she said.</P>

Who's for nuclear power as a solution to global warming?
Nuclear power manufacturers, certainly. But the French,
who enjoy low CO2 emissions thanks to their heavily
reliance on nuclear, may have gotten the first of many
second thoughts this summer as the summer heat pushed
reactor cooling systems up to levels that were dangereux.
One reactor (Fassenheim) on the river Rhine was sprayed
with hoses from the outside because of dangerously high
temperatures (the spectacle was shown on French TV). Even
the conservative financial weekly "The Economist" has
decided that nuclear power is not a good investment and
poor security risk. The U.S. Congress, meanwhile, is
likely to extend the Price-Anderson act, which provides
unlimited government insurance for nuclear operators in
case of "catastrophic accidents" == .just when insurance
companies are beginning to absolve themselves of risk
associated with terrorism.</P>

<H2>US TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM: EXPENSIVE, SUBSIDIZED AND</H2>

<P>UNHEALTHY
An automobile-centered transportation system is costing US
citizens an (overweight) arm and a leg. A new report by
the Surface Transportation Policy Project finds that the
average U.S. family now spends 19% of their income on
transportation, while the poorest families devote more
than 40% of their household budget to getting around. Not
only are these costs high, but a Minnesota study reveals
that the annual subsidies enjoyed by automobile users are
nearly 20 times as high as the subsidies to public
transportation. These findings may come as a surprise to
those who believe that automobiles drivers pay their own
way. Frequent drivers could be bearing a hefty cost when
it comes to their health, however: a recent US study
showed that those living in suburban neighborhoods weigh,
on average, 6 pounds more than their urban counterparts.</P>

<P>"It appears more government investment in public transit
and a greater variety of transportation choices could help
reduce transportation expenses as well as American
waistlines."</P>

<P>Old news for some people, still new for most</P>

<A NAME="heard_about_those_great_new__corn-based_plastics__"> </A>
<H2>HEARD ABOUT THOSE GREAT NEW "CORN-BASED PLASTICS"?</H2>

<P>A recent news story caught our attention here at AtKisson,
Inc. and led to a very interesting internal debate: are
corn-based plastics really more climate friendly than
their traditional fossil-fuel based counterparts? It
appears that, generally, the process of making plastic
from biomass actually emits more greenhouse gases than
plastics made from fossil fuels. This apparent irony is
explained in the August 2000 Scientific American article,
"How Green are Green Plastics?" The reason green plastics
tend not to be so green after all is the greater amount of
energy required to transform the raw biomass materials
into usable plastic. This energy generally comes from ==
you guessed it == fossil fuels. This critique left us
skeptical about the bio-plastic claims.</P>

<P>However, we also ran across a detailed product life-cycle
analysis (LCA) completed by Cargill Dow, the manufacturer
of PLA. PLA is the "corntainer" plastic that recently
appeared in the news and was identified in the Scientific
American article as the one biomass plastic that seems to
have a chance of competing with fossil-fuel plastics  on
greenhouse gas emissions. The LCA concluded, that if
produced using renewable energy sources (wind power and
corn are both abundant in the Midwest), the PLA would beat
all other plastics on greenhouse gas emissions. In fact,
PLA would actually temporarily take carbon out of the
atmosphere, storing it in usable products and the not-yet-
decomposed PLA deposited in landfills.</P>

<P>The manufacturer expects PLA production to evolve into
this true-green alternative in the near future.</P>

<P>"The take-away lessons: 1) it's important to remain
skeptical about industry claims, and 2) good-faith,
truthful self-reporting by corporations can do much to
clear the air on complex sustainability issues."</P>

<H2>HEINZ CENTER'S "THE STATE OF THE NATION'S ECOSYSTEMS"</H2>

<P>Published in the autumn of 2002, this report sets the
standard for environmental indicator reporting in the U.S.
The report presents data on 103 environmental indicators
at the national level in a factual and non-judgmental way.
The scientifically sound and non-partisan indicators were
selected by 150 individuals from businesses, environmental
organizations, universities, and federal, state, and local
government agencies.</P>

Published in July 2003, this book highlights the companies
and people behind ten key technological breakthroughs that
are helping to protect the climate and/or the ozone layer.
The book details the challenges and triumphs in the
process of innovating new technologies that protect the
environment while turning a profit.</P>

<H2>EU STRATEGY FOR SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT</H2>

<P>Earlier in this issue of WaveFront, we mentioned how
California was taking inspiration from EU environmental
policy. Now you can do the same through some online
reading about the EU strategy for sustainable development.
The strategy, adopted by the European Council in
Gothenburg in June 2001, focuses on four key-priorities:
climate change and clean energy; public health; managing
natural resources; and transportation and land use. The
site has a fantastic collection of links for further
reading.</P>

This US report is the product of nearly a decade of work
by government and private-sector scientists. The authors
explored possible scenarios of global warming using
computer models and historical climate data. The
conservative think tank Competitive Enterprise Institute,
claiming that global warming poses no real economic,
environmental, or health risks, sued the Bush
administration over the "alarmist" report.</P>

<H2>MORE INFORMATION: WINDPOWER IN INDIA</H2>

<P>Aromar Revi, an AtKisson network associate based in India,
commented on our wind power story (WaveFront Issue #2),
pointing out that India has the 5th largest installed wind
power base in the world, after Germany, USA, Spain and
Denmark. The country generates 1,860 Megawatts. India also
recently passed a new electricity that eases the way for
further wind power generation.</P>

<H2>CORRECTION: SOYBEANS IN THE AMAZON</H2>

<P>In our story on how soybeans were contributing to the
deforestation of the Amazon basin (WF Issue #2), we made a
quip that now even tofu shares the blame, along with
cattle. WaveFront reader Sat Jiwan Khalsa helped set us
straight about the issue, pointing us to research that
shows that 87% of the soybeans will actually go to feed
European livestock.</P>

<P><b>(((Does this explain BSE?  I thought 87% of European
livestock ate the flesh of other European livestock.)))</b></P>
