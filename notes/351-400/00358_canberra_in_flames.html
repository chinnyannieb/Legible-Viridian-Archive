<H2>Canberra in panic as four die in 'worst bushfires ever'</h2>

<h3>By Kathy Marks in Melbourne</he>

<P>20 January 2003</p>

<P>"Thick smoke blanketed the Australian capital,
Canberra, yesterday and a layer of ash coated the white
Parliament building after forest fires raced into the
city, killing four people and destroying 400 homes.
<b>(((Alternate headline: "Brutal Evidence of Greenhouse
Effect Literally Coats Parliament Building.")))</b>
</p>

<P>"Emergency services remained on high alert as
authorities warned that hot, windy weather forecast for
today could whip up flames that are still burning in
bushland around the city. More than 1,000 people remained
in evacuation centres, while others were allowed to return
to the wreckage of their suburban homes.
</p>

<P>"The firestorms that hit Canberra on Saturday, laying
waste to suburban streets and overwhelming firefighters,
were the capital's worst. 'This is certainly the most
devastating bushfire experience that any community in
Australia has ever suffered,' said John Stanhope, Chief
Minister of the Australian Capital Territory.
</p>

<P>"Mr Stanhope defended emergency services against
criticism that they were unprepared for the scale of the
disaster, ((As if Australian firemen invented climate
change.  Try defending ExxonMobil)))</b>   with hundreds of
householders left to fight the flames alone with buckets
and garden hoses.  <b>((("Failed to Think Globally, Have to
Act Locally'.  "At least I can afford this handy garden
hose after getting those carbon taxes off my back.")))</b>
</p>

<P>'It was a one-in-100 or 200 years' experience, an event
of such enormity, of such force and such devastating power
that it simply ran over the top of us,' he said.  <b>((('One
in a hundred.' Why do they keep saying that?  Go talk to
some weather insurance people.)))</b></P>

<P>Link:<br>
<A HREF="http://www.enn.com/news/enn-stories/2002/08/08272002/s_47833.asp" class=BigLink">http://www.enn.com/news/enn-stories/2002/08/08272002/s_47833.asp</A>
</p>


<P>"The bushfires that swept into the suburbs,  <b>(((The
"Bush" Fires.  It's almost too easy)))</b>   driven by hot,
strong winds and fuelled by tinder-dry pine forests and
grasslands, had been burning in mountains west of the
capital for weeks. Most were started by lightning strikes.
</p>

<P>"Don Horan, a resident of the worst-affected
neighbourhood, Duffy, saw the wall of fire approaching.
'It knocked me off my feet,' he said. 'I ran inside. When
the fireball had passed, the sky rained burning embers.
</p>

<P>"'It was horrendous. The whole area just blew up.
Then the fire got underneath my house and I knew I had to
get out. I just grabbed the two cats and ran for it.' The
victims, including a 61-year-old man and an 83-year-old
woman, died of smoke inhalation in Duffy.
</p>

<P>"A total of 260 Canberra residents were injured and
50 remained in hospital yesterday including three who were
in a critical condition with severe burns. As well as
politicians and diplomats, Canberra is home to 350,000
ordinary Australians, many of them attracted by the
beautiful bushland that rings the city. One of the worst
droughts in a century has turned the vegetation == which
is fire-prone at the best of times == into a tinder-box.
</p>

<P>"John Howard, the Prime Minister, cut short his
annual holiday to tour fire-ravaged areas and comfort
residents. 'I have been to a lot of bushfire scenes in
Australia, but this is by far the worst,' he said. 'A man,
a veteran of World War Two, showed me his charred medals.
One lady, clearly traumatised, said that she had lost
everything.'</P>

country'

</p>

<P>"Power and communications were severely affected by
the fires, with an estimated one-quarter of homes without
electricity yesterday and raw sewage threatening to spill
into a river system that supplies water for a large area
of south-eastern Australia.  <b>(((Nice 'Wexelblat Disaster'
angles here.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"Authorities warned of an extreme danger of fire over
the next two days.
</p>

<P>"'You've got just about every tree, the whole root
system, still smoking,' said Mike Castle, director of
emergency services. There are fears that nine fires could
merge to form an unstoppable wall of flames.  <b>(((My, that
would be very remarkable.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"As firefighters strengthened defences around the
capital,  <b>(((note Khaki Green paramilitary rhetoric
here)))</b> residents of Duffy sifted the charred remains of
their homes. Melted garden hoses lay strewn like snakes
across blackened lawns and the streets were full of
wildlife including birds, kangaroos and dogs, some dead,
some alive.
</p>


<P>"Ross White, a psychologist in Duffy, who lost his
house and all his client files to the flames, said: 'All I
have is the clothes I'm wearing and a garden gnome.'
<b>(((With a wit like that, Dr White won't lack for
clients.)))</b></P>

<P>"Authorities admitted they were helpless to prevent
the firestorm which engulfed parts of the city's western
and southern suburbs, overwhelming the national capital's
meagre firefighting resources.  <b>((("Authorities admitted
they were idiots to knuckle under to fossil fuel
companies, promised immediate climate policy changes for
survival of the national capital."  No, no, they'd much
rather be helpless, actually.  Enjoy breathing that smoke,
lawmakers.)))</b></P>


<p>
(...)
</p>


<P>"Cooler and calm weather gave firefighters some
respite today and enabled authorities to declare all fires
under control by 4pm.  But the state of emergency
remained, with higher temperatures over the coming two
days threatening a repeat of Saturday's disaster.  <b>(((What
if most of the firefighters had died inside some
skyscraper?)))</b>
</p>

<P>"Among the casualties was the historic Mt Stromlo
astronomical observatory, where fire largely destroyed the
79-year-old facility, causing an estimated $20 million
damage.  <b>(((The burning observatory.  What a Ballardian
image.)))</b></P>

<P>(...)
</p>

<P>"Prime Minister John Howard cut short his holidays
for a briefing on the disaster and to visit those who lost
their homes.  <b>(((Does this Prime Minister have any idea
what is really happening to himself and his people, do you
suppose?  And its direct relevance to his own behavior?
"Gosh, climate change has ruined my vacation, as well as
threatening to consume my capital wholesale.  Could this
problem get really serious?  No, no, too farfetched!")))</b>
</p>

<P>"He held talks with Mr Stanhope and promised federal
disaster relief funds would be made available.  <b>(((There
are infinite supplies of disaster relief funds; they come
right out of the deficits.  Taxing coal, on the other
hand, man, that could hurt the economy.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"'I have been to a lot of bushfire scenes in
Australia... and this was by far the worst,' Mr Howard
told reporters.
</p>


<P>"The ACT government has pledged $10,000 assistance
for people who lost uninsured homes.  <b>((("The world is
becoming uninsurable."  Good luck insuring the house if
you dare to rebuild, mate.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"As people returned to their burned homes today, many
expressed anger at the lack of support from ACT fire
crews, who were overwhelmed by the blaze as it raced into
suburban areas.  <b>(((Maybe someday they'll point a finger
at the actual malefactors:  the fossil fuel industries.
"No firefighter blood for oil.")))</b></P>

<p>
(...)
</p>

<P>"But Mr Stanhope told reporters emergency services
did all they could but had no way of stopping the
disaster.   'We were faced yesterday with an event that
would happen perhaps once every 100 or 200 years, the like
of which has never been seen in Canberra,' he said.
<b>(((That's right, Mr Chief Minister.  It's never been seen
before now.  And that's no coincidence, either. You can
expect to see a lot more of it.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"Mr Stanhope said the ACT urban fire service had only
12 tankers at its disposal, which would normally be enough
to fight six house fires simultaneously.  But they would
have needed up to 800 fully staffed fire trucks to have
saved all the houses.  <b>(((Interesting math here.
Presumably, sometime around the 2060s when weather damage
costs outpace the global GNP, everybody on Earth becomes a
fireman.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"'It was a holocaust of an extent that we simply did
not and could not possibly have had the capacity to deal
with,' Mr Stanhope said.   <b>(((That makes a nice epitaph.
A little wordy, maybe.  The Mayans could have chiselled
that into a nice tall plinth just before their
civilization collapsed.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"'They did everything humanly possible; they risked
their lives, they went out of their way, they put their
lives on the line in an attempt to save lives and save
property and I defend them, I defend them absolutely.'
<b>(((How many firemen know that they're fighting the
Greenhouse here?  Australia is rather known for its Green
contingent; there must be at least a few firemen who are
aware that the nature of their job is changing just as the
climate does, and that they are being flung into a
meatgrinder that their grandfathers never faced.)))</b></P>

<h2>"Canberra counts the cost"</h2>

<p>
(...)
</p>

<P>"Acting chief health officer Dr Charles Guest says
Canberra's hospitals have been inundated with more than
600 people seeking treatment in last 48 hours.
</p>

<P>"'A lot of the people presenting have minor emergency
problems and then there have been the major issues the
burns that have gone Sydney,' Dr Guest said.  'We're
seeing people with smoke inhalation, there's been lots of
minor burns, fractures.' (...)</P>

<P><b>"Landmarks lost</b>
</p>

<P>"The list of Canberra landmarks lost in the fires
includes almost the entire ACT softwood plantations, the
Uriara and Mount Stromlo forestry settlements, and all
Canberra's public health laboratories.   <b>(((Public health
labs on fire.   Good moment for a biological warfare
attack.  Or, what the heck, just get two guys from Al
Qaeda and start dropping matches in the woods.  They could
destroy the capital of Australia.  Really, they could.
Just calling in an Islamic phone claim with terrorist
arson threats would be enough to drive people wild.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"Australia's oldest active observatory Mt Stomlo, has
been extensively damaged in the fires.  Helicopter
observations have revealed its handful of giant domes are
either burnt to the framework or molten masses of metal.
Its offices and research facilities are also severely
burnt.   <b>(((Somebody find me the photo online.  A molten
observatory.  Man oh man, what a 21st-century
signifier.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"Mr Jon Stanhope says the damage bill is expected to
run into the hundreds of millions of dollars.  <b>(((Charge
it to the former Global Climate Coalition.)))</b>  He says
families who have lost their homes will receive $10,000 in
immediate assistance.  <b>(((While their insurance and taxes
consequently skyrocket.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"Governor-General Peter Hollingworth has issued a plea
for people not to lay blame for the devastation.  'We must
not go on with recrimination,' he said.  'The fact of the
matter is Australia is a high incendiary place.'  <b>(((That
is not the whole fact of the matter, Mr Governor-General.
The fact of the matter is that Australia is a coal-
exporting, coal-using country that has taken an
unconscionable risk with the biosphere, and now, with
almost Biblical accuracy, your political center is reaping
an almighty flaming whirlwind.  You <STRONG>must</STRONG> go on with
recriminations, because your own policies make your own
nation pathetically vulnerable to climate extremes.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"Meanwhile, Western Australia's acting Health Minister
Sheila McHale has offered Canberra the services of medical
staff from Royal Perth Hospital, who treated victims of
the Bali tragedy.  <b>(((Don't even get me started on the
nexus of ironies here.)))</b></P>

<P>(...)</P>

<P><b>"Power cuts</b>
</p>

<P>"About 15,000 Canberra residents remain without power
after Saturday's devastating fires in the ACT, where
blackouts continue to affect more than 30 suburbs.    As
the fires raged on Saturday there were reports of power
poles exploding.  <b>(((Fossil fueled power poles, no
doubt.)))</b>
</p>

<P><b>"New South Wales</b>
</p>

<P>"Weather conditions are likely to worsen today in the
Kosciusko National Park and 12 tankers are on standby to
cater for the grim forecast.  Firefighters were able to
resume waterbombing on the large blaze due to calmer
weather conditions yesterday.  <b>((("Khaki Green" is the
Viridian term for militarization under Greenhouse

coinage.)))</b></P>
