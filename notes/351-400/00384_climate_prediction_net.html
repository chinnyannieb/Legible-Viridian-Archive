First announced on Viridian List way back in 1999,  the
climate-predicting network  would appear to be here at
last!

<P>Get yours now!  Help real climate scientists grasp the
worst!  And they're British too, so they might even be
allowed to talk to us about what they find out!

<P>They are in fact working on a Linux port!

<h2>"Huge Climate Experiment Starts Today - All Welcome"</h2>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>UK: September 12, 2003<BR></P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>"MANCHESTER, England == A climate prediction experiment
which is expected to involve two million people around the
world and produce a probable forecast for the 21st century
will be launched today.  <b>(((Yay!)))</b></P>

<P>"Anyone with a personal computer <b>(((even Moslems and
Republicans!)))</b> can join the project and will be expected
to conduct their own unique version of Britain's Met
Office climate model, simulating several decades of the
Earth's climate at a time.</P>

<P>"'Everybody gets their own model so they can do an
interesting bit of research on their PC,' Dr Myles Allen,
of the University of Oxford, told a British Association
science conference on Thursday.  <b>(((What a mensch!  Four
solid years of work to boot that project!  This Allen guy
doesn't kid around!  Kudos!)))</b></P>

<P>"The results of the experiment will be sent via the
Internet. The simulations will be used to test different
model versions and the results will be collated to predict
the 21st century climate.</P>

<P>"'We can't predict which versions of the model will be any
good without running these simulations, and there are far
too many for us to run them ourselves,' said Allen.</P>

<P>"'Together, participants' results will give us an overall
picture of how much human influence has contributed to
recent climate change and the range of possible changes in
the future,' he added.</P>

<P>"Allen said the program, which can be downloaded from
<br><a href="http://www.climateprediction.net/">www.climateprediction.net</A>, can run on an ordinary desktop
or laptop computer.  It is easy to operate and does not
slow down other tasks on the computer.  <b>(((Help science
learn the worst while reading Viridian email!)))</b></P>


<P>"The project, which is billed as the world's largest
climate prediction experiment, is a collaboration between
the Met Office and several universities including Oxford
and Reading."</P>
