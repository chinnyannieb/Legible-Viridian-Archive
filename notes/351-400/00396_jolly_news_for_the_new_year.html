<P>The year 2003 was the world's third hottest year ever,
but hey, at least 2003 wasn't the hottest-hottest
ever.  A lot of us survived 2003, even in Europe!

<P>This is the oddest and most interesting good news
of the season.  Concentrations of methane, a serious greenhouse gas, have somehow levelled 
off in the atmosphere.  Nobody quite knows why this has happened, but, well, without any 
kind of apparent major effort on humanity's part, methane has simply stopped increasing 
after 200 solid years of growth.</P>

<p>"Greenhouse gases level off</P>

<P>"Concerted efforts could further fall of methane. 28 November 2003</P>

<P>by Helen Pearson</P>

<P>"Levels of the greenhouse gas methane have plateaued for the first time in around 200 
years, shows a new report.</P>

<P>"Methane is second only to carbon dioxide in contributing to our planet's warming. 
  The gas == belched out by fossil-fuel burning, rice paddies, festering farm manure and 
  landfill sites == has been accumulating steadily since the Industrial Revolution.</P>

<P>"Now the tide may be turning, say Ed Dlugokencky of the National Oceanic and 
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in Boulder, Colorado, and his team. They found that 
levels steadied between 1999 and 2002, according to measurements from 43 ground-based 
stations around the world.</P>

<P>"The reason for the change is unclear. Dlugokencky believes that a major contributing 
factor was the break-up of the Soviet Union in 1991. Oil and gas production fell, and the 
industry became more efficient at plugging gas leaks from pipes and wells.  <b>(((Communists 
did that,
eh? After 200 years?  Really? No kiddin'?)))</b></P>

<P>"Experts are keen to point out that the plateau is no cause for complacency. <b>(((As far 
as I can figure, there's just plain "no cause".)))</b> Increasing fossil-fuel consumption in 
developing nations, or renewed drilling for natural gas, might boost methane again. 'The 
trajectory is still moving up, in my opinion,' says atmospheric chemist David Blake of the 
University of California, Irvine.
</P>

<P>"Indeed, says Blake, the finding highlights how small steps to cut methane emissions 
could slow global warming. Leaking gas pipelines could be capped, for example, and 
incentives introduced to encourage landfill owners and farmers use methane to run power 
generators.
<b>(((Yeah, yeah but... well, this kind of begs the question of what's actually going on up 
there.  Is there less methane emitted somehow, or maybe some kind of unknown mechanism 
kicking in to destroy it more quickly in the atmosphere? Nobody's got the foggiest.)))</b></P>

<P>"Gas bill</P>

<P>"Earlier studies hinted at a slowing in the long-term rise in methane == but 
  Dlugokencky's conclusion is based on particularly frequent and accurate measurements. 'He 
  can connect the dots in a more accurate way than we can,' explains Blake.</P>

<P>"Accumulating methane is thought to prevent heat escaping from Earth into space, like 
the thickening blanket of carbon dioxide. It probably accounts for roughly 20% of the 
warming effects of greenhouse gases, compared with the 40-50% attributed to carbon 
dioxide.
<b>(((So this is kind of big deal, really.  Too bad
nobody understands it.)))</b></P>

<P>"Human activities pump out more than two-thirds of the methane in the atmosphere, the 
rest comes mainly from natural wetlands. Methane survives an average of nine years in the 
sky before it is broken down in reactions with short-lived compounds called hydroxyl 
radicals.</P>

  <P>"A quickening of this destruction might partly explain the methane plateau. Changes 
  in climate can also alter the amount oozed by wetlands. 'A collection of things has 
  resulted in this trend,' says Elaine Matthews, who studies methane emissions at the 
  Goddard Institute for Space Studies at Columbia University in New York.  <b>(((A "collection 
  of things"?  Wow, that sounds like a pretty safe assessment.  Maybe one could use that to 
  get out of a speeding ticket == "Er, a 'collection of things' caused me to exceed the 
  speed limit, officer!")))</b>
