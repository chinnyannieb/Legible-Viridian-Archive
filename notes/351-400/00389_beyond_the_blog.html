<DL><dt>Key concepts:</dt> <dd>blogging, Wired Magazine</dd>

<dt>Attention Conservation Notice:</dt> <dd>yet more about
the Pope-Emperor's non-Viridian activities; involves
weblogs, notoriously an effort in which other
people have to do all the work.</dd></DL>

<P><b>(((It might seem that I've had little to do<BR>
with environmental activities lately, but I was
busily attending  the "Eternally Yours" conference
in Eindhoven and the latest AIGA conference in
Vancouver.  Two stellar events, as green-design
gigs go. I learned a lot.  Someday I'll tell you
all about it. If I can make the time, that is.)))</b></P>

<P><BR>
<b>(((This AIGA gig was particularly and relentlessly
Green, right down to the recyclable lanyard badges
and recycled, chlorine-free paper.  Maybe it was
because AIGA was held outside the USA this year,
but most every American graphics pundit who<BR>
took the stage seemed to have something angry,
ashamed and bitter to say about the Bush Administration.
Mind you, these are sweet, mild-mannered graphic-artsy
people who  in happier circumstances should have been
talking about, I dunno, serifs or something.  I wasn't surprised to see some of this 
sentiment, but the universality of it was a little unnerving, frankly.)))</b></P>

<P><b>(((In the meantime, I have gone and started a new daily
weblog.)))</b></P>

<P><b>(((I'm busily working on a "Beyond the Beyond" Frequently
Asked Questions list, too.  Because (thanks to the
fact that my weblog is associated with a major
magazine) quite a lot of "Beyond the Beyond" fanmail
is already showing up in my emailbox!  Wow!</P>


<P><b>(((My new blog's FAQ not quite ready for prime-time yet,
though, so  I thought I might share it with Viridian List
first.)))</b></P>

  You fucking cyberpunk dilettante!  Call yourself
  a blogger?  Where's the RSS feed?  Every blog
  that matters has an RSS feed! You suck!

  I perceive that there is no commentary allowed on your
  blog. This is an outrage and an affront against the spirit
  that made the Internet what it is today.  You do make some
  mildly interesting points, but your pathetic, half-
  educated drivel  cannot survive in the online world
  without  my magisterial addenda.   When will you put
  this to rights?

  Let me get this straight.  You and your, uh,
  employers, you and them somehow  expect me to actually
  <STRONG>log on</STRONG> to your stupid <STRONG>website</STRONG>?  Where's the RSS?
  I'd explain to you what "RSS" means, but I'm busy having
  my lunch homogenized so that I can inject it
  straight into my arteries.

  Hey wait a minute.  This is some kind of Tripod or
  Lycos software you're using, right?  Why don't you build
  your own blog from scratch, like a real blogger?  Maybe
  you can build something cool that blows up so big and
  badly that Google buys you out.

<OL type="A" start="1">

  I've got an even better idea.  You can build it, and
  give it to me, and then pay me to write on it.  And, while you're at it, where's the 
  RSS?  Be real sure that RSS feed doesn't blow up the custom template, okay?</LI>

  These seem to be some pretty interesting websites
  you've discovered, but you don't say much about them.
  At least, not enough to suit me.  You should work harder.
  Can't you explain them a lot more thoroughly?  I'm getting
  kind of confused.

  Those women are not Iranian.  It's the photographer
