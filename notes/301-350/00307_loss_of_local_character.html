<p>Key concepts: maple trees, regional changes in vegetation, New England, sugar industry</p>


<P>Attention Conservation Notice:  Lots of links
about politics, drought, typography, whatever.
Includes new web-toy we'd like you to try.</P>

<P>Our New Viridian Web Toy!</P>

<P>Click on that hotlink that reads "how's yer weather," and a
nifty global map shows up.  Why not tell us about some weather
atrocity that's taken place in your Viridian vicinity?  Caution:
pointer arrow seems to shoot a little high.</P>

<P>Former EPA honcho explains the everyday facts about the fossil energy
business owning the Bush Administration.

<P>Upset with failing to crush the Kyoto Treaty, the Administration
now sensibly ambushes climate scientists.  Why not just arrest
the scientists? All that stuff they're telling us is pretty terrifying.

<P>Actually, it wasn't the Administration; mostly, it was the doing of
Exxon-Mobil.  Shouldn't these people be in jail in some cage
in Cuba?  They're ruthless, sneaky and incredibly dangerous.

hot and bothered when period movies use anachronistic typefaces.

<P>"Global Warming Not A Sweet Deal for the Maple Industry</P>

<P>"PORTSMOUTH, N.H., April 5, 2002 &ndash; A potent combination of warmer
temperatures, shorter winters, increasing drought, and the ravages of
forest-insect pests threaten to devastate the maple-syrup industry,
according to the Portsmouth-based nonprofit Clean Air-Cool Planet in a
recent testimony before the U.S. Senate Environment and Public Works Committee.</P>

<P>"The organization asserted that if the US doesn't act to reduce
greenhouse gases from burning fossil fuels, maple tree species are likely to
migrate out of New England, destroying an industry that brings more than
$100 million annually to the state of Vermont alone."</P>

<P>(((Come on.  Maple trees are not going to "migrate out of New England."
Trees don't walk.  The maple trees will die where they stand and be taken over by weeds.)))<BR>
<BR>
"Collectively, tree tappers in New England and New York gather and distill
approximately 75% of the maple syrup produced in the United States &ndash; a
$30 million contribution to the nation's economy annually.   ((Put it
on Enron's tab.  In the meanwhile, how about some genetically altered
cane syrup for those flapjacks?)))</P>

<P>"'Many of these sugaring families in New England have been careful
stewards of their maple trees for generations,' said CA-CP executive
director Adam Markham.  'It's up to our leaders in Washington to ensure that
climate change is halted and New England's unique maple products continue to
grace our family tables.'"  ((Yeah, and the Bush family have been careful
stewards of oil derricks for generations.  Let's see a maple farmer
raise enough money to be President.)))
</P>

<P>"New England is coming to the end of what will most likely be its warmest
winter on record, (((yes, yes  &lt;yawn&gt;))) with much of the region also in the grip of extreme drought since the end of last summer.  (((That drought
story's getting pretty good &ndash; New York City, Home of the War on Terror,
has a Greenhouse drought emergency.  New Jersey is especially hard hit.)))</P>

<P>"CA-CP says more frequent and longer dry periods along with earlier and
more unpredictable tapping seasons are a real threat to maple sugar
production. Sugar makers are reporting that the tapping season is starting
earlier and earlier, and are now regularly tapping as early as mid-February as</P>

<P>opposed to mid-March.   (((How can those maple farmers do that, and not
just shudder in dread?)))<BR>

"'Energy efficiency and alternative fuels such as wind and solar are the
real routes to energy security &ndash; not drilling in pristine wilderness areas,'
Markham told the committee.  'If greenhouse gases are not curbed quickly,
we may lose the sugar maple and much of New England's character with it.'"
(((Now name us some place on the surface of the planet that <STRONG>isn't</STRONG> 
going to lose its local vegetation and its character.  Go ahead, we'll wait till you find a place.  Your place, maybe?  Come on.)))</P>
