<P>Natalie Jeremijenko remarks:</P>

<P>"My robot dog adaptation pages:"</P>

and<br>
<A HREF="http://slowbot.com/hotdogs/" >http://slowbot.com/hotdogs/</A></P>

<p>"It's a project I have been working on for about a year
now, in typical no-funding way. The radioactivity dog is
done and being deployed in November in some post Chernobyl
fallout regions by a bunch of Norwegian highschool
students, fingercrossed. I have a few students working
this semester on the organic solvent and carbon monoxide
dogs.  It took me a year to convince my institution to let
me set these dogs on the students.</P>

<P>"Then you come in to invite hundreds, no thousands of well
paid, underworked corporate and anticorporate types to
jump all over the dog redesign game.... Or maybe to create
lots of interest/material/willing participants and dog
adaptation recruits.  Not sure if you are wiv me or agin
me!  Anyway, it is surprising how coincident you and I can
be. I thought I was secretly redeploying my feral robotic
dogs as secret agents.</P>

<P>"I think I will see you at Doors?  your co-conspirer, n"</P>

<P><b>(((Why yes Professor Jeremijenko, I will indeed be at
Doors of Perception this year.)))</b></P>

<h2>"The design challenge of pervasive computing<br>
14, 15, 16 November 2002 in Amsterdam</h2>

<h3>"Flow</h3>

<P>"'Everything flows' said Heraclitus. But we have filled our world with complex technical systems &ndash; on top of the natural systems that were already here, and
social/cultural ones that evolved over thousands of years &ndash; without thinking much about the consequences. Some of these consequences, as a result, include environmental
decline and poor social quality. So we need to start
thinking proactively about the design of complex systems and flows &ndash; particularly as we pervade the world with smart systems and ambient intelligence.</P>

<P>"We open the conference with a review of the natural,
human and industrial systems that we live among: how they
are doing? how they are interacting with each other? We
then explore the ways in which flows are a design issue.
What are the implications of a world filled with sensors
and actuators? What will it mean it to be 'always on' in a
real-time economy? To what question, is pervasive
computing an answer?</P>

<P>"In order to do things differently, we need to perceive
things differently. On Day 2 we therefore ask, how shall
we design ways to perceive, experience and understand
flows? What does the world as spreadsheet look like? How
do you design a global company&sup1;s 'dashboard'? Do we only
design visualizations of flows, or do we design for all
the senses, and experience flows through performance?</P>

<P>"On Day 3 we look at the design process in the space of flows &ndash; and what it means to move from designing things, to designing systems. When computers disappear, what then
will we design? How do we move from a project model, to a
continuous model of design? In what ways are games,
simulations and play appropriate modes of designing flows?</P>

<p>"The conference combines short, punchy presentations &ndash; by thirty thought-leaders from around the world - with panel discussions, and interactions among you, the participants. Flow Breakfasts for small special interest groups take place on Days 2 and 3.</P>

<h3>"Doors of Perception</h3>

<p>"Doors is a conference, website, knowledge network, and
cultural accelerator.</P>

<P>"We bring together innovators, entrepreneurs, educators, and designers who want to imagine alternative futures &ndash; sustainable ones &ndash; and take design steps to realize them.</p>

<P>"Doors brings together the actors and the thinking that
will influence social, cultural, technological and
theoretical design decisions in the years ahead. Design
decisions which are process decisions in a media and
network saturated environment, where the computer has
disappeared as visible technology. When the computer
disappears the environment becomes the interface. We might
understand this as a move from content management towards
context-management. Yet: what does it mean to manage the
design of context?</P>

<h3>"Speakers confirmed so far</h3>

<P>"The programme will feature 30 presenters together with
invited panellists, moderators, and you, the conference
participants.</P>

<P>"People are losing their jobs: how do I justify coming to
Doors?</P>

<P>"One reason we face economic problems now is that the
technology-driven model of innovation has failed. People
participate in Doors when they need to imagine sustainable 
and engaging futures &ndash; and take design steps to realize
 them. Doors helps people and organisations look at the
world in new ways. We explore next-generation service and
product concepts, and develop exploitable insights, tools,
and knowledge. Doors gives you a better understanding of
the design process, and will introduce you to scenarios
for services that meet emerging needs in new ways. You
will make new connections among innovative people and
organizations that you would never have met elsewhere."</P>
