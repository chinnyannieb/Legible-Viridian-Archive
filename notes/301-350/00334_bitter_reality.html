<h2>Entries in the Biofuture Robot Dog Contest:</h2>


<P>None.  We do, however, seem to be getting
a large number of web-hits on the contest page
from people who have never before been in a
Viridian Contest.  They want to know how to enter.</P>


<P>It works like this:
<p>

<OL type=A start=1 >
  <LI VALUE="1">
  You create your entry and put it
  on a website somewhere.  If you have no
  website and have no idea how to post
  things on the Web, forget about it,
  for you are not Viridian, you are already
  a d00med l0ser.
  <BR><BR></LI>

  <LI VALUE="2">
  You tell me, <A HREF="mailto:bruces@well.com" >bruces@well.com</A>,
  where the website is.
  <BR><BR></LI>

  <LI VALUE="3">
  I post the address to the Viridian List.
  <BR><BR></LI>

  <LI VALUE="4">
  The judges decide who wins.
  <BR><BR></LI>

  <LI VALUE="5">
  Eventually the entries end up in the
  Viridian Contest Repository.
  Go have a look at all the other
  contests.  Come on, you can
  beat those people, you newbies.
  Show some self-esteem here.</LI>

<h2>"Schroeder calls energy conference in Germany</h2>


<P>SOUTH AFRICA: September 3, 2002</P>

<P>"JOHANNESBURG &ndash; German Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder told
delegates at the Earth Summit yesterday Germany was ready
to host an international conference on renewable energy.
'I will send out invitations to an international
conference on renewable energy in Germany.
<p>

<P>"'We want to supplement what we achieved at the end of
last year at the Bonn water conference in the field of
energy,' he said in a speech to the World Summit on
Sustainable Development in Johannesburg.
<p>

<P>"He gave no further details of the meeting. Germany
organised an international fresh water conference in Bonn
last December, where delegates reiterated pledges to
provide adequate supplies of drinking water worldwide.
<p>

<P>"Schroeder referred to last month's dramatic flooding
in Germany, the Czech Republic, Austria and China. The
floods, which killed dozens in Europe and hundreds in
China, were blamed by some on global warming caused by
burning fossil fuels.
<p>

<P>"'Climate change is no longer a sceptical prognosis,
but a bitter reality. This challenge demands decisive
action from us,' Schroeder said.
<p>

<P>"He said the Earth Summit should pressure states to
ratify the Kyoto Protocol on climate as quickly as
possible so that it can come into force this year. He also
appealed to nations such as the United States, Canada and
Australia to make some contribution to climate
improvement.
<p>

<P>"'For those industrialised countries that have not
signed up, I appeal to them at least to contribute to an
equivalent reduction of greenhouse gases,' Schroeder said.
(...)</P>

<P><b>(((If climate change is "bitter reality" and getting
bitterer fast, are there still people in the denial
business?  Oh yes.  There's the Greening Earth Society, a
tool of American coal interests and a Viridian bete noire.
Note relentless political attacks on American public
figures admitting the truth.)))</b></P>

<h2>"VIRTUAL CLIMATE ALERT</h2>

<P>"August 29, 2002 Vol. 3, No. 26</P>

<P>"Maryland's outgoing Democratic governor Parris N.
Glendening, Tuesday, August 27th, announced mandatory
water restrictions across much of the state in response to
the major drought that grips mid-Atlantic states from
Georgia to Pennsylvania. The drought is so severe that
even with the rains of the last few days, many folks 'hope
for a hurricane' to deliver much-needed, prolonged, and
widespread soaking.</P>

<P>"But Glendening didn't stop there. Not satisfied with
articulating his government response to the drought, he
proclaimed its cause. Of course, it's global warming.</P>

<P>"What is curious to us is how Gov. Glendening apparently
is willing to link the drought to global warming while
scientists trained in climatology and meteorology and who
have dedicated their careers to a study of these fields
are reluctant (or lack sufficient political ambition) to
join him out on that limb. Here's why. <b>(((Because we pay
them to.)))</b></P>

<P>Read this Virtual Climate Alert in its entirety at
<A HREF="http://www.co2andclimate.org/Articles/2002/vca26.htm" >http://www.co2andclimate.org/Articles/2002/vca26.htm</A>.</P>

<h2>N.Y. Times to Facts: Drop Dead!</h2>

<P>"Maybe the heat prostrates dowager New York Times late in
the summer. Two years ago, it carried a breathless front
page story about the melting of the polar ice cap, only to
retract it a few weeks later (on page C-18) when
confronted with the historical record of polar
temperatures. <b>(((Uh, not really.)))</b> On August 28 of this
year, thanks in part to a dissonant convergence of climate
stories &ndash; drought in New York, yet another U.N.
environment confab, this time in Africa, evil President
Bush refusing to wreck our economy with the Kyoto Protocol
&ndash; the Times published a real lulu headlined 'Forecast for
the Future: Deluge and Drought.'"</P>

<P>"World Climate Report's editors walk through the facts of
the matter concerning frequency of severe European
flooding and trends in U.S. drought, and changes in the
rate of East Coast evapotranspiration and Asian rainfall.
You can read the entire story at
<A HREF="http://www.co2andclimate.org/climate/v8n01/feature.htm" >http://www.co2andclimate.org/climate/v8n01/feature.htm</A>.</P>


<h2>"Climate Model Lapse</h2>

<P>"The 'Great Debate' <b>(((there is no debate &ndash; there are
facts versus industrial interests)))</b> in climatology these
days focuses on the differences between two temperature
records: surface and satellite. The problem is this:
Thermometer readings from across the planet's surface are
warming at a greater rate than satellite temperature
measurements of the lower atmosphere, or troposphere. That
difference is probably real and not a result of errors in
the data sets, since the satellite record is a measure of
the temperature of the overlying atmosphere and not the
surface. Meteorologists call the difference between the
surface readings and those from the overlying atmosphere
the "lapse rate," a term that refers to the rate at which
temperature declines with height."</P>

<P>If climatologist don't understand the reason for the lapse
rate, are the climate models capable of winkling out the
answer? Read the facts of the matter
