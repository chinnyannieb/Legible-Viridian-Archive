</P>

<P>I have returned from Italy, where I was hanging out
with Linux free software guys.  Some of them were
Communists.  One always hears the weird allegation that
Linux users are Communists, but this is the first time I
ever met any real ones.
</P>

<P>In Italy's unique political circumstances, the
Communists are "the party of honest government."  Whereas
the current Prime Minister, Silvio "The Cavaliere"
Berlusconi, is a sinister media monopolist who hangs out
with half-reformed fascisti.  Then there's that Le Pen
guy, in France.  And in sweet, kindly Holland, a gay
right-wing xenophobe has been shot dead by an animal-
rightist.  You know, in Europe, life is hairy this season.
</P>

<P>People in Italy (who rather like cyberpunk books for
their spooky, noir aspects), always have me figured for
some kind of stiletto-toting, chrome and matte-black
conspirator.  Little knowing that the most sinister things
I do are (a) eating taco chips and (b) sitting in front of
a Macintosh moving my fingers up and down.
</P>

<P>This reputation, however, likely accounts for brief
Italian encounter I had with some Eastern European
cyberfeminists. It seems that these  ladies had read a
recent speech of mine at the Computers Freedom and Privacy
Conference, where I publicly stated that I "admire women"
and like to see them take "a public role in public life."
</P>

<P>They were thrilled to see a technologically
knowledgeable American male acknowledging their humanity.
These ladies have some security  problems.
</P>

<P>Mind you, these aren't heavy-duty, with-it, Cornelia
Sollfrank style cyberfeminists.  Those cyberfeminists are
sophisticated, learned Eurofemmes in brainy-glasses, who
hang out with Australian performance artists and know how
to use real computers.   These cyberfeminists were  dainty
little dissident peaceniks.  They're from one of those
"former" countries.
</P>

<P>These women would like to chat and share some files on
the Internet without having the secret police listening
in. Or, in fact, scary male guys of any kind, peering at
them as they let their hair down.
</P>

<P>Of course I was instantly suspicious of these women.
Those were probably ruthless Al Qaeda women. They were
merely disguised as harmless, bespectacled, Simone de
Beauvoir fans. Their high heels and surprisingly stylish
skirts were likely packed to the gunwales with suicide-
bomber gelignite.  I'm their dupe.  But so be it.
</P>

<P>Every time these poor girls meet in some Slavic
consciousness-raising circle, and cry in their coffee
about the terrible things that their hard-bitten mothers
told them about life when they were 14, doubtless there
should be a police spy there to make sure they don't
become nuisances.  I mean, I get it about that problem.
</P>

<P>As you know, we Viridians really like cops.  We rarely
mention feminists. Viridian List swarms with cops. We are
very aware of their pressing difficulties and
institutional interests.  Anything useful we Viridians can
do for you ladies and gentlemen in law enforcement, you
just let us know.  Really, no kidding.  A nice Viridian
Design Contest for classier SWAT riot-gear, we could
definitely get into that.
</P>

<P>But you know, archiving and data-mining every digital
emanation of civil society, that is not a legitimate cop
activity.  That's not "protecting and serving."  On the
contrary, that's malignant and repulsive, and it's a road
to general ruin.  My personal feeling is that &ndash; if some
antiterror police operation is somehow required against
feminists &ndash; then one ought to do it the <STRONG>good old
fashioned</STRONG> way.  None of this CARNIVORE or ECHELON
keywording nonsense.  Go get a <STRONG>female cop.</STRONG>   That would
surely work much better and quicker than spying on their
email, anyhow.
</P>

<P>Feminists always believe that any woman who can dress
like them, hang out with them, and learn their weird
deconstructive lingo must be passionately dedicated to
their Cause.  So then, once your female agent is in their
good graces, you can just round 'em up.  Feminists are
never much into hierarchy or operational discipline, so
they never divvy up into secure, conspiratorial cells.
You can just drop by the lesbian bookstore and toss 'em
all in the paddy-wagon.
</P>

<P>So much for the "threat," okay?  The very idea of goon
voyeurs spying on their personal email and Carnivoring
their pathetic little rusty PCs &ndash; well, it's just
overkill.  Anyone of decency has to bridle at this.
</P>

<P>So, I started in on 'em with the obligatory hacker-
guru pitch, all about encryption, and PGP, and ECHELON and
packet-sniffing and such, but I could quickly see that I
was losing them.  Their eyes were glazing over.  So I'm
afraid that I failed to satisfy their pressing needs and
requirements.  I felt bad about that, but that's not
really a Viridian problem.
</P>

<P>The Viridian aspect to the problem is this:  computer
security is <STRONG>ugly</STRONG>  and <STRONG>stupid-looking.</STRONG>  It's built by
master geeks who want to go head to head with the NSA.
It's all Cold-War-ish and stodgy and out-of-it.  What
Viridians would like best is some computer security that's
<STRONG>enticing</STRONG>, <STRONG>designery</STRONG> and even <STRONG>sexy.</STRONG>
</P>

<P>Encryption and computer security are very macho.
There's no such thing as <STRONG>pretty</STRONG> encryption.  The graphic
treatment of those programs, they're are all locks and
keys and bulldogs and portcullises.  They have the
Brobdingnagian look of castle keeps in Star Wars movies.
You know, those big ugly gates that weigh eighty tons and
reflect blaster fire, yet R2-D2 can always crack them in
15 seconds flat.
</P>

<P>What the likes of these feminists need is some form of
security they can use pretty much all the time, without
feeling all threatened and paranoid.  Much like, for
instance, their clothing.  Clothing is an anti-
surveillance device for women.  However, you rarely see
women choosing to wear plate armor.   Women are perfectly
aware of the exact level of inspection that their clothing
attracts or repels.  Women have this down to a literal
fine art.  Yet computer security  offers them no such
graces or subtleties.  You never know by the look of the
software if you're in a burqa or in lingerie. And it's
always ugly, and cumbersome, and threatening-looking, and
expensive, and hard to learn, and a paranoid drag.
</P>

<P>Feminists don't like to meet inside armed fortresses.
Eastern European feminists are very into areas like your
aunt's kitchen, where (a) nobody knows they are in there,
and (b) nobody much cares, and (c) no mere man would ever
believe that anything important could happen in there, and
(d) where everyone feels intimate and cozy, and (e)
there's coffee, and maybe some clean towels for people
having sudden emotional breakthroughs.  Nor are these
private, intimate places ever sponsored by the Oxygen
Network.  Malignant Tupperware ads should not be flying
through these spaces, assaulting the sobbing users with
commercial banner-spam.  These virtual communities
shouldn't  have the vibe of shopping malls, bunkers, or
death-traps.  They should just be sort of... invisible.
</P>

<P>So, I'm figuring... maybe something like password-
protected blogs.  With steganography.  Steganography I
take to be the most feminine form of computer security. It
merely looks like a pretty picture, while its depths are
unsuspected.  Any google-eyed web spider will just wisp
right over steganography; it's got a subtext hidden in
plain sight.
</P>

<P>So, ideally, you ought to quietly log in to your
hidden feminist blog, which looks very quiet and
undramatic, something like Virginia Woolf's "Mrs. Brown."
Instead of big screenfuls of naked data visible to every
prying eye, it ought to <STRONG>all</STRONG> be steganography in there.
All you see are big Mary Cassatt sentimental mother-and-
child JPEG and GIF files.  You can type a feminist
manifesto, or maybe some family-violence statistics, right
onto the picture, and it just <STRONG>soaks into the image and
quietly vanishes.</STRONG>
</P>

<P>Then, you could sort of glide over to the
confessional area, which is also just pictures: daisies,
seagulls, pubshots of Gloria Steinem....  And when you rub
at the picture with your mouse, some artless confession
flowers out, and you get to read it, and feel it really
deeply.
</P>

<P>If this were a better planet, I would have had all
that on a handy CD-ROM.  I should have just pulled that
out of my shoulder bag, handed it over and told them,
"This is what you ladies need.  Just press and play."
Man, I would have totally rocked their world.  They would
have told everybody they knew.
</P>

<P>Unfortunately, steganography seems to be in a
primitive state of development.  I can't even find a
method which is platform-independent &ndash; for instance,
there doesn't even seem to be a method of moving a stego'd
picture from a PC to a Mac or a Linux box.  The gals at
the battered women's shelter, they don't have enough money
to buy any dedicated crypto consoles.  They're gonna have
to manage with whatever they've got.  Which is very
haphazard and behind the times.
</P>

<P>In this Viridian imaginary product, this pretty,
beguiling security scheme, these women wouldn't be really
and truly safe and secure, of course.  If the lads and
ladies at Fort Meade ever decide to bring the full bore of
their zillion-dollar attention on you, you're toast.
Besides, these women are not safe and secure in their real
lives &ndash; because they come from still-smoking war zones
swarming with mafiosi.
</P>

<P>But at least they wouldn't be blundering into
increasingly dangerous areas of information warfare, where
they get mysteriously trapped and savaged by predators
with better hardware than they have, assailants they will
never be able to see, or confront, or shame into better
behavior.
</P>

<P>If you have any cogent tips, leads, or ideas on this
subject, let me know.  I'll be returning to Europe in
short order.  In fact, I'm going to Holland.  Rotterdam,
to be precise.  Sorry about the political violence there,
guys.  Times are tough all around.</P>
