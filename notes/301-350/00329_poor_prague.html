<p>"My entry is not bulletproof or even waterproof. I'd hope
people would have the sense to come in out of the rain. 
Or at least put the thing in a bag. Thanks for all the
work you do that you probably don't get paid for."</P>

<p class="head">
"PRAGUE'S 'FLOOD OF CENTURY' SAID TO BE WORST IN CITY'S HISTORY...</P>

<p>"Water levels continued to rise in Prague on 14 August
as Mayor Igor Nemec reported that the flow of the Vltava
River through the capital could no longer be gauged,
having exceeded the measurable limit of 5,000 cubic meters
per second, CTK reported.
</p>

<p>"During a flood in 1890, the rate reached 3,700 cubic
meters per second and was considered the highest in the
city's history. Experts also revised their forecast of
when levels in the city will peak, predicting on Czech
Television that the river will continue a gradual rise
into the evening of 14 August.
</p>

<p>"The city began the evacuation of additional downtown
areas, such as the historic Jewish Quarter and streets
around Old Town Square, in the early hours of 14 August.
</p>

<p>"Low-lying sections of the city are inundated and
metro lines are operating only outside the city center,
while all but one bridge over the Vltava are closed to
private vehicles. Gas and electricity supplies have also
been shut off to sections of the city as both major
distributors declared a state of emergency in some areas.
</p>

<p>"City police have refuted media reports of significant
looting in areas already evacuated or swamped, according
to CTK.  <b>(((Oh well, that's a mercy.)))</b> So far, more than
50,000 have been evacuated from their homes in Prague.
MS/AH</P>

<p class="h3">"...AS LARGEST CZECH EVACUATION SINCE WORLD WAR II
CONTINUES...
</p>

<p>"Interior Minister Stanislav Gross said on 13 August
that some 200,000 people have been evacuated throughout
the country, making the evacuation the largest since World
War II, CTK and international news agencies reported.
<b>(((Too bad that guy doesn't have a handy "Global Civil
Society" computer.)))</b>  Nine deaths have been reported in
the two weeks since the flooding began, including two
victims on 13 August, Czech media reported on 14 August.
</p>

<p>"Prime Minister Vladimir Spidla on 14 August commended
the country's emergency response, saying: 'Few people
realize just how little loss of life [there has been] and
how few injured people there have been.... What it means
is that decisions were made in time on evacuations.'
<b>(((How very advanced and first-world of you.
Congratulations.)))</b>
</p>

<p>"Damages are estimated so far at some $2 billion, but
Spidla said after a cabinet meeting on 13 August that the
extent of damages will only become known some 14 days
after the waters have receded. Spidla announced that the
government approved the state of emergency he declared one
day earlier in six of the country's regions and announced
that 380 million crowns (nearly $11.9 million) was
released for immediate aid. He said the parliamentary
Budget Committee will approve an additional 1.15
billion crowns by the end of the week. MS/AH</P>

<p>"...AMID MASSIVE RESCUE AND EMERGENCY EFFORTS. Some 4,000
policemen, 9,000 firemen, and 2,000 soldiers are battling
the effects of flooding in the Czech Republic,
particularly in the western part of the country, a
government spokeswoman told CTK on 14 August. <b>(((Why not
give them all the same uniform and rename them "Homeland
Security"?  After all, the evacuation's the biggest since
World War II.)))</b></P>

<p>"The hardest-hit major cities include Ceske Budejovice and
Plzen, <b>(((tough break, beer lovers)))</b> while scores of
smaller towns and villages have been devastated.</P>

<p>"Some 30 bridges have been swept away, according to the
daily 'Hospodarske noviny.' Foreign Minister Cyril Svoboda
added that offers of technical and financial assistance
have come in from Sweden, Poland, France, the United
States, Norway, Japan, Switzerland, Greece, Italy, and
other countries as well as NATO and the EU, according to
CTK the same day.  <b>(((Large areas of Asia and Africa also
felt pity, but have been reduced to states of savagery and
can't help much.)))</b>
</p>

<p>"The country will accept offers of assistance from
abroad, Svoboda added, stressing that Czechs particularly
need medicines, vaccines, and drying devices. <b>((("Drying
devices?")))</b>
</p>

<p>"President Vaclav Havel cut short a vacation in
Portugal and was expected to arrive in Prague in the
afternoon of 14 August and meet with Prime Minister
Spidla. MS/AH</P>

<p><b>(((This is the best part here &ndash; even their incredibly
juicy, ongoing political scandal got drowned.  It's become
a kind of "Underwatergate.")))</b></P>

<p>"INVESTIGATION OF FORMER CZECH FOREIGN MINISTRY OFFICIAL
ON HOLD DUE TO FLOODING. Investigators from the special
police squad conducting an investigation into charges of
corruption and serious economic crimes against Karel Srba
had to postpone questioning of witnesses because of the
floods, the daily 'Pravo,' cited by CTK, reported on
14 August.
</p>

<p>"A police official said the offices where the
investigation is being conducted had to be evacuated due
to the floods.
</p>

<p>"Srba is also under investigation on suspicion of
having commissioned the attempt to murder journalist
Sabina Slonkova and for the illegal possession of
firearms. <b>(((This scandal's really hot. This minister's
sexy femme fatale girlfriend wanted this snoopy female
journalist whacked, so they hired this tattooed hit man,
and...)))</b>
</p>

<p>"One of Srba's lawyers told 'Pravo' that two
executives from the Certos company, who have been charged
with bribing Srba and who are not in custody during the
investigation, informed the authorities they will not be
able to attend the investigation due to the floods.
</p>

<p>"Another Srba lawyer told the paper that one of the
two Certos officials, Jiri Sitar, has admitted that
5.5 million crowns ($172,160) of the 30 million crowns
confiscated by police during a search of Srba's house is
his money. Sitar reportedly said he 'just kept it there.'"
