<P>"The Wild Sloth Chase"</P>

<P>by Alex Steffen &lt;<A HREF="mailto:alex_steffen@yahoo.com">alex_steffen@yahoo.com</A>?&gt;</P>

<P>"My fellow Viridianistas,</P>

<P>"When the future arrived, most people weren't paying
attention.</P>

<P>"Most journalists are like me: easily distracted by
loud and shiny things. Few things in our recent
history have been as bright and well-hyped as the
e-commerce bubble. Now that it's over, it's easier to
see that the real heroes weren't building online
bookstores or virtual pet food empires.</P>

<P>"The 'Internet Boom' was a decidedly late-Twentieth
Century affair, with salesmen anxious to replace
craptacular brick-n'-mortar businesses with cyber-analogs.
For all their talk about building the world of tomorrow,
their most inspired idea for the Net was to make it
just like TV. Meanwhile, a whole 'nother group of
people were building structures that eat TV: think
Napster, think Slashdot, think blogs.</P>

<P>"If TV sucks, then global climate change truly blows. So
does the whole model of how we design and build the places
we live and the systems that power them. I want to find
the people who are inventing something to eat that model
of urban living.</P>

<P>"You must know who they are. Viridianismos is about
replacing the drab, ruined future we've been handed
with something dynamically sustainable, enticing
and weirdly brilliant. I want to find that shiny,
new-green future. I'm not exactly sure what it looks
like, but I'm going to spend the next half-year
traveling the United States, hunting it down. And I want
your help.</P>

<P>"Bruce Chatwin starts his travel book, 'In Patagonia,' by
describing the piece of dark and hairy dried-out giant
sloth hide that sat in his grandmother's cabinet.  Dreams
of finding a giant sloth drew him to South America. 'In
Patagonia' is not about giant sloths. But the giant sloth
pulls Chatwin along == sloth-sightings and rumors of
sloths drive the book.   In searching for the giant sloth,
he finds the real Patagonia.</P>

<P>"Here's what I ask of you: send me your giant sloths.
'The future is here,' as William Gibson says, 'it's just
not well-distributed yet.' Tell me where in your city (or
any city you know well) the Viridian future can be
found.</P>

<P>"What has the stink of the new on it? What art,
what architecture, which community groups, what design
innovations fill you with hope, awe you, give you
shivers? Where's the party? I have some great leads,
enough to convince a publisher to pay me to take this
trip. But I also know that 1,800 heads are better than
one.  Tracking the future is a team sport.</P>

<P>"This book may well become the world's first
network-supported travelogue. It's an experiment ==
and you get to play. Email me Viridian sloth sightings at
&lt;giantsloth(at)wildgreenyonder.net&gt;. Anyone whose
story is used in this book will get an author's copy,
handsomely personalized, directly out of my little stash.</P>

<P>"And, of course, you can follow my progress on this little
blog:</P>
