<P>"I whipped up a little entry for the dog contest.
I've had some downtime before I begin my new job,
so I've started a futurefeedforward novel.  I am also
the proud father of a newly built Linux system."</P>

<P>"Well, the competition is looking good...a little too
good, in fact.   I decided I'd better finish up now before
all the good ideas get published.
<BR></P>

<P>"I present to you Watson(tm), the complete companion-
building system from your friends at &lt;company as yet
unnamed&gt;<br>.  A mixture of tried-and-true technologies
and pure speculation.  But with the right financing...
crossing my fingers...  Duncan Stewart"</P>

<h2>"Newsletter of Metropolis Magazine 9/2002</h2>

<h3>"The Sustainable Metropolis</h3>

<P>"At the beginning of this section, we invite viewers to
submit their sustainably designed projects for use on our
site. We're looking for houses and office towers, as well
as thoughtfully designed chairs, tables, or other
furnishings == all emphasizing environmentalism and
creativity. Please send your sustainable project,
including jpegs and a list of green features, to
Metropolis at talk2us*metropolis.com.</P>

<P>"Here are two very different, yet equally important
submissions:</P>

<h3>"A Simple House in Washington, D.C.</h3>

<P>"My wife, Julie, is an environmental policy researcher and
I am a partner at istudiodesign, a Washington, D.C.-based
collaboration of architects, designers, and planners
dedicated to the design of livable, sustainable
communities. We chose this house, our first, for
sustainable reasons."</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.metropolismag.com/html/sustainable/simplehouse.html" >http://www.metropolismag.com/html/sustainable/simplehouse.html</A></P>

<h3>"Pharmacia Laboratory Building</h3>

<P>"Green features need to be planned from the very start of
a project, not simply added as an afterthought. A pre-
design charette, hosted by Bill Browning of the Rocky
Mountain Institute, was held off-site with Flad &amp;
Associates and other members of the design team, the
client, and the contractor. Careful use of sustainable
techniques and materials should save Pharmacia an
estimated $800,000 per year in energy costs."</P>
