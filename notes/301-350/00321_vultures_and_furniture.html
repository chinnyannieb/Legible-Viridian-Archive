<P><strong>Key concepts:</strong> Viridian commentary, Viridian furniture,
Viridian vultures</P>

<P><strong>Attention Conservation Notice:</strong>  Viridian Notes do
tend to get a little weird and whimsical when
we are running a design contest.  Almost 1,000
rambling words on totally unrelated topics.</P>

<P>Links:</P>

<P>We got slashdotted.
<A HREF="http://www.slashdot.com" >http://www.slashdot.com</A></P>

<P>The Pope's hometown is flooding.  The canoe house
at legendary Barton Springs, where I spent many
a happy hour for many a year, just washed downstream.
Aluminum canoes were crushed like beercans against the
bridge abutments.</P>

<P>"Yes, the diminutive SOON Global Civil Society palmtop
packs quite a  wallop for such a little and affordable
guy. Encased in a bio-degradeable, bullet-resistant
housing, waterproof to  100 meters and featuring the
industry's first commercially available  bio-luminescent
display, the SOON GCS palmtop is an activist's best
friend in a tight spot.</P>

<P>"Specs:<br>
* Dual 18.8GHz Transmeta N2 Processors<br>
* 16GB RAM Std. (expandable to 512GB)<br>
* 5" 1280X1024 Backlit, bio-Luminescent Display<br>
* Biodegradeable, bullet-resistant enclosure<br>
* Lithium-Fluorine Battery for 24+ hours battery life<br>
* Waterproof to 100 Meters<br>
* Voice and eye-tracking-controlled"</P><br>

World Economic Forum&gt;

<P>"To the attention of:<br>
Mr Bruce Sterling<br>
Science Fiction Author</P>

<P>"Dear Mr Sterling,</P>

<P>"Each year we nominate 100 Global Leaders for Tomorrow
(GLTs) under the age of 38 from all over the world with
backgrounds in politics, business and civil society. All
must already have achieved extraordinary success in their
professional endeavours and shown their commitment to the
mission of the World Economic Forum: Improving the State
of the World.</P>

<P>"We are now entering the final phase of the nomination
process for 2003 and highly encourage you to send us your
proposals for GLT candidates, together with the necessary
justification, by 31 August 2002 at weforum.org. Please
note that the nomination process is confidential.</P>

<P>"The 100 nominees will be invited to take part in the
special Global Leaders for Tomorrow Programme at the
Annual Meeting 2003 in Davos, Switzerland. Their fresh and
future-oriented outlook will enrich the discussions there.
They will also be integrated in the yearly Global Leaders
for Tomorrow Summit as well as in regional summits and
meetings, and other activities of the World Economic
Forum.</P>

<P>"The GLT community is active throughout the year. Its
projects and task forces aim to identify and address in
innovative and entrepreneurial ways some of the most
pressing global issues.</P>

<P>"I look forward to receiving your nominations for the GLT
class of 2003.</P>

<P>"With my best regards,</P>

<P>Klaus Schwab
Founder and President
World Economic Forum"</P>

<P>"Bruce,</P>

<P>"I have just moved to a new apartment and literally have no furniture aside
from a camping cot.</P>

<P>"How does a good little Viridian go about furnishing? What really
qualifies?</P>

<P>mindlace</P>

<P><strong>*Great question, mindlace!  I can sure tell you what <EM>I</EM> hanker for in 
the way
of furniture.   I want a green Humanscale "Freedom" office chair wth
matching little saddle stool, a magnesium "organic minimalist" Go chair by
Ross Lovegrove... just one, just to have it around... and oh, while you're at it,
why don't you throw in giant foam plastic Karim Rashid psychedelic
installation.  Oh, and some kind of rooftop 802.11 base so I can warchalk the
neighborhood.</strong></P>

<P><strong>Let's help this guy out, Viridians.  Send us some fun
places to shop for furniture online.  We're not going to
fuss about how "Viridian" they are, or at least, not right
away.  Because the guy's apartment is empty.  This is a
humanitarian crisis.</strong></P>

<P>Start here if you're into Danish zazen pillows and
handstitched hammocks made of nongassing organic Third
World rattan and all that:</P>

<P>Eighty-year-old "Modernism"?  Point click and ship!

<P>More candidates?  Let's hear about 'em.</P>
