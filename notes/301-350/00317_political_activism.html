<P>Subject: Big Win @ ExxonMobil!

<P>EXXONMOBIL SHAREHOLDERS SHOW GROWING CONCERN ABOUT
COMPANY'S LACK OF RENEWABLE ENERGY STRATEGY</P>

<P>Doubled Vote Total Boosts Efforts to Change ExxonMobil's
Isolation on Global Warming</P>

<P>DALLAS, TEXAS&ndash;May 29, 2002&ndash;Buoyed by growing support
from mainstream investors, religious shareholders
challenging ExxonMobil's position on global warming saw
record levels of support for their resolutions this
Wednesday. A resolution urging ExxonMobil to adopt a plan
for renewable energy resources garnered an impressive 20.3
percent of the vote, more than double the 8.9 percent vote
the same resolution achieved in 2001.</P>

<P>"Mainstream investors are questioning whether ExxonMobil
is really protecting shareholder value with its isolated
position on renewable energy and global warming," said
Peter Altman, national coordinator of Campaign ExxonMobil.
"For the first time mainstream investors are saying to
ExxonMobil that they need to see the rationale behind the
company's strategy: the 'just trust us and don't ask
questions' approach isn't going to work anymore."</P>

<P>(...)</P>

<P>"For too long ExxonMobil has refused to dialogue in a
meaningful way on this issue," said Reverend Michael
Crosby, the filer of the renewable energy resolution. "Now
the question becomes &ndash; how many investors will it take to
prod this company forward before it responds?"</P>

<P>(...)</P>

<P>"This is the year that the campaign against ExxonMobil on
global warming truly achieved critical mass," said Sister
Patricia Daly of the Tri-State Coalition for Responsible
Investment.  "We are now positioned as never before to
move out to bring new and important pressure on ExxonMobil
to face the facts about climate change.   I have never
been so encouraged about our prospects.  We expect to see
more new faces among institutional investors brought into
our ranks in 2003 and beyond."</P>

<P><BR>
(((Sounds great, eh? But check this out.
The Exxon-Mobil campaign suddenly finds
that the streets of Dallas are cram-full of rightwing
cranks who have been reading their email.  Welcome to
infowar, reverend.)))</P>

<P>'Global Capitalism' Foes Overwhelmed by
Counter-Demonstrators</P>

<P>May 29, 2002</P>

<P>Dallas (CNSNews.com) &ndash; Anti-corporate protesters at
ExxonMobil Corporation's annual shareholder meeting in
Dallas Wednesday packed up and left after finding
themselves outnumbered by free market demonstrators.</P>

<P>The anti-corporate protesters began arguing among
themselves about how best to deal with the large number of
free market demonstrators carrying banners such as "Yankee
Rent a Mob Go Home," "Capitalism Rocks" and "Greenpeace
Hates America." They quickly decided to pack up and leave.</P>

<P>"I think we rattled them. They're packing up their bags
and they're leaving," stated Niger Innis of the Congress
on (((sic))) Racial Equality, one of the free market groups
conducting a counter-demonstration. "Victory is sweet," he
added.</P>

friend of ExxonMobil

<BR></P>

<P>After determining that their message was not being
heard over the free market promoters, Scott Crow of the
group United People Resisting Oppression &amp; Racism (UPROR)
decided to call it a day.</P>

<P>Link: yes, they exist
<A HREF="http://www.uproarnow.org/" >http://www.uproarnow.org/</A></P>

<P>With a chant of "Gone for now,  but never forever," a woman in a "Proud to
be a Bohemian"  t-shirt retreated and other anti corporate protesters
began to leave.
<BR></P>

<P>"The [anti-corporate] protesters are anti-American and
anti-democracy, they are not just anti-ExxonMobil," stated
Peggy Venable, the Texas State Director for the free
market group Citizens for a Sound Economy (CSE.) "They had
anarchist training seminars this past weekend," she added.</P>


<P>Link: CSE, a big, hairy Beltway outfit that lacks anarchist seminars
<A HREF="http://www.cse.org/" >http://www.cse.org/</A></P>

<P>Venable said the ExxonMobil protesters are "shipped in
from elsewhere," while her group is from Texas. "We're
people that work for a living," she said.</P>

<P>Other counter-demonstrators shared the same view. "We
don't want environmentalists dictating the way we live,"
said Jose Muniz. "They want to reestablish socialism,
which is what died in Russia. They want to shove it down
our throats."</P>

<P>Carol Jones of the Texas branch of CSE carried a sign that
read "Hitler Held Mock Trials Too," referring to Tuesday
night's mock trial of ExxonMobil in which anti-corporate
demonstrators ruled the corporate giant "guilty" for
"crimes against humanity" and ordered the company's
charter revoked.</P>

<P>The free marketers also held up signs saying the
following: "Greens Suck," "Mother Nature Guilty of Climate
Change," "Get Back in Your SUV &amp; Drive Home," "Choose
Capitalism Over Eco-Socialism," "Stop Global Whining,"
"Oil Employs, Anarchy Destroys," "No Poor Man Passes Out
Jobs," "How Much Does Castro Pay You?" and "Greens are Red
at Heart."</P>

<P>One ExxonMobil opponent, who would only give his first
name, created a stir when he blamed the U.S. for the
terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, 2001.</P>

<P>"I understand why [terrorists] did it. America has
oppressed the rest of the world for 200 years or even
before that when they took the land from the Native
Americans and killed them, poisoned them and ran them off
their land," Luigi shouted over jeers from the counter-
demonstration.</P>

<P>Luigi also explained that "global capitalism is destroying
the environment and it's destroying the earth. It's
destroying the quality of life for everybody other than
the upper crusts who are reaping the benefits."  (((You
gotta love ol' Luigi, even if the "reporter" made him
up wholesale, which seems rather likely.)))</P>

<P>(...)</P>

<P>ExxonMobil chairman Lee Raymond told CNSNews.com that he
was unfazed by the protesters. "We operate in over 200
countries around the world and for some reason that is
bad," Raymond explained. He said ExxonMobil is a good
corporate citizen throughout the world, hiring citizens
from the countries in which it operates to satisfy 95
percent of its labor needs. (((Gosh, it certainly was
good of Chairman Raymond to meet the free press here.)))</P>

<P>"If that is what they mean by globalization, then frankly
everybody should support it," Raymond said.  (((Everybody
but the Bush Administration, which seems to have less
use for "globalization" than the Black Bloc.  No Kyoto,
no war crimes court, and pretty soon, no WTO.)))</P>
