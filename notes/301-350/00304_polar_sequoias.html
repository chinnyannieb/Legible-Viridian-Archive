<P>"Scientist probes fossil oddity: Giant redwoods near North
Pole</P>

<P>"Once upon a time, Axel Heilberg Island was a very strange
place. (((I am so there.)))
</P>

<P>"Located within the Arctic Circle north of mainland
Canada, a full 8/9ths of the way from the equator to the
North Pole, the uninhabited Canadian island is far enough
north to make Iceland look like a great spot for a winter
getaway, and today there's not much to it beyond miles of
rocks, ice, a few mosses, and many fossils.</P>

How one flies to the Pole to dig up trees, logistics-wise.
</P>

<P>"The fossils tell of a different era, though, an odd
time about 45 million years ago when Axel Heilberg, still
as close to the North Pole as it is now, was covered in a
forest of redwood-like trees known as metasequoias.</P>

(((The pitch about metasequoias.  They thought they were
all fossils, until one living species showed up in, where
else, China. It's now known as the "dawn redwood." So
we're launching headlong into <STRONG>Jurassic Park</STRONG> terrority
here... Canada melts and, on the soggy tundra, a swarm of
Viridian carbon-fixators plants <STRONG>newly-cloned ancient
polar sequoias</STRONG>...)))
</P>

<P>"Hope Jahren, an assistant professor of earth and
planetary sciences in the Krieger School of Arts and
Sciences at The Johns Hopkins University, recently
published results that partially demystified Axel
Heilberg's vanished forests.</P>

<P>(((Prof. Hope Jahren. A really cute, outdoorsy, polar
type. She's blinding me with science.  Makes you want to
bay right up a fossilized tree.  Okay, normally I refrain
from personal comments about distinguished paleobotanists.
No more.  I promise.)))
</P>

<P>"Jahren and colleague Leo Sternberg of the University
of Miami uncovered evidence that the Axel Heilberg's
forests probably received equatorial water and warmth from
a prehistoric weather pattern unlike anything in existence
today. (((Unlike any weather pattern <STRONG>so far,</STRONG> that is.)))
</P>

<P>"Other challenging mysteries remain, including how a
forest could develop given the sunlight it would receive
on Axel Heilberg. Because of its closeness to the North
Pole both now and in the time of the redwoods, Axel
Heilberg spends four months of each year in continuous
sunlight and four months of each year in continuous
darkness.
</P>

<P>"'We don't have plants that can survive under those
conditions today, let alone forests,' Jahren says. 'For a
tree to endure four months of daylight is like you or I
going without sleep for four months.'  (((Hey, great
soundbite.)))
</P>

<P>"Through a grant from the Andrew Mellon Foundation,
Jahren's research group has made three summer visits to
Axel Heilberg, excavating hundreds of fossil metasequoias.
The fossils are immaculately well-preserved.
</P>

<P>"'Some of this stuff looks about like driftwood on the
beach, but it's 45 million years old,' Jahren says. 'These
fossils are chemically preserved at a level you usually
would expect to see in something that's only 1,000 years
old.'  (((So where's the metasequoia lawn furniture?
Leave those teak forests alone.)))
</P>

<P>"That's ideal for Jahren, who studies the presence of
isotopes of elements like carbon, nitrogen and oxygen in
living and fossilized plants. (...) Jarhen, the winner of
last year's Geological Society of America Donath Medal for
most promising young scientist, studies the isotopes to
learn more about plants' relationship to weather and
climate change. In her group's first major Axel Heilberg
results, published in the January issue of the Geological
Society's 'GSA Today,' they measured the presence of
isotopes of oxygen and hydrogen in the fossilized
metasequoias.
</P>

<P>"'The wood of any tree growing anywhere records fairly
faithfully the oxygen and hydrogen chemistry of the water
the plant has access to through precipitation,' Jahren
explains. 'And there's a great deal of difference between
the chemistry of water that arrives at a certain location
after being transported [in evaporated form] great
distances over land versus the chemistry of water that
arrives at a place after being transported over water or
not being transported very far.'  (((Let me rephrase that,
without the brackets and polysyllables. "In the fossil
record, tropical rain looks plenty different from polar
rain. These dead trees lived on tropical rain in a polar
rain forest.")))
</P>

<P>"Jahren and co-author Sternberg chemically compared
the fossil isotope levels with those found in water in
contemporary precipitation patterns over great distances
of forested lands in the Amazon. They were able to show
that water traveling from near the equator almost due
north across the continents to the vicinity of Axel
Heilberg would have oxygen and hydrogen isotope signatures
that matched those found in the fossils.
</P>

<P>"While it might seem mind-boggling to have the equator
watering the north pole,  (((oh my God == please, don't
let me live to see that)))  Jahren notes that other major
climatological differences at the time included the lack
of a north polar ice cap. (((That's a sight I'm kind of
expecting &lt;groan&gt;.)))
</P>

<P>"'It's very hard to explain the isotope chemistry of
the precipitation using any other model of water
transport,' Jahren says. 'So we think we've basically
solved a piece of the puzzle.' (((Let's hope ol' Mr Nobel
comes knockin'.)))
</P>

<P>"As for the other major piece of the puzzle == survival
of the trees through extended periods of light and dark ==
Jahren's group is working to see if the isotope chemistry
of the fossils can help them learn how the metasequoias'
metabolism compared to those of contemporary plants. (((Oh
yeah. And where's the commercial app?   "Wow look!  I
found the polar gene sequence!  Now we can juice up that
Starlink corn!")))
</P>

<P>"'Did they function similarly to how plants function
now?' Jahren asks. 'Or did they have strategies that
plants either no longer have or no longer employ? (((and
will re-employ as soon as it pays Monsanto?)))  Were they
fundamentally different? These fossils are really forcing
us to expand our ideas of how ecosystems can work."</P>
