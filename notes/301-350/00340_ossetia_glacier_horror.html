<h2>"Hope fades for 80 missing in Russia mudslide</h2>

<P>"RUSSIA: September 24, 2002</P>

<P>"VLADIKAVKAZ &ndash; Rescue workers in southern Russia
scrambled over a vast black tongue of muddy ice and
rubble, as hopes faded for 80 people missing since a
glacier roared down a remote mountainside, engulfing
villages.
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"President Vladimir Putin said on television that a
third of the Maili glacier had broken free from the
Caucasus mountains late on Friday, causing a disaster
unlike any he could recall.  <b>(((Yeah: a glacier melts so
badly that a third of it, 20 million tons of ice, suddenly
breaks off and crushes everything in its path including a
film star. The galloping glacier was 500 feet high in
spots and moving at 60 miles an hour. That's pretty
memorable.)))</b>
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chunks of ice up to 100 metres (300 feet) thick
entombed the area around the village of Karmadon in North
Ossetia, a region on the northern edge of Russia's border
with Georgia.
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'The speed of the stream (of ice, mud and boulders)
was huge. There's no chance that any one in the area at
the time survived,' said Mikhail Razanov, deputy head of
the local Emergencies Ministry crisis unit told Interfax
news agency.  <b>(((Come to think of it, it must be pretty
demoralizing even to <STRONG>survive</STRONG> a "vast black tongue of
muddy ice and rubble" from a pursuing glacier.  Imagine
the post-traumatic stress, and the difficulties of a
successful explanation.  In other news, one 60-year-old
local man was found hiding safely in a cave.)))</b>
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(...) "Emergencies Minister Sergei Shoigu  <b>(((a great
name and title)))</b> warned that meltwaters posed a new
threat, noting the last kilometre (0.6 miles) of the ice
had an estimated volume of 10-11 million cubic metres
(350-388 million cu ft).  <b>(((So it's still merrily melting
away, then.)))</b>
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'If there is a sharp thaw, then we have to take steps
to evacuate people from the region who could be in the
disaster zone,' Russian news agencies quoted him as
saying.  <b>(((Well, at least they're not likely to re-settle
by other glaciers, because the planet is running out of
them.)))</b></P>

<P><BR>
<b>(((Here comes the weird part.)))</b></P>

<P>"Film Star Missing After Avalanche
MOSCOW, Sept. 24, 2002</P>

<P>"(AP) Sergei Bodrov Jr. first seized the attention of the
world's film fans in 'Prisoner of the Caucasus,' and those
mountains may have brought him doom as well as fame. The
actor, seen by many as a prime hope for post-Soviet
Russia's struggling movie industry, is missing after an
avalanche roared through the site where he was working on
his latest movie. <b>(((With any justice, this dead film
celebrity would become the long-sought "Rock Hudson of the
Greenhouse Effect," but well, you know, he's Russian.)))</b>
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Officials on Tuesday held out little hope that more
survivors would be found from the devastation wreaked when
some 20 million tons of ice broke off a glacier and roared
down a mountainside. Newspaper reports of the disaster
featured large photos of the 30-year-old actor-director,
whose roles combining eros, honor and bewilderment seemed
to synopsize Russia's ambitions and troubles. <b>(((Now he
personifies yet another Russian trouble: weather
violence.)))</b>
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The avalanche in North Ossetia, a region of towering
peaks high in the Caucasus Mountains, left as many as 150
people dead. Sergei Shoigu, Russia's minister of emergency
situations, arrived in the town, about 940 miles southeast
of Moscow, for a firsthand look. Local officials have
declared Thursday a day of mourning.
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In addition to recovering bodies, workers were
working to restore the road from the town of Gizel to the
village of Kaban, which has been left totally isolated as
a result of Friday's avalanche. About 3,000 people there
are relying on helicopter drops of food and there is no
drinking water.
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Some 300 rescue workers were in the area, but there
was no news early Tuesday of more survivors being found.
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Officials said 49 people from the film crew or local
support staff were missing, while nine were safe &ndash; seven
who were not with the others and two who got out of the
disaster area. <b>(((It's going to be tough for those two.)))</b>
Sergei Bodrov's father, a famous film director, and his
wife also arrived in North Ossetia on Tuesday with Shoigu.
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bodrov made his first movie in 1992, but it was four
years later that he riveted Russian and foreign viewers in
'Prisoner of the Caucasus,' which was directed by his
renowned father who now lives in the United States.
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The movie, based on Leo Tolstoy's novella of the same
title about two Russian soldiers taken hostage in
Chechnya, updated the tale to take place amid the war then
raging between Chechen separatists and the Russian army.
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Released in the United States as 'Prisoner of the
Mountains' &ndash; the title perhaps changed to avoid confusion
with a 1960s comedy that was one of the Soviet film
industry's most popular releases &ndash; was nominated for an
Academy Award and raised Russian cinephiles' hopes that
the industry was regaining its vigor after years of money
problems. <b>(((Too bad the headline isn't "Oscar Winner
Slain by Greenhouse Effect."  Close, but no such luck.)))</b>
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The next year saw those hopes fulfilled &ndash; and the
Caucasus connection continued &ndash; with the release of 'The
Brother.' Bodrov played a disillusioned Chechnya war
veteran who becomes a lone vigilante in the crime-
festering cities of Moscow and St. Petersburg. <b>(((Sounds
like prime video material for a viewing at the Viridian
Vatican.  Incidentally, we're having a party here on
Saturday the 28th.)))</b>   Audiences identified with the
antiheroic role of a killer with morals and ideals and
critics hailed it as the first true movie of 'the New
Russia.'
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bodrov's boyish looks, his full lips often set in a
tentative smile, seemed to emphasize the conflicting
currents of confusion and violence in the character.
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bodrov 'is, in a certain sense, an image of our time,
a hero of our time,' Nikita Mikhalkov, director of the
international hit 'Burnt by the Sun,' said Tuesday on
Russia's ORT television. <b>(((This may be the most famous
guy killed by the Greenhouse Effect.)))</b>
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In 1999, he appeared in the French-made 'East-West'
with Catherine Deneuve, <b>(((Oh what a near miss for
Catherine:  "Deneuve Crushed On Set By Glacier")))</b>
another Academy Award foreign film nominee and followed
that with 'The Brother 2,' which also got attention
internationally. His most recent foreign release was in
'Bear's Kiss,' again directed by his father, which
appeared at the prestigious Venice Film Festival this
summer.
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"He further boosted his popularity at home by hosting
the television show 'The Last Hero,' a reality-based show
similar to the U.S. 'Survivor.'  <b>(((Imagine if Sergei had
been one of the two out of 50 or so in his film crew who
<STRONG>survived.</STRONG>  What a publicity boom.  Wow.)))</b>
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bodrov wrote and directed 2001's 'Sisters' and was at
work on his second production as director/actor/writer
when the avalanche hit.
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda said the movie's
working title was 'Svyaznoi' (Liaison), about three men
from different social strata who are in love with the same
woman. Bodrov chose the grim role of a garbage collector
with artificial legs who dies at the film's end. <b>(((Only
in Russia, folks.)))</b>
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In a headline combining references to the film and
his TV fame, the newspaper on Tuesday wrote 'Mysterious
premonition of the famous actor: Hero Bodrov would have
died in new film.'
</p>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Bodrov and his wife Svetlana have two children, a 4-
year-old daughter and a son born in late August. <b>(((Sorry
Svetlana, sorry kids. Really, truly.  Maybe, someday soon,
the people will catch on.)))</b></P>
