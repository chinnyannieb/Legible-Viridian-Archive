<P><b>(((We Viridians spent a lot of time closely studying the
California energy crisis. Now one of its architects has
decided to turn states-evidence in a federal court.
Federal prosecutors will attempt to recast the fleecing of
California as one of the biggest corporate crimes in the
history of the known universe.  And they don't want just
Enron, one of the minor profiteers.  They're making noises
like they want to collar the lot of 'em.</b></P>

<P><b>(((Will justice be done?  Sure, you bet it will, Real Soon
Now. But before I delve at length into the latest dismal
developments, I wanted to say one thing that no other
pundit or commentator seems to be saying.  And that is:
Sorry.</b>
</p>

<P><b>(((Sorry, good people of California.  I feel true pity
and regret that you and your Golden State were ruthlessly
subjected to so much entirely unnecessary turbulence,
pain, monetary loss and bold fraud.  It's revolting to
recall how many people blamed it all on you, you and your
California-ness.   It's amazing to think that this gross
assault on your peace and dignity was so broadly and
lavishly spread across all of you, from the stricken widow
with no air conditioning to the factory-owner plagued with
brownouts.  You gentle, mystical people, what on earth did
you do to deserve such rough treatment? Nothing, nothing
except to dare to be vulnerable and a little careless.  I
just thought someone, somewhere should express real regret
about all this.)))</b></P>

<P>"For Enron's Belden, 'Success Bred Power'<br>
By Nancy Rivera Brooks and Nancy Vogel<br>
Times Staff Writers<br>
Posted October 18 2002
</p>

<P>"When Timothy N. Belden got out of college around 1990,
he found himself entering an arena that couldn't have been
sleepier.
</p>

<P>"He joined Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, a
research operation backed by the Energy Department, where
he was a utility policy analyst who wrote detailed studies
on the most arcane subjects.  <b>(((Tim was a science fed.)))</b>
Among the many reports he co-authored was the abstruse
'<a href="http://eetd.lbl.gov/EA/EMP/reports/34555.html">Theory and Practice of Decoupling</a>.'
</p>

<P>"A decade or so later, however, Belden found himself
in a very different world as head of Western electricity
trading for Enron Corp.
</p>

<P>"The Houston-based company was then the biggest and
most aggressive player in a field that had become
incredibly fast-paced and high-stakes in the wake of the
deregulation of energy markets in California and
elsewhere.
</p>

<P>"Along the way, Belden had evolved from an idealistic,
environmentally conscious policy wonk to the
quintessential Enron company man: smart, innovative and
aggressive.  <b>(((They were both.  That was the secret
behind all that divinely-inspired Enron arrogance.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"On Thursday, the 35-year-old Belden paid the price
for going too far with that aggressiveness. He pleaded
guilty to a single count of conspiracy to commit wire
fraud in connection with illicit trading tactics during
California's 2000-01 energy crisis.  <b>((("Wire fraud," boy
what a weird charge.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"'I did it because I was trying to maximize profit for
Enron,' Belden told a federal judge in San Francisco. He
agreed to cooperate in the continuing investigation and
pay back $2.1 million in ill-gotten gains.  <b>(((And to rat
out his pals.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"Those who've known Belden for a long time were left
trying to make sense of how a person they considered
supremely trustworthy had gotten caught up in a huge
corporate scandal.  <b>(((It didn't look like one at the
time.  Booming stock, owning a President... wow.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"'He's the most decent person I know in the whole
energy industry == bar none,' said Steve Stoft, an energy
consultant who hired Belden at the Lawrence Berkeley lab.
</p>

<P>"Stoft fondly remembered his friend's passion for the
environment, noting how Belden had once bought into a
windmill company 'because he wanted to invest in
alternative energy.'  <b>((("Alternative" is not a synonym
for "morally spotless.")))</b>
</p>

<P>"But as the years passed, and Belden abandoned his
life as a researcher to go to Portland General Electric
Co. and then Enron, he seemed to become interested in a
different sort of power: his own.
</p>

<P>"One energy consultant who worked with Enron in its
glory days remembers Belden as 'sufficiently smart and
sufficiently intimidating to call his own shots. In that
culture, success bred power.'</P>

<P><b>(((Fans of words-on-paper may like to further consult the
aptly titled "<a href="http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/158648138X/mirrorshades">PIPE DREAMS: Greed, Ego and the Death
of Enron</a>" by Robert Bryce, a nice guy I run into every
once in a while.)))</b>
<A HREF="http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2002-10-04/pols_feature.html">http://www.austinchronicle.com/issues/dispatch/2002-10-04/pols_feature.html</A>
</p>

<P>"At Enron, Belden was at the nerve center of a vast
operation that bought and sold electricity around the
clock. About 100 traders worked in constant activity under
Belden on the high-tech trading floor that Enron occupied
in the World Trade Center in Portland, Ore.  <b>(((Press the
F1 function key in Oregon and Californians swelter in the
heat!)))</b>
</p>

<P>"Deal after deal was lined up for the next month,
week, day == or even minute == with the Golden State's
official markets, the California Power Exchange and
California Independent System Operator, or with traders
from the dozens of other energy companies operating in the
West.  <b>(((Dozens of scared, shivering energy companies who
are staring longingly at the shredders.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"Belden and his lieutenants == some of whom now are
scrambling to cut their own plea agreements with
prosecutors == were particularly talented at playing one
market off another or at wringing payments out of Cal-ISO
to relieve congestion on the transmission grid, internal
Enron memos show. Frequently, Enron's traders created the
electron traffic jams they were then paid to fix, the
documents indicate.  <b>(((Now this vast human genius will be
devoted to surviving the American legal system.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"This year, a state Senate committee investigating
alleged energy market manipulation by Enron and other
companies received five compact discs containing Belden's
e-mails. (...) <b>(((Boy oh boy, not even Ollie North had
bulletproof email.)))</b></P>

<h3><b>(((Step B.  The Feds Publicly Gloat Over Their Stricken
Informant)))</b></h3>

<P>Source: Reuters</p>

<P>"WASHINGTON, Oct 17 (Reuters) == The following are
excerpts from a statement issued on Thursday by federal
prosecutors about a plea agreement with a former top Enron
Corp electricity trader:
</p>

<P>"The United States Attorney's Office for the Northern
District of California and the Enron Task Force announced
today that Timothy N. Belden, who was Enron's Chief Energy
Trader, has agreed to plead guilty to conspiracy to commit
wire fraud in a scheme with others at Enron Corp. to
manipulate California's energy market, a scheme that was
designed in part to alter the price of electricity in the
state."</P>

<P>Link:<br>
<A HREF="http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/can/press/html/2002_10_17_belden.html">http://www.usdoj.gov/usao/can/press/html/2002_10_17_belden.html</A>
</p>

<P>"In the first criminal charges to be filed in an
investigation of the manipulation of the California energy
markets during the power crisis of 2000 to 2001, Enron's
chief energy trader was charged in San Francisco federal
court with one count of conspiracy to commit wire fraud.
</p>

<P>"The defendant has agreed to plead guilty and
cooperate with the United States in its investigation.
</p>

<P>"The charges are based on Enron's intentional
manipulation of the California energy markets, which was
done in part to affect the price of electricity in
California. In pleading guilty, the defendant will admit
that Enron's manipulation of the California energy markets
was illegal.  <b>(((Like Tim's the supreme expert on the
subject. Like that was all his doing.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"The investigation is being led by the U.S. Attorney's
Office in San Francisco, the Enron Task Force, the
Antitrust and Fraud Divisions of the Department of
Justice, and the San Francisco division of the FBI.
<b>(((Incredible that the FBI has allowed themselves
to be listed <STRONG>last,</STRONG> for once.  Maybe they've learned
some humility lately.)))</b></P>

<A NAME="_enron_revenues_soared"> </A>
<H3>"ENRON REVENUES SOARED</H3>

<P>"Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson, the head of
the Justice Department's Corporate Fraud Task Force, said,
'During the period of the charged conspiracy, Enron's
revenues from Belden's trading unit rose from $50 million
in 1999 to $500 million in 2000 to $800 million in 2001.
While Enron benefitted from the overall rise in
electricity prices, the information charges that a portion
of these increased revenues was due to the execution of
these schemes. The conspiracy charged in this information
allowed Enron to exploit and intensify the California
energy crisis and prey on energy consumers at their most
vulnerable moment.'
</p>

<P>"U.S. Attorney Kevin V. Ryan, a member of the
Corporate Fraud Task Force, said in announcing the guilty
plea, 'These charges answer the question that has long
troubled California consumers: whether the energy crisis
was spurred in part by criminal activity. The answer is a
resounding yes. The U.S. Attorney's Office in San
Francisco and the Justice Department will bring to justice
those who served their own selfish purposes by
intentionally and criminally manipulating energy consumers
in California and on the West Coast.' (...) <b>(((Yeah, all
three of 'em, including this geeky Enron science wonk.
Well, we'll see.  Enron was by no means one of the major
profiteers in California.  They just have the most cops on
their case and the least number of surviving defense
lawyers.)))</b></P>

<A NAME="_power_price_rise_linked_to_trader"> </A>
<H3>"POWER PRICE RISE LINKED TO TRADER</H3>

<P>"The Information alleges that in 1999, Enron's West
Power generated approximately $50 million in revenues. By
2001, West Power's revenues increased to approximately
$800 million as the price of electricity skyrocketed.
</p>

<P>"Prices during the height of the energy crisis rose
from $25 per megawatt hour to, in some cases, $1,500 per
megawatt hour. It is alleged that the price increase is
attributable in part to the schemes charged in the
Information.
</p>

<P>"In pleading guilty, Mr. Belden will admit that
beginning in approximately 1998, and continuing through
2001, he and other individuals at Enron conspired to
manipulate the energy markets in California by:</P>

<P>"* misrepresenting the nature and amount of electricity
Enron proposed to supply in the California market, as well
as the load it intended to serve;</P>

<P>"* creating false congestion and falsely relieving that
congestion on California transmission lines, and otherwise
manipulating fees it would receive for relieving
congestion;</P>

<P>"* misrepresenting that energy was from out-of-state to
avoid federally approved price caps, when in fact, the
energy it was selling was from the State of California and
had been exported and re-imported;</P>

<P>"* falsely represented that Enron intended to supply
energy and ancillary services it did not in fact have and
did not intend to supply.
</p>

<P>"As a result of these false schedules, Mr. Belden will
admit that he and his co-conspirators were able to
manipulate prices in certain markets, arbitrage price
differences between the markets, obtain 'congestion
management' payments in excess of what they would have
received with accurate schedules, and receive prices for
electricity above price caps set by the California
Independent System Operator ('ISO') and the Federal Energy
Regulatory Commission.  <b>(((This sure makes you wonder why
anybody anywhere thinks that things get more honest when
they're all automated and computerized.  "Looka this
'Congestion/Decongestion' switch!  Every time I pull it,
they pay me!")))</b></P>

<h2>"Energy industry's dirty little details about to see light</h2>

<P>by David Lazarus
Sunday, October 20, 2002
</p>

<P>"The betting in energy circles is that Enron's
erstwhile big cheeses are in deep trouble now that the
company's former top trader has pleaded guilty to
manipulating the California power market.
</p>

<P>"But that may not be the half of it.
</p>

<P>"Sources close to the matter say Timothy Belden, who
previously ran Enron's trading office in Portland, Ore.,
is prepared to implicate a number of other industry
players in what could shape up to be one of the biggest
conspiracies in U.S. corporate history.
</p>

<P>"Deputy Attorney General Larry Thompson declined at a
news conference last week to identify other alleged
conspirators in the fleecing of California ratepayers.
<b>(((Oh, hey, I can do that. 'Cause we Viridians were
watching. "The leading power generators for California
include Reliant Energy, El Paso Energy Corp., Dynegy and
Enron Corp., all of Houston; as well as Duke Energy Corp.
of Charlotte, N.C.; AES Corp. of Arlington, Va.; Southern
Co. of Atlanta; and Calpine Corp. of San Jose.")))</b>
</p>

<P>"But he did say that 'Belden and others conspired to
defraud California electricity consumers and customers.'
</p>

<P>"This confirms a lot of hunches here in the Golden
State, where folks knew something was screwy with the
power grid long before federal authorities finally decided
to weigh in on the matter.
</p>

<P>"Now we know exactly how it was done, at least as far
as Enron was concerned.
</p>

<P>"Belden said he and his cronies would provide bogus
data on how much juice was available at any given time to
state utilities.
</p>

<P>"This would create the impression of congestion on
power lines when none in fact existed, driving up demand
and, better still, allowing Enron to charge an extra fee
to relieve the congestion that wasn't actually there in
the first place.
</p>

<P>"Enron also exported power generated in California to
other states and then turned around and sold it back to us
at a big markup as electricity generated elsewhere.
</p>

<P>"Chutzpah? These people were rewriting the definition.
(...)
</p>

<P>"The question now, aside from which former Enron
bigwig will be in court next, is whether the other major
players in the energy business were running similar scams.
</p>

<P>"Sources in a good position to know tell me that
Belden is cooperating fully with investigators and is
prepared to map out a far-reaching scheme involving all
the big boys.
</p>

<P>"'We intend to pursue this investigation wherever it
leads,' Kevin Ryan, U.S.  attorney for the Northern
District of California, told reporters Friday. 'Mr.
Belden's co-conspirators == and they know who they are ==
should be very concerned."
</p>

<P>"Maybe they are already.
</p>

<P>"I'm told that last week's resignation of Dynegy
President Steve Bergstrom was directly related to the
looming prospect of Belden naming names. Dynegy also said
it will exit the energy-trading business.
</p>

<P>"Dynegy is being investigated by the Justice
Department and already has agreed to pay $3 million to the
Securities and Exchange Commission to settle fraud
charges. <b>(((Dynegy almost bought Enron when Enron was
crippled.  Now the black hole's got both of them.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"A spokesman for the company, David Byford, denied
that Bergstrom's decision to step down was tied in any way
to Belden's case. On the other hand, Bergstrom came to
power as a result of his success building up Dynegy's
energy-trading operation.
</p>

<P>"For what it's worth, San Francisco's ChevronTexaco
owns about 26.5 percent of Dynegy and is the Houston
firm's largest shareholder. <b>(((Man, if only an oil-major
like ChevronTexaco got indicted for this solemn fraud
and... oh well, keep dreaming.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"Dynegy and other industry leaders have already said
they played no role in exacerbating California's power
woes. Enron said the same once upon a time.
</p>

<P>"Clearly we haven't heard the end of this."</P>
