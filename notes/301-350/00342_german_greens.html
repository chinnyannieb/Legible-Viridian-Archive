<P>"All of the colors seen on the squashes in our native gardens were to be
found on the dogs we had in the old times. They were yellow-chested,
spotted, brown and of other colors...Icta-Dopac or Eyes-Four. This we
may translate as Four-eyes. This dog was so called because he had small
dark spots over the eyes that made him look as if he had four eyes. He
was very gentle.   Hidatsa Wolf-Chief, 1913."</P>

<h2>"Victorious German Greens mix eco-aims with realism</h2>

<P>"GERMANY: September 25, 2002</P>

<P>"BERLIN == Germany's Greens pledged this week to push ecological issues to
the fore after a late surge in support gave them their best ever general
election result and saved Germany's centre-left government.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"However, Joschka Fischer, the foreign minister and 
architect of their
electoral triumph, promised the Greens would not 'flex their muscles',
implying he would continue to shepherd the party along a path of
compromise.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Greens leaders met this week after the party had 
increased its share of
the vote by almost two points to 8.6 percent from 6.7 four years ago, to
prepare for fresh coalition negotiations with Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder's
Social Democrats.   (...)
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Analysts said this meant a sharper focus on 
environmentally friendly
transport, sustainable farming and renewable energy as well as a possible
rise of energy tax.   (...) But there was no escaping the fact that much of
Greens' triumph was due to Fischer, the revolutionary-turned-realist whose
personal charisma the party traded on ruthlessly.  <b>((("Ruthlessly"?  Joschka
is Germany's most popular politician.  He's ruthlessly beloved.)))</b>
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(...)  "Four years on, the party's election manifesto was 
vaguer than in
1998, with no proposed new rate of energy tax or plans to cut motorway
speed limits.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"But they still surpassed their eight percent 
pre-election target to
remain Germany's third political force, and in power.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"They also won their first outright constituency seat 
through anti-war
campaigner Christian Stroebele, who drove a small electric car throughout
his campaign.  <b>(((Beep-beep!)))</b>
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Companies with an environmental edge saw their stocks 
gain after the
Greens' success. The wind power specialist Plambeck shot up 15 percent in
Frankfurt, while the green energy firm Umweltkontor rose 3.3 percent.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In Oslo, the Norwegian bottle and can recycling group 
Tomra opened 12
percent higher on hopes of wider recycling in Germany after the election, but
later fell back."  Story by Philip Blenkinsop</P>

<P><b>(((Maybe one <STRONG>should</STRONG> change one's vote after watching one's
home wash away.)))</b></P>

<h2>"Environment Becomes a Political Football in Germany</h2>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"With half of Germany submerged under water and elections 
looming, the
environment has suddenly taken on a new urgency in the political campaign.
Has the Green Party found a new weapon against the conservative
opposition?
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The storms that have wreaked havoc in southern and 
eastern Germany
this past week have presented an unintended political opportunity for
Chancellor Gerhard Schroeder&sup1;s government coallition.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Lagging behind the Christian Democratic Union and 
Chrisitian Social Union
in the polls before the Sept. 22 elections, Schroeder's social democratic and
Green party coalition government has used the flooding to tout their
environmental record and attack the Union&sup1;s lack of an environmental vision.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The Greens took special issue with chancellor candidate 
Edmund
Stoiber&sup1;s failure to appoint a person responsible for environmental affairs in
his much-publicised shadow cabinet.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'In the face of the ongoing natural catastrophe, 
candidate Stoiber should
reflect on why nobody in his so-called competence team is responsible for
the environment,' Green Foreign Minister Joschka Fischer told the Thuringer
Allgemeine newspaper on Tuesday. 'Precisely in Stoiber&sup1;s Bavaria, there was
unchecked construction in the flooded areas.'  <b>(((Ouch!)))</b> (...)
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The environmental spokesperson of the Greens, Reinhard 
Loske accused
Stoiber of 'environmental ignorance'.  In a statement he said, 'those such as
the union who want to end the eco tax and reject the further expansion of
renewable energies, are dealing in an utter irresponsible manner'.  <b>(((Yeah,
but who cares? We're rich businessmen!)))</b>
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The so-called 'eco tax' is considered by advocates to be 
one of the great
achievements of Schroeder's coalition government since it came to power in
1998. The tax, placed on everything from fuel to electricity, is meant to
spur conservation by gradually increasing the cost of energy and raw
materials, kick-start investment aimed at energy conservation and generate
revenues to bring down labour costs."  <b>(((Sounds pretty "responsible" to me.
Too bad it's political suicide everywhere but Germany and far from a majority
taste even there.)))</b>
(...)
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Both proposals have come under heavy criticism by 
industry leaders and
opposition parties.  Business leaders felt the eco tax would scare away
consumers fearing higher electricity bills and rising gasoline costs. 
Opposition parties have maintained that nuclear energy is the most
inexpensive form of energy currently available. <b>(((Except for that
ultra-expensive nuclear garbage.  As for fossil fuels, well, who pays for
those storms and floods? Voters.)))</b>
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Meanwhile, as floods wreak havoc and claim lives in 
large regions of
southern and eastern Germany == particularly in Saxony, Saxony Anhalt and
Bavaria == both Chancellor Schroeder and his conservative challenger,
Stoiber have rushed to the worst-affected cities of Dresden and Passau in
Bavaria respectively."</P>

<h2>"Wanted: Loads of Clean Energy</h2>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"As unprecedented rains lash Germany, the debate on 
climate change and
renewable sources of energy has become increasingly vocal. Here a look at
which regenerative energies play a role in Germany&sup1;s energy market.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"While environmentalists and scientists world-wide debate 
the origins of
global warming and its effects on the world's climate, <b>(((no they don't
"debate the origins" == they just point out stark facts to powers-that-be and
then contemplate suicide)))</b> one fact remains undisputed == people all over
the globe are consuming more and more energy daily.  <b>(((No they're not.)))</b>
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It's still unclear to what extent rising levels of 
energy consumption are
responsible for climatic change. But the latest weather catastrophes in
Europe have triggered a debate in Germany about moving away from fossil
fuels and towards the use of alternative sources of energy.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In 1999 Germany renounced the use of nuclear power == 
which accounts
for 30 percent of its energy consumption. The governing Social Democratic-
Green coalition considers nuclear power and the disposal of radioactive waste
too dangerous.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Germany moves towards regenerative energy
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The country has made efforts to move away from polluting 
fossil fuels
and embrace alternative energies, in particular solar power. At present, 7
percent of Germany's electricity is generated using alternative energy
sources.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After the passing of the Renewable Energies Law in April 
2000 that
sought to encourage a switch to renewable energies, Germany experienced a
sort of solar boom. The southwestern city of Freiburg boasts the first hotel
in Europe run entirely on alternative energy sources. But despite the solar
push, power from the sun today provides a mere 0.0006 percent of
Germany's electricity.</P>

<h3>"Wind and water</h3>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Another popular source of alternative energy in Germany 
is hydroelectric
power, which makes up more than half of alternative energy segment in the
country. But experts believe that hydroelectric power (photo) is pushing its
limits and has already exhausted 80 percent of its potential.
</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"It has also become increasingly difficult to find large 
rivers in which to
set up generators without the ecology of the region being adversely
affected."(...) <b>(((Especially when rivers and lakes flood catastrophically from
climate change.)))</b></P>
