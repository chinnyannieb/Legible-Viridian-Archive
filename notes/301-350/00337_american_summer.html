<P>"Here is my entry for the Biofutures robodog contest.
These few words sum up the principles of my ideas.
i thought i would send it in now as you don't seem to be
having many entries yet (sure they will come along though).
Yes i want one of my robodogs for my son...
thanks mark"</P>

<P>This contest ends September 30, 2002.  That's less
than two weeks!  How hard can a fake dog be?</P>

<h2>"US summer of 2002 is hottest since 1930s Dust Bowl</h2>

<h3>"USA: September 16, 2002</h3>

<P>"WASHINGTON == With nearly half the country reeling from a
blistering drought, this summer is the hottest since the
depression-stricken 'Dust Bowl' era of the 1930s, U.S.
government weather experts said last week.
</p>

<P>"The summer's scorching temperatures have sparked
raging forest fires in the West, wilted crops in the
Midwest and parched pastures in the Plains.
</p>

<P>"The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration
said the average temperature for the contiguous United
States from June through August was 73.9 degrees (23.3
degrees Celsius), the third hottest summer since records
began in 1895. Summer officially ends on Sept. 22.
</p>

<P>"The only summers warmer were 1936 and 1934, when vast
numbers of farmers were driven from their land by drought.
</p>

<P>"'It's very extraordinary to have the warmest summer
since the 1930s Dust Bowl days,' said Douglas LeComte,
drought specialist for NOAA's Climate Prediction Center.
<b>(((I suppose he feels he has to say that, but surely it's
not surprising him much.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"Although the U.S. economy is no longer as dependent
on agriculture as it was in the 1930s, a major drought two
years ago caused damage worth $4 billion and claimed 140
lives nationwide. That summer in 2000 was only the 12th
warmest on record.
</p>

<P>"'Although the total costs of this year's drought are
not presently known, the drought-diminished water
supplies... and contributed to an active wildfire season
and extremely difficult farming conditions,' NOAA said.
</p>

<P>"Moderate to extreme drought covers more than 45
percent of the United States.</P>

<h3>"UNPRECEDENTED DROUGHT IN 6 STATES
</h3>

<P>"Six states == North Carolina, Virginia, Colorado,
Utah, Arizona and Nevada == are suffering their worst
drought on record, NOAA said. South Carolina, Maryland,
Georgia, Delaware and Wyoming are also near unprecedented
dry levels.
</p>

<P>"The prolonged drought has scorched U.S. wheat, corn
and soybean crops, which will be the smallest in years.
More than 50 percent of pastures were classified as poor
to very poor in 24 states, leaving ranchers with little to
feed their livestock.
</p>

<P>"So far this year, South Dakota officials have
reported over $1.8 billion in agricultural losses, while
Texas claims $316 million in damages. Costs to fight
forest blazes this year are expected to amount to more
than $1.25 billion, government officials said.  <b>(((As the
forests decline from heat stress and booming pest
populations, Americans will finally be persuaded that it
makes good sense to log our national forests down to
bedrock if they are going to burn up anyway.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"'NOAA officials predicted the direct loss of this
year's drought would certainly be in the billions of
dollars.  (...)
</p>

<P>"The Democratic-led U.S. Senate on Tuesday voted
overwhelmingly to provide drought relief of $6 billion to
farmers and ranchers despite objections from the Bush
administration.
</p>

<P>"The most extensive national drought in the past 100
years was in 1934 when it hit 80 percent of the country.
Studying tree ring records, NOAA researchers said the
severity of the 1930s drought was likely surpassed only in
the 1570s and 1580s."  <b>(((Well, there's a record to look
forward to.)))</b></P>
