<BR>
<BR>
<BR></span></p>

<p><span class="Default">"Trusted systems" are a hot topic this season, given
that the Internet is swarming with spammers and Microsoft
viruses, and maybe one or two terrorists.  Who better to
solve this Microsoft problem than Microsoft? Except they
probably won't.
<BR></span></p>

<p><span class="Default">As you can see from the resentful, gushing acrimony
in the many links above, Microsoft plans to wire itself
permanently into the substructure of the planetary
operating system. "Palladium"  might not be all that bad a
scheme if it had any democratic political legitimacy
deriving from the consent of the governed.  But, alas, it
doesn't.  Nobody's even considering that approach.
<BR></span></p>

<p><span class="Default">One needs to look at this particular design problem
from a global perspective. Why would any sane computer
user (even an American), trust the "trusted system" of a
ruthless commercial monopoly with such a long history of
abusive practices?  One might well be <STRONG>forced</STRONG> to do such
a thing at the point of a bayonet or a search warrant.
But how much "trust" does that involve?
<BR></span></p>


<p><span class="Default">Then there's the spy and dirty-tricks angle, always a
show-stopper for American-dictated networking solutions.
If trusted Microsoft is not writing in nice large trusted
doors for the trusted FBI and trusted NSA, then they're
not very patriotic.  If they <STRONG>are</STRONG> wiring-in the FBI and
NSA, then they have the same basic problem as the long-
forgotten Clipper Chip.
<BR></span></p>

<p><span class="Default">Frankly, it's just bonkers for any French, German or
Chinese person, or, really, any human being, to use a
device which is so transparently  designed as an asset for
American espionage.  You are supposed to <STRONG>hide</STRONG> UK/USA
Echelon, and all the rest of that stuff.  It's <STRONG>secret</STRONG>,
that's why it's called "espionage."  You can't just slop
espionage like pork-and-beans onto a paper plate and
expect everybody to swallow it.  Even the British will
balk.</span></p>

<BR></span></p>

<p><span class="Default">So, we have a serious social, political and economic
problem here. However, a Viridian solution beckons.  What
we need is a <STRONG>genuinely</STRONG> trustable, cheap, well-designed,
rugged, sexy, accessible computer system that is owned,
manufactured and operated for, well, Global Civil Society.
<BR></span></p>

<p><span class="Default">This machine shouldn't be some commercial for-profit
business gizmo which has been wrenched over (unwillingly
and kicking all the way) to some few of the many noble
purposes of citizenship and global democracy.  This
computer needs to be a <STRONG>primarily</STRONG> political and social
computer.  When you open it up, it shouldn't display the
creepy logo and suspicious agenda of "Microsoft, Compaq,
HP, IBM, Intel" or any of those "trusted computing"
jaspers.  It shouldn't even say "USA," "France,"
"Germany," "G-8", "U.N.," or "NATO" == it shouldn't say
anything, really, except "Global Civil Society."  Think
globally, act globally!
<BR></span></p>

<p><span class="Default">And none of this shady ICANN nonsense, either.</span></p>

<p><span class="SubHead">Link:<br>

<BR></span></p>

<p><span class="Default">The software and communications protocols in this
device should be transparent. Honest. Aboveboard.  Public.
Public-spirited. Fair. Inclusive. Multi-culti. Legitimate.
This Is What Democracy Looks Like.  All that stuff that
computer hardware and software never, ever is.
<BR></span></p>
<a name="globalcontest" id="globalcontest"></a>
<p><span class="Default">Thus, our latest Viridian Design Contest: the Global
Civil Society Design Contest.
<BR></span></p>

<p><span class="Default">As longtime slashdot readers, we know perfectly well
that the mere 1,750 people (and counting) on Viridian List
can't possibly build a global computer operating system
fully suitable for human rights orgs.  Therefore, what we
want from you is a <STRONG>Viridian Imaginary Product</STRONG>.  It's the
<STRONG>graphic screenshot</STRONG> of such a system.  Imagine what  that
device might look like, and what it might do. Then show
that to us by putting it up on the web and emailing the
web address to the Pope-Emperor, <A HREF="mailto:bruces@well.com" >bruces@well.com</A>.  We will
place your entry onto our customary websites.</span></p>

<BR>
<BR></span></p>

<p><span class="Default">Here's the basic pitch.  Let's imagine you are Joe or
Juanita Global-Civ. There you are, a selfless, activist
policy-wonk, one civilized soul in a darkening world where
ethnic throat-cutting is rising sharply and trust in the
biz community has plummeted.
<BR></span></p>

<p><span class="Default">You're at Rio, eloquently moaning over the dead coral
reefs. You're at the WTO and you brought a rational
argument.  You're cataloging landmines in the Balkans or
Kashmir, you're logging-on in Alternet and Indymedia,
you're the daring token feminist at the Kabul loya
jirga....
<BR></span></p>

<p><span class="Default">Then, in that classic wonk moment, you pull your
Global Civil Society Designer Laptop from your ballistic-
nylon shoulder bag and you boot it up.  "Whoa!" is the
instant response from a stunned and impressed public.
"Where'd you get <STRONG>that</STRONG>?"
<BR></span></p>

<p><span class="Default">"Oh, this?  We've <STRONG>all</STRONG> got these now!  They're
<STRONG>everywhere!</STRONG>"
<BR></span></p>

<p><span class="Default">That's our conceptual victory condition.  Now here are
some operational details.
<BR></span></p>

<p><span class="Default">I will not be judging this design contest.  I am
judging another design contest run by somebody else.</span></p>

<p><span class="Default">Link:
<A HREF="http://www.the5k.org" >http://www.the5k.org</A>
<BR></span></p>

<p><span class="Default">Instead, there is  a Special Guest Judge for this
highly global Viridian Contest.  Her decision is, of
course, globally final.  She is:</span></p>

HBR>

<p><span class="Default">Dr. Mary Kaldor, C.B.E.,<br>
from the Centre for the<br>
Study of Global Governance<br>
at the London School of<br>
<U>Economics and Political Science!</U><BR>
<BR></span></p>

<p><span class="Default">Dr. Kaldor literally wrote the yearbook on "Global
Civil Society."  Better yet, Dr. Kaldor agrees with me
that she needs a much cooler and more appropriate
computer.</span></p>

<p><span class="SubHead">Link:</span><br>
<span class="Default"><A HREF="http://www.lse.ac.uk/Depts/global/Yearbook/default.htm" >http://www.lse.ac.uk/Depts/global/Yearbook/default.htm</A>
<BR></span></p>

<p><span class="Default">Note these typical Dr. Mary Kaldor stomping grounds:
Helsinki Citizens Assembly, Kosovo Commission,
documenting the arms trade, "organized violence in a
global context," etc etc.</span></p>

<BR>
<BR></span></p>

<p><span class="Default">I ran into Mary Kaldor at a conference called
"Technologies of Anti/Counter/Terrorism."  Mary Kaldor is
certainly the most globally with-it Commander of the
British Empire that I have ever met.  If there's such a
thing as global civil society, well, here she is.
Viridian designers, knock yourselves out.</span></p>

<HR>

<p><span class="Default"><U>THE CONTEST PRIZE</U><BR>
<BR></span></p>

<p><span class="Default">In our last Viridian contest, the "Enron Logo"
contest, the winner received 100 shares of Enron
stock.  That's now worth, I dunno, literally less than the
paper it's printed on, but at least it's a collector's
item.</span></p>

<p><span class="Default">That was pretty generous by Viridian standards == but
it's nothing compared to this.  Because even though the
Global Civil Society Design Contest is relentlessly
noncommercial, we are upping the Viridian ante by
offering, for the first (and probably last) time ever:
COLD HARD CASH!!</span></p>

<p><span class="Default">That's right!  The prize is cash!  And none of that
flaccid, green, American funny-money, either. Instead,
it's this season's rapidly escalating, crisp, brand-new,
supranational, global-standard currency:</span></p>

<p><span class="Default">
<div align="center">$$$$$<br>
EUROS!<br>
$$$$$<br></div>
<BR>
<BR></span></p>

<p><span class="Default">Yes indeed! No fewer than 150 Euros, a staggering one
hundred and fifty of 'em!  And that's not all!  Because if
Microsoft (like so many other large American companies)
turns out to have some major accounting skeletons in its
closet, the value of these Euros could skyrocket
overnight.</span></p>

<p><span class="Default">Furthermore, these Euro bills represent an intriguing
state-of-the-art in high-security, trustable, paper-money
design. Unlike feeble old dollars, they've got uncopiable
color schemes, state-of-the-art security strips and big
embedded holograms!</span></p>

<p><span class="Default">Win this contest and this cash will be mailed
straight to you!
<BR></span></p>

<p><span class="Default">This contest expires August 15, 2002.</span></p>
