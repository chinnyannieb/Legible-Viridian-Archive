<p>"Bugs may control weather: Study<br>
May 27, 2002 Posted: 1333 GMT</p>
<p>"LONDON, England == British scientists have launched a study to find out  if
airborne bugs in clouds control the Earth's weather.</p>
<BR>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Scientists believe certain bug species may have evolved the 
ability to
manipulate the weather in order to secure their own survival.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A team of microbiologists from the University of East London 
(UEL) are
examining if the microbes play an active role in the formation of clouds and
making it rain.   (((One of those ominous notions that dawns on one with
Lovecraftian cosmic dread...  "And we've been, like, blasting hairspray into
these weather microbes?  AIEEE!")))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Using a revolutionary 'cyclonic cloud catcher', the team, led 
by Dr  Bruce
Moffett, will collect samples of cloud water from aircraft and on uplands
across the UK.   (((You'd have to know that they had some kind of cool
Viridian bug-catching gizmo.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"These samples will then be analysed to discover the 
composition and
activity  of any microbes present.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Preliminary analysis of samples already taken from low-lying 
cumulus
clouds  near Oxford has shown the presence of micro-organisms, including
ammonia-oxidising bacteria.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The 18-month pilot project, funded by a $190,000 (L130,000) 
grant from
the  Natural Environment Research Council, aims to test the theory that a
self-sustaining ecosystem exists in clouds and that bacteria and algae play a
key role in creating clouds and triggering rainfall.  (((Or, at least, there
<STRONG>used</STRONG> to be an ecosystem in the Earth's clouds, before we started sneezing
penicillin.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Until now scientists have been unable to accurately detect, 
identify and
analyse microbial communities in harsh conditions.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Dr Moffett said: 'We are looking for evidence that microbial 
metabolism
could  have a major influence on patterns of climate and weather today.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'A really exciting possibility is that microbes have evolved 
ways of
triggering cloud formation and rainfall to facilitate their own dispersal and
reproduction, in other words, they could be controlling the weather.'"  (...)</P>

<P>Supplies of oil may be inexhaustible</P>

<P>By Bruce Bartlett</P>

<P>   "On April 16, Newsday, the Long Island newspaper, published a startling
report that old oil fields in the Gulf of Mexico were somehow being refilled.
That is, new oil was being discovered in fields where it previously had not
existed.</P>

<P>   "Scientists, led by Mahlon Kennicutt of Texas A&amp;M University, speculate
that the new oil is surging upward from deposits well below those currently in
production. 'Very light oil and gas were being injected from below, even as
the producing was going on,' he said.</P>


<P>   "Although it is not yet known whether this is a worldwide phenomenon or
commercially important, the new discovery suggests that there may be far
more oil and gas within the Earth's core than previously thought.</P>

<P>   "Kennicutt is not the first to suggest that vast hydrocarbon deposits
may lie well below those currently known. In 1995, the New York Times
reported that geochemist Jean Whelan of the Woods Hole Oceanographic
Institution in Massachusetts had also found evidence that oil was moving
upward into reservoirs from somewhere far deeper.</P>

<P>   "With growing improvements in technology that are making possible oil
drilling at greater and greater depths, it may soon be economically feasible
to explore and produce oil from these deep deposits.</P>


<P>   "The existence of oil much farther below the surface than it was
previously thought to exist raises new questions about the origins of oil and
natural gas. It has commonly been thought that they are the decayed
remains of long dead plants and animals. However, as hydrocarbons are
found at extreme depths, this explanation becomes increasingly implausible.</P>

<P>   Astronomer Thomas Gold of Cornell University has long been dissatisfied
with the dead dinosaur theory of oil's origins. He argues that oil and gas are
in fact the remains of methane left over from the Earth's origin. Methane, he
points out, is one of the most common minerals in the universe. When the
stars and planets were formed eons ago, it was one of the central building
blocks from which matter formed.</P>

<A HREF="../76-100/00093.html">http://www.viridiandesign.org/notes/76-100/00093.html</A></P>

<P>(((And Note 00226.)))<br>
<A HREF="../226-250/00226_bug_news.html">http://www.viridiandesign.org/notes/226-250/00226_bug_news.html</A></P>

<P>   "If Gold's theory is true, then it makes sense that we would continue to
find hydrocarbons everywhere within the Earth's core, and not just at the
surface, where plants and animals exist. Thus the new research is at least
consistent with Gold's theory, even if it remains to be proven.</P>

<P>   "The new scientific evidence that energy supplies may be vastly greater
than previously imagined is only the latest blow to the doomsayers. Such
people have been around for 200 years, preaching that mankind has reached
the limit to growth because we have found all the oil there is to be found. For
at least a century, for example, the U.S. Geological Survey has consistently
reported that America had only about 10 years worth of oil left.</P>

<P>(((Time for a new kind of doomsayer == that if the planet is one huge
carbonaceous chondrite and we burn it all, we roast like dogs!)))</P>

<P>   "In defense of the Geological Survey, it was referring only to proven
reserves. These are fields that have been explored, and where estimates
have been made regarding their size and production potential. But of course,
exploration is a continuing process, so new reserves are discovered all the
time.</P>

<P>   "Economist Julian Simon long made the point that the size of proven
reserves cannot be divorced from the price of oil. At current price levels,
only about 40 percent of oil can be extracted from existing fields; the
remaining 60 percent, which is known to exist, cannot be produced
economically and is therefore not included in proven reserve estimates.
However, higher prices and advanced technology can easily make it profitable
to expand production in existing fields.</P>

<P>   "Higher prices also encourage exploration into areas that geologists
strongly suspect to have oil, but where drilling costs are too high at present.
Only a small portion of the Earth's surface has ever been explored for oil,
and there is no reason to believe that there are not many large deposits yet
to be discovered.</P>

<P>   "If oil were really becoming more scarce, we would expect to see prices
rising over time. In fact, the real price of oil, adjusted for inflation, has been
remarkably stable at around $15 per barrel. Temporary price spikes by OPEC
(the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries) have not proved
sustainable because they brought forth new supplies, encouraged
substitution of oil with coal or gas, and stimulated conservation by
consumers and businesses.  (((And how much do we have to pay
for the privilege of breathing?)))</P>

<P>   "In short, even if the new scientific evidence about oil is wrong, one can
still say the world will never run out of it. Higher prices will always bring new
supplies to market. As Bjorn Lomberg points out in his new book, The
Skeptical Environmentalist (Cambridge University Press), $40 per barrel oil
will immediately increase world reserves from a 40 years supply to 250
years because vast known oil shale deposits will become economically viable.</P>

<P>   "Of all the things we have to worry about in this day and age, running out
of oil should not be one of them.</P>
