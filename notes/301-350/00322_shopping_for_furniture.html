squeezie, (chem-organic or nuke waste future options)<br>
* Dynamic internal architecture (using an FPGA), change processor via downloads. Hardware crypto capability reconfigure to harmless Gameboy if captured. never obsolete<br>

</p>

<P>"Here's my personal favorite chair.  It's from the
Norwegian furniture maker  Stokke.  They also make the
Balans chair, the original kneeling chair == with rockers,
which makes the whole thing work, unlike all the fixed
imitators.  (I also have a Balans, which I need to get
reupholstered.  I  completely wore out both the fabric and
the cushions on it.)
</p>

<P>"The photos really don't do this chair justice.  Right
now I'm sitting in half-lotus on mine, and I'm perfectly
stable.
</p>

<P>"With this chair, I also use a pneumatically-
adjustable variable-height  table,  at about 36"; typical
office desk heights are  at about 28".  The difference is
wonderful.  Because my thighs never get  close to a front-
right angle with my back, lumbar stress is greatly
reduced.  It's better on my joints and on  my spine.  I
also generates muscle tone in the back rather than
atrophy.
</p>

<P>"With any of these backless chairs, upper back and
shoulder tone  improves from having to support the arms
with one's own body, rather than a  furniture element.
Significantly, by involving these muscles at the base
of the skeletal-keyboard interface, it reduces wrist
tendonitis by letting a larger muscle group move first.
</p>

<P>"I've use an Aeron, and while I like them better than
other office chairs, I still prefer my Move.  The biggest
problem is the need for a raised desk."</P>

<P>"May I shamelessly recommend Ambience Dore' , Inc. == a
corporate furniture brokerage I launched with a partner
last year. We sell new, used, and vintage furniture to
growing businesses and residential design denizens,
including:
</p>

<P>"A wide selection of cool ergonomic seating. Among the
chairs of note:
</p>

<P>"'Fluid' (like Aeron, but cheaper, with comfier mesh,
and a dizzying array of adjustment options):

<P>"Hip, affordable, and highly functional modular
furniture from a line called Indivi. They look like spinal
columns from ancient aluminum fish.

both a table and white board. For impromptu brainstorming
sessions.

</p>

<P>"Tibetan antique monk's cabinets that date from 14th
century (yes, 14th century) to the 20th century. Some of
our clients have customized them for use as media
cabinets.  They carry a faint aroma of burnt yak butter
and temple incense.  They're covered in intricate hand-
painted religious tableaus in organic pigments and animal
glues. Each piece is one-of-a-kind and is shipped with a
certificate of authenticity verifying heritage, date, and
descriptive background of context and symbology.<br>

"Bruce,</P>

<P>"Like mindlace, and like you, I hanker for various
furniture and design gubbish.  Everything I see is always
way out of my budget. Especially now that Herman Miller
killed their 'Red' line. And I still can't afford a Vecta
Lucy chair.
</p>

<P>"I've agreed with some (but not all) of your points
about 20th century design == the rust on the Breuer chair,
etc. == but it seems to me that the main failure of
Modernism (in design and architecture) was that the Big
Names failed to successfully tackle Good Design for the
Masses and Good Architecture for the Masses, even though
these were their explicitly stated ambitions.  I'm open to
being enlightened, but unfortunately, a guy like me can't
go out and buy a Usonian Automatic or a Dymaxion House.
</p>

<P>"What I can buy is yet another pile of bricks that
resembles Colonial Williamsburg.
</p>

<P>"These ideological struggles in architecture are as
arcane as the teapot tempests within science fiction
writing.  To most consumers, the opposition is not some
International Style box versus some Viridian self-
decomposing biomorphic glob.  The opposition is Anything
Modern versus their Dream McMansion (which comes in
Colonial, Tudor, or Mega-Cape-Cod).

<P>Then there's the question of eco visibility. Do you want
it to be <STRONG>apparent</STRONG> that your furniture is green? I doubt
it, unless you're trying to make a cocktail party point.
If you're the manufacturer, do you want to try to sell
furniture (solely) as green? Not if you want to make any
money.</P>

<P>Can somebody please make an exclusive list of eco-
responsible furniture designers/manufacturers? I'll help.</P>
