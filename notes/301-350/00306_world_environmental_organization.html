<P>UNITED NATIONS: April 2, 2002</P>

<P>"UNITED NATIONS &ndash; A new world environment organization
and an international environmental court would help make
sense of the more than 500 environmental agreements and
agencies now operating around the globe, researchers said
last week.</P>

The gig.
<BR></P>

<P>"Legal and environmental experts from the Tokyo-based
U.N. University called on a U.N. development summit
opening in Johannesburg in August to weigh creating a
global body with powers over the environment similar to
those of the World Trade Organization over international
trade.  (((Imagine the fun as thousands of coal-mining
labor unions clog the streets at their every meeting.)))
<BR></P>

<P>"Their report said environmental regulation has emerged
in an ad hoc and somewhat chaotic fashion over the past 30
years due to 'the essentially random emergence of
environmental issues onto national and international
political agendas.'  (((Greens "emerging"... yes, that's
"essentially random.")))
<BR></P>

<P>"The soaring number of global environmental
institutions argues strongly that the current system of
international environmental governance is 'too complicated
(and) steadily getting worse,' the experts said.  (((Hey,
I believe that assessment &ndash; because I trust the
experts!)))
<BR></P>

<P>"They acknowledged that giving teeth to a new global
agency was one of the most controversial aspects of the
debate as governments are reluctant to turn over their
powers to an outside body that could rule against them.
((("Giving teeth," is it?   "Your cruise missiles have
arrived, Mr World Environment.")))</P>

<P>"But 'one of the core benefits to be offered by a
judicial settlement system is that it could bring a much
greater level of predictability to international
environmental governance by ending serious violations of
international environmental law regardless of the
perpetrator,' their report argued.  ((("ExxonMobil
smokestacks sighted in Tora Bora. Coalition forces close
in.")))
<BR></P>

<P>"In addition, problems like global warming and
pollution simply transcend national interests, they said.
(((It's always pretty "simple" to transcend <STRONG>other
people's</STRONG> national interests.)))
