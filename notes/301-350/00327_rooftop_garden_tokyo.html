<P class="head">"Tokyo turns to rooftop gardens to beat the heat</p>
<p>JAPAN: August 7, 2002</P>

<P>by Chang-Ran Kim</P>

<P>"TOKYO &ndash; At a run-down three-storey office block in
downtown Tokyo, government clerks and secretaries cool off
amongst azaleas, hydrangeas and even blueberry bushes
during coffee breaks, seemingly far away from the
sweltering urban heat. The garden is not a perk for
bureaucrats or reckless use of taxes in a city with some
of the world's priciest real estate.
</p>

<P>"It's on the roof and, what's more, it's saving money.
The oasis is the brainchild of Kazuyoshi Kojima, a 52-
year-old public servant spearheading the drive to lower
temperatures in Japan's cities.
</p>

<P>"Trapped by concrete and asphalt, the heat from heavy
traffic and millions of air-conditioning units have made
summer in the cities hotter &ndash; a phenomenon known as the
'heat-island effect'. 'The rooftop garden helps to absorb
heat and keeps temperatures inside the building lower,'
Kojima says.
</p>

<P>"'We used to set the air-conditioner at 20 degrees
Celsius (68 Fahrenheit), and it was still unbearably hot.
By having the garden up top, a setting of 27 or 28 degrees
is just right.' Similarly, in the winter the building only
needs one hour of heating; for the rest of the day the
heat is contained, significantly reducing electricity
costs.
</p>

<P>"The drive to cool down Tokyo's summers comes not a
moment too soon. Last month, the temperature in the city
of 12 million averaged 28.0 degrees Celsius, almost three
degrees higher than it was in the same month 30 years ago.
</p>

<P>"In 1972, there was just one day in July when the
temperature did not fall under 25 degrees, compared with
15 days this year.
</p>

<P>"Plenty of ideas have been suggested to beat the heat,
including one that would involve running cool water
through a huge labyrinth of pipes under the city.
</p>

<P>"But that could be years away, and the scheme could
possibly damage the fragile marine ecosystem as the warmed
water is dumped back into sea. <b>(((See Note 00326.)))</b></P>


<P class="h2">"IT'S THE LAW</p>

<P>"Assigned to tackle the heat-island phenomenon for
Tokyo's Shibuya ward two years ago, Kojima helped draw up
legislation requiring new buildings bigger than 300 square
metres (3,230 sq ft) at ground level to plant gardens on a
fifth of that surface.
</p>

<P>"That mandate is the strictest in the country, and
has paid off so visibly that even the Tokyo city
government is reconsidering its own regulations in the
hope of emulating Shibuya's success.
</p>

<P>"Lately, Kojima says, he even gets phone calls from
embassies inquiring about the project. Tokyo passed its
own law in April 2001 stipulating that new buildings with
a roof area of more than 1,000 square metres must plant
greenery on 20 percent of the surface. To get around the
costly task, however, many builders have slanted their
roofs because the guideline applies only to flat surfaces.
<b>(((Oh, that was clever of them.)))</b>
</p>

<P>"Under its plan, the capital hopes to add 1,200
hectares (2,965 acres) of greenery on its rooftops over 15
years. At the pace it's going now, that could take up to
120 years. (...) <b>(((Don't worry, boys, the Greenhouse
Effect will still be around then.)))</b>)
</p>

<P>"Kojima, who gave advice on product development before
becoming a public servant, <b>(((hey check it out &ndash; an
industrial design guy)))</b> believes the secret of his
success lies in his unorthodox ideas and penchant for
risk-taking.
</p>

<P>"When he was handed the mission two years ago, he
admits, he could not tell a cherry tree and plum tree
apart. But to give builders and firms an idea of what the
ward was asking of them, he decided to set up a model on
the ward office's own rooftop.</P>

<P class="h2">"TEACHING BY EXAMPLE
</p>

<P>"His budget was zero and he had no assistants. <b>(((A
Viridian hero!)))</b> Undaunted, Kojima walked around asking
companies for help. He eventually found 29 willing firms
and succeeded in converting the bare rooftop into a green
oasis for free. Kojima went a step further. To assist both
builders and suppliers, he came up with the idea of having
the ward act as a go-between. The ward would recommend a
list of carefully chosen suppliers to a builder, which in
return would get a 20 percent discount on services or
products from the suppliers.
</p>

<P>"Kojima inspected all rooftop gardens to make sure
they met Shibuya's high standards. The results impressed
the ward's administrators. To encourage more gardening,
they decided to grant subsidies &ndash; shelling out money for
the project for the first time &ndash; to suppliers who
participate in voluntary planting. Kojima also got two
assistants.
</p>

<P>"The subsidies have paid off already. Of the total
7,000 square metres planted so far, a fifth was on
existing buildings voluntarily. 'Rooftop gardening is the
sort of thing anyone can do if they put their minds to
it,' Kojima says. 'It really doesn't have to cost that
much money.'
</p>

<P>"Kojima, a nature-lover who years ago bought a patch
of forest to prevent it from landing in the hands of golf-
course developers, <b>(((he's a living saint!)))</b> said his
goal was to cover half of Shibuya with greenery, while
setting a good example so others would follow.
</p>

<P>"'When I was young, all you needed to fend off the
heat in the summer was a hand-held fan,' he says. 'I
believe we could go back to that if we press on.'"</P>
