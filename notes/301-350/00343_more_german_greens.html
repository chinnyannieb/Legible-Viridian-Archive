with a toy.  You need a whole <STRONG>product line</STRONG> if you want
any channel power.  Introducing dogg13z (tm) connected

ready to roll in time for Christmas 2003, and I've also

German Green politics by an actual German Viridian,
Alexander Schuth of the Viridian Curia.)))</b></P>

<P>My commentary below on Note 00342. Cheers, Alexander.</P>

<P>&gt;"(...)  The Greens had 51,000 members in 1998. Now they
have only 46,000.</P>

<P>The Greens used to be anti-nuclear energy, anti-nuclear
arms, strictly pacifist and ecological. And they led
Germany into the first war since WWII (yes, we didn't have
any for over 50 years). This new belligerent tooth cost
them dearly.</P>

<P>&gt;Greens' triumph was due to Fischer, the revolutionary-
&gt;turned-realist whose personal charisma the party traded
&gt;on ruthlessly.</P>

<P>Yes, "ruthlessly." When the Greens went into parliament,
they introduced a rotation principle.  After half of the
legislative period, the holder of the seat would step down
to let the next in line have it. That was in the 80s, and
when "Fundis" - fundamentalist greens - and "Realos" -
realpolitically oriented greens, spearheaded by Josef
Fischer - started to differ much about which political
course to support in the first governmental alliances, the
Realos abandoned this principle, so their power base did
not fall into the hands of eco-extremist Fundis.</P>

<P>Anyway, the Greens always played their personnel down, to
keep political and party posts separated (e.g. SPD's
Gerhard Schroeder is head of SPD <STRONG>and</STRONG> the head of
government. CDU's Helmut Kohl used to be boss of CDU, the
CDU's parliamentary fraktion in Bundestag, <STRONG>and</STRONG> be head
of government). The Greens by contrast put party and
programme out front.</P>

<P>This time, however, they abandoned this time-honored
tradition, putting up posters saying "Second vote =
Joschka-vote." (You get two votes in federal elections -
one for your area's direct candidate, one for the parties'
state-wide list of candidates.  So you can split your
vote, as many did in my state of Hessen: first vote for
SPD direct candidates, second vote for the Green party
list).  The Greens strongly marketed Fischer's persona. A
smart move, considering that he is the best foreign
minister since Genscher of the liberal FDP and the most
popular politician in Germany (pre-election surveys gave
him 70% of the population seeing him as most popular).
But the Greens also severed many traditions from their old
streetmarching days.</P>

<P>Talking about streets: yes, Joschka Fischer used to be a
streetfighting Marxist thug, from the legendary Frankfurt
leftist circles (which had communist to terrorist flavors,
at least since the student rebellion of 1968, which took
mainly place in Paris, Berlin and Frankfurt, with many
ideas going back to Frankfurt's lecturers Marcuse, Adorno,
etc. - the whole social studies posse called "Frankfurter
Schule"). But that was the 70s.  Other alumni of these
streetfighting years became social workers, satirists, or
they run an internationally renowned old school-cabaret
now called "Tiger Palast".   Fischer was ruthless in his
later Green party career, fighting down opposition with
any means, trying to get things go his way. And usually,
he succeeded.</P>

<P>&gt;"They also won their first outright constituency seat
&gt;through anti-war campaigner Christian Stroebele, who
&gt;drove a small electric car throughout
&gt;his campaign.  <b>(((Beep-beep!)))</b></P>

<P>Stroebele got his seat in Berlin through a genius
campaign: "Vote Stroebele = torture Joschka."</P>

<P>The Green party didn't even put Stroebele on the state
list for Berlin state, so if he would have failed, he
wouldn't have made it. The Greens HATE Stroebele. He's old
school Fundi, strictly pacifist, and opposes any
compromises that the Realos plot: "Go to war? Fine with
us, if we get to shut down the nuclear reactors..." etc.
Stroebele doesn't deal like that. He doesn't play along,
doesn't like dancing to Fischer's tune. Great guy, good
entertainment. He's quite a loose cannon.</P>

<P>One or two days before the election, a neonazi moron
attacked Stroebele with a steel pipe while he was manning
his campaign booth in his constituency, beating him on the
head. Stroebele was hospitalised shortly with serious
concussions. Maybe getting a pipe over the head swung all
those nice votes for him. I wish more pols would try that
next time!</P>

<P>The SPD-Gruenen-coalition has only a very thin majority,
so Stroebele might become a serious risk to their
legislative votes in Bundestag.</P>

<P>&gt;"The Greens took special issue with chancellor candidate
&gt;Edmund Stoiber's failure to appoint a person responsible
&gt;for environmental affairs in his much-publicised shadow
&gt;cabinet.</P>

<P>And still Stoiber got an outrageously great result for a
guy from Bavaria! THAT really scared me. Who wants to be
governed by crooked politicians from a state with absolute
one-party rule since 1949? Especially if they are the
direct political heirs of former Nazi-ideology-teachers-
turned-prime-minister-of Bavaria, Franz-Josef Strauss?
That's like a prosperous North Korea with leather pants!</P>

<P>Allow me to offer to you these two tasty bits of popular
opinion on this topic:</P>

<P>Links:
Re: Bundestagswahl:
<A HREF="http://www.bleib-da-wo-der-radi-waechst.de" >http://www.bleib-da-wo-der-radi-waechst.de</A>
Anti-Stoiber-Song ("Berlin, Berlin - du gehst nicht nach
Berlin" - football-fan-like chant as killer refrain "You
won't make it to Berlin") which really made headlines.</P>

<P>The guys who did this went on MTV and the like. Serious
press. Plus they're good folks, I know some of them.</P>

<P>Tanz den Berlusconi:
<A HREF="http://www.beatline.de" >http://www.beatline.de</A>
Click on "gallomat" and download.</P>

<P>This is a contemporary cover version of D.A.F.'s (Deutsch-
Amerikanische Freundschaft = "German-American Friendship")
classic new wave song "Tanz den Mussolini" ("Dance the
Mussolini... And now dance the Adolf Hilter..."). See if
you can hear out some current pols from this new version.
It's basically the "Neue Mitte"-thing (the new middle =
not leftist, not rightwing).  Supposedly the mainstream...
Only the mainstream today is what rightwing was ten,
fifteen years ago.</P>

<P><BR>
&gt;<b>(((Yeah, but who cares? We're rich businessmen!)))</b></P>


<P>Exactly. And they all got their cozy hideaways in
Berchtesgaden, Bavaria, up on mountain sides, just like
(and where) Adolf used to: "Dat guy knew what was good!"</P>

<P>&gt;<b>(((Too bad it's political suicide everywhere but Germany and
&gt;far from a majority taste even there.)))</b></P>
<p>The problem is Eco tax ain't very eco. The revenue
  doesn't go into anything green like it ought to, but
  rather into pensions and social security. Big-car owners
  curse it or - if they REALLY can afford to laff off the
  couple of bucks - they joke about burning a couple extra
  liters with their big cars "to help making old age safe
  for the needy."</p>


<P>Next time you pass through Rhein-Main airport, gimme a
ring and I'll buy you a beer.</P>

<P>Cheers, Alexander</P>
