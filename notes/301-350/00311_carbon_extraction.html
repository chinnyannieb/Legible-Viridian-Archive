<P><strong>Attention Conservation Notice: </strong> It's far-fetched.
On the other hand, there may already be enough
carbon dioxide in the air to destroy our civilization.
In which case, notions like these become
intensely interesting. Over 2,000 words.</P>

<P>(((Okay, Craig Venter, right?  That gene-splicing guy.
He's decided to suck all the excess CO2 out
of the air by feeding it to genetically souped-up
microbes from oceanic abysses.  Hey, it could happen.
Remember, nobody thought Venter could shotgun the
human genome in jig time, either.)))</P>

<P>"A New Outlet for Venter's Energy
"Genome Maverick To Take On Global Warming</P>

<P>By Justin Gillis
Washington Post Staff Writer
Tuesday, April 30, 2002<a href="http://www.weblogsky.com">;</a> Page E01</P>

<P>"J. Craig Venter, the maverick scientist who altered
history when he chose to compile a human genetic map with
private money, has settled on his next project: tackling
the problem of global warming.</P>

<P>"Tapping a $100 million research endowment he is creating
from his stock holdings, (((good thing he's not in
telecom))) Venter plans to scour the world's deep ocean
trenches for bacteria that might be able to convert carbon
dioxide, the gas released when cars and power plants burn
fuel, back into solid form without needing a lot of
sunlight or other energy.</P>

<P>"The idea is to devise a technology that would allow
humankind to continue producing energy while lowering
emissions of the gas, which threatens to destabilize the
Earth's climate.</P>

<P>"'We've barely scratched the surface of the microbial
world out there to try to help the environment,' Venter
said in an interview. 'We're going to be searching for
some dramatic new microbes.'</P>

<P>"Venter has a 20-year track record of upending scientific
dogma and developing new approaches that other scientists
eventually embrace. (...)</P>

<P>"Venter recently confirmed that the genome Celera
sequenced was in large measure his own. He said he felt
that if he was going to ask people to surrender their
genetic privacy for the sake of science, he ought to go
first. (((An attitude that speaks for itself.))) (...)</P>

<P>"I'm quite proud of my accomplishments there," Venter
said. "But I did not want to run a pharmaceutical
company."</P>

<P>"Because of his track record, Venter's plans to jump into
environmental 'bioremediation' could draw money,
competition and public attention to that obscure field.</P>

<P>"In an interview last week, which he granted subject to a
news blackout that lifted this morning, Venter showed off
his new headquarters, the entire top floor of a large
Rockville office building. The offices were empty but for
a few tables and chairs and three assistants whom Venter
has hired away from Celera.</P>

<P>"Venter, 55, sat behind a whistle-clean makeshift desk,
looking relaxed in dark-gray pants and a light-gray shirt.
Workmen hurried to and fro removing signs of the previous
occupant, a bank.  (((Too bad the "previous occupant" of
Venter's new digs wasn't Enron instead of a bank, but
well, same difference.)))</P>

<P>"Venter emphasized that from now on, his ventures will be
set up as not-for-profit corporations. 'I'm not in
business anymore,' he said.</P>

<P>"The energy venture is merely the most ambitious of three
new entities he plans to create. One, the J. Craig Venter
Science Foundation, will hold much of the cash and stock
Venter acquired in his jobs at Celera and an earlier
association with Human Genome Sciences Inc., also of
Rockville. Venter had previously said much of the money
would go to scientific research, and the foundation is
intended to formalize that arrangement.</P>

<P>"The money will support the work of his other two
creations. One new entity will be a combination of think
tank and specialized research shop that will focus on many
of the social issues raised by the genetic science that
Venter has helped to push forward. (...)</P>

<P>"The think tank will be closely linked to the Institute
for Genomic Research, a nonprofit laboratory Venter
founded years ago that is now run by his wife, Claire
Fraser, an accomplished genetic scientist. That lab,
widely known as TIGR and based in Rockville, attracts
extensive government funding and is the world's premier
center for researching the genetics of bacteria. The new
think tank will be called the TIGR Center for the
Advancement of Genomics. Genomics is the study, at a broad
scale, of the complete genetic inheritance of organisms ==
their genomes.</P>

<P>"Venter is calling his third new entity the Institute for
Biological Energy Alternatives. Venter expects to go after
grant money from the U.S. Department of Energy and to have
scores of scientists on board within a year. His goal will
be to explore whether modern science can use the power of
biology to solve the world's most serious environmental
crisis.</P>

<P>"As industrial societies burn fossil fuels for energy,
they are releasing vast amounts of carbon, previously
locked in solid form, into the atmosphere as carbon
dioxide. Rising concentrations of the gas are trapping
extra heat from the sun == the famous "greenhouse effect"
== and warming the Earth. Estimates of the impact of this
warming in the current century begin with severe economic
disruption and the dislocation of millions of people and
get worse from there.  (((Note: we are setting heat
records in Austin and it is barely May.  Earlier this
week, a historically unprecedented F5 tornado in Maryland
smashed-up a suburb of Washington DC.)))</P>

<P><BR>
"As political efforts to cut the use of energy have
stalled, many scientists, Venter among them, have grown
fascinated by the possibility of a technological fix.
(((Political and economic fixes being effectively stymied
by Exxon-Mobil.))) The Energy Department has for several
years been funding research in the field, which is known
as 'carbon sequestration.'</P>

<P>"Scientists are exploring a wide range of ideas, some
quite modest and some as wild as fertilizing parts of the
ocean to spark growth of algae that would take up carbon
dioxide. The Bush administration has supported a broad
portfolio of such research and has been increasing funds
for it even in tight budget times.  (((Coal guys like
sequestration research and hate everything else.)))</P>

<P>"Among the most pragmatic ideas are those that would
install colonies of organisms in 'bioreactors' near power
plants to suck up emissions of carbon dioxide and turn the
gas into solids such as sugars, proteins and starches ==
which might themselves be useful byproducts.  ((("Eat the
Greenhouse!"  Of course, that merely turns the atmosphere
to sewage, but...)))  Plant cells can already do this, of
course, but they require vast amounts of energy in the
form of sunlight, and many scientists believe they are
likely to prove impractical on a large scale.</P>

<P>"Venter plans to base his approach on one of the most
striking developments in biology in recent years == the
discovery, in deep ocean trenches and volcanic hot spots
on the ocean floor, of a wide array of bacteria that can
perform extensive chemical reactions without needing
sunlight. These are thought to be descendants of the most
primitive life forms that arose on the Earth, and
scientists are just beginning to explore their potential.</P>

<P>"Venter said he hopes to find == or, if necessary, create
through genetic engineering (((yeehaw!))) == an ideal
organism or group of organisms that would be able to take
in carbon dioxide, break it down, and produce both
biological compounds and energy.  (((Of course, if those
bugs ever get loose in the wild, prepare for a permanent
ice age.)))</P>

<P>"Ari Patrinos, associate director of science for
biological and environmental research at the Energy
Department, said he had been discussing futuristic
solutions to the energy problem with Venter for a decade
and is excited to hear Venter is planning a big move into
the field. He cautioned, however, that a great deal of
fundamental research remains to be done.</P>


<P>"'I think it is indicative of the seriousness of these
problems that they are attracting prominent scientists,'
Patrinos said. 'People recognize that some of these
problems are stubborn nuts to crack. We need to address
them as aggressively as we can with the very best minds.'"</P>

<P>(((Let's hope that Venter's abyssal genesplicing lab isn't
hit by an F-5 tornado, its contents scattered hither and
thither just like La Plata, Maryland.  Meanwhile, in Los
Alamos...)))</P>

<P>"Imagine No Restrictions On Fossil-Fuel Usage And No
Global Warming ((("No Problem, The Bush Administration
Can Imagine Anything")))</P>

<P>"ORLANDO, Fla., April 9, 2002 == Researchers at the U.S.
Department of Energy's Los Alamos National Laboratory are
studying a simple, cost-effective method for extracting
carbon dioxide directly from the air == which could allow
sustained use of fossil fuels while avoiding potential
global climate change. (((Well, there's still sulfur,
mercury and acid rain, plus strip-mining, asthma and
blacklung, but why be all picky.)))
<BR></P>

<P>"(...)  A Los Alamos-led research team today presented
the topic at the 223rd annual meeting of the American
Chemical Society in Orlando, Fla. (((Note: not a bunch of
flakes or kooks.)))
<BR></P>

<P>"'Fossil fuel supplies are plentiful, and what will
limit the usage of fossil fuels is the potential climatic
and ecosystem changes you may see as a result of rising
CO2 levels in the atmosphere,' said Los Alamos researcher
Manvendra Dubey. 'If you can capture atmospheric carbon
dioxide, then you limit the environmental impact of fossil
fuels and you can continue to use them. ((Or, you can just
use them in callous disregard of millions dying.)))
<BR></P>

<P>"'We have come up with a way to capture and sequester
the carbon dioxide that we are putting in the atmosphere.
Our approach is particularly well suited to capturing CO2
from numerous small sources such as automobiles that are
largely being ignored.' (((They don't suck it out of
tailpipes.  They build a giant chemical plant in the
desert and launder the whole atmosphere.)))
<BR></P>

<P>"While many scientists are working on capturing or
sequestering carbon, Dubey and his colleagues' method
differs because it works on a dilute stream of CO2 in the
atmosphere as opposed to capturing more concentrated forms
found in power plant exhausts. The method uses ordinary
air with its average carbon dioxide concentration of about
370 parts per million. (((About 60 parts per million too
much.)))
<BR></P>

<P>"(...) The air is passed over an extraction agent, for
example a solution of quicklime, the active agent in some
cement. As the air passes over the extraction structure,
the carbon dioxide in the air reacts with the quicklime
and becomes converted to calcium carbonate (limestone), a
solid that forms and falls to the bottom of the extractor.
<BR></P>

<P>"The calcium carbonate is then heated to yield pure
carbon dioxide and quicklime, which is recycled back into
the extractor. The purified and liberated carbon dioxide
can then be sequestered as a gas by direct injection into
the ground or it could be reacted with minerals to form a
solid. Carbon dioxide gas also can be sold commercially to
the petrochemical industry, which uses large quantities of
it to extract fossil fuels. (...)
<BR></P>

<P>"'The carbon dioxide comes to the facility on its
own,' Dubey said. 'And because treated air is discharged,
the overall concentration of carbon dioxide in the
atmosphere gradually decreases over time. Using this
method on a large enough scale, it may be possible to
return atmospheric carbon dioxide levels to pre-
Industrial-Age concentrations. Given the possibility our
climate system can change abruptly, this possibility is
very exciting." (((Blocks of CO2 being hastily shoved into
abandoned coal mines as centers of government wither and
melt.)))
<BR></P>

<P>"Cost of the entire process is equivalent to about 20
cents per gallon of gasoline == a nominal cost when one
considers the recent price fluctuations at gasoline pumps
across the nation, Dubey said. A typical extraction
facility that could extract all current carbon dioxide
emissions would require only an area of one square yard
per person in the developed world.  ((("Only"?
"Developed"?)))
<BR></P>

<P>A facility of sufficient size could be located in
arid regions, since discharged air that is deficient in
carbon dioxide could have consequences on nearby plant
life. ((("Consequences"?)))
<BR></P>

<P>"Large expanses of desert would not be affected by the
CO2 deficit however, and could provide the wide-open
spaces necessary both for the facility and to allow the
discharged air to become well mixed with the atmosphere
again. ((("The CO2 Sacrifice Zone".)))
<BR></P>

<P>"The next step for Dubey and his colleagues is to use
intense computer models to optimize the configuration of
the extractor as well as design alternative chemicals for
extraction. Dubey's research colleagues include Hans
Ziock, Scott Elliott and William S. Smith of Los Alamos;
Klaus Lackner, formerly of Los Alamos and now also at
Columbia University; and Pat Grimes of Grimes Associates
of Scotch Plains, N.J. Los Alamos National Laboratory is
operated by the University of California for the National
Nuclear Security Administration (NNSA) of the U.S.
Department of Energy and works in partnership with NNSA's
Sandia and Lawrence Livermore national laboratories to
support NNSA in its mission.
<BR></P>

<P>"Los Alamos enhances global security by ensuring the
safety and reliability of the U.S. nuclear stockpile,
developing technologies to reduce threats from weapons of
mass destruction, and solving problems related to energy,
environment, infrastructure, health and national security
concerns."</P>
