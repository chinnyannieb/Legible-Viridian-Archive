dead, rotting stuff falling out of ancient ice.</P>

<P>"Melting Glaciers Release Ancient Relics"
by Kevin Krajick</P>

<P>"As alpine glaciers around the world succumb to warming,<br>
scientists are reaping grand harvest of frozen organic<BR>
objects &ndash; and with them previously unavailable<BR>
information on past wildlife, human culture, genetics,<BR>
climate, and more.<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<BR>

<P>"Tissues with intact DNA and archaeological objects of
wood and bone provide pictures that stone tools only hint
at, and because they can all be radiocarbon dated, there<br>
is little guessing about chronology.  Up to now, such<BR>
well-preserved objects from the last 10,000 years &ndash; after<BR>
the retreat of the last great ice sheets &ndash; had been<BR>
vanishingly rare in most parts of the world.  (((I suppose<BR>
there's some faint hope to be found in the sure knowledge<BR>
that, a mere 11,000 years ago, places like New York City<BR>
were under miles of solid ice.)))<BR>
<BR>
"Because the frozen objects are so valuable &ndash; and<BR>
decay so fast once exposed &ndash; a growing cadre of<BR>
scientists is trying to predict and comb fertile spots.<BR>
'The potential for discovery in many fields is<BR>
tremendous,' says Yukon Territory wildlife biologist Rick<BR></P>

interdisciplinary team that now regularly harvests Yukon
ice.  'It's one of the few positive things to climate
change.'"</P>

Scientist Beth Shapiro makes the scene at melting
ice in the Yukon.</P>

<P>"Vanishing Ice</P>


"Glaciers have been thinning and retreating since the mid-19th century &ndash; Switzerlands's have declined a third in volume since 1860 &ndash; but now the pace is accelerating and with it the urgency to collect stranded perishables. Many regions have not been so warm for 8000 years of more, so some frozen objects may be at least that old. 
<br>
and
<P>"In March, the University of Colorado published a
report by glaciologist Mark Dyurgerov estimating that
mountain glaciers worldwide are losing 90 cubic kilometers
of ice a year, with those in Alaska, the Andes, and central Asia dwindling particularly fast."  (((Horrifying &ndash; yet not too surprising when you consider that chunk of<BR>
Antarctica that just melted. It was the size of a small<BR>
European country.)))<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<BR>

<P>"Glaciologist Lonnie Thompson of Ohio State University,
Columbus, says that the Qori Kalis glacier in the Peruvian
Andes, which has retreated by 4.7 meters a year since the
1960s, has suddenly started wasting that much in a week
and that the famous snows of Mount Kilimanjaro may be
completely gone by 2015."  (((Can't say they didn't warn
us about it; <STRONG>can</STRONG> say that oil companies made sure the US
government wouldn't do anything useful. What will
"glaciologists" call themselves when there aren't any
glaciers left?  "Starving climatic refugees," that might
be a good guess.)))
<BR></P>

<P>(...)  "Dozens of bird species migrate over the ice
fields and surprisingly often crash by the flockful, later
to turn up in snowbanks like raisins in a fruitcake.  Even
whole forests are sometimes encased by advancing ice, as
shown by large intact ancient trees washing out of
glaciers in Alaska and Switzerland. (...)  Humans have</P>

<P>also crossed glaciers far more often than previously<BR>
thought. (...) Some natives and later travelers &ndash;<BR>
including countless 19th century gold prospectors &ndash;<BR>
starved, froze or plunged down the emerald-shaded depths<BR>
of crevasses.  'Some of these people have a long way to<BR>
go, but we'll see them again,' says Gerry Holdsworth, a<BR></P>

<P>glaciologist at the University of Calgary, Alberta.
<BR></P>

<P>(...)  "So far, the artifacts are stunning.  There are
wooden weapons shafts of birch, spruce and willow up to 2
meters long, some with antler projectile points attached.
One point still has caribou blood on it.  There is a
finely-serrated ivory blade of unknown purpose. (....)
The group has even found two bows of maple, apparently
carried over the glaciers 80 kilometers from Alaska, where
maples grow.
<BR></P>

<P>"The Canadian Iceman himself, found just south of the
Yukon, wore a squirrel-fur cloak and a finely woven hat
much like those seen in the region today and carried a
bone-and-metal knife, a spear, and a snack of dried fish</P>

<P>in a leather bag.  About 20  when he died, he was dated to<BR>
'only' about 550 years ago &ndash; disappointing scientists but<BR>
delighting northwestern Native Americans, because he could<BR>
be someone's great-ancestor. (...)  The Native Americans<BR>
dubbed the frozen mummy <STRONG>Kwaday Dan Ts'inchi</STRONG> &ndash; Long Ago<BR>
Person Found &ndash; and started their own DNA analysis project<BR></P>

<P>to see to whom he might be related.  (...)  After making
sure that scientists had enough samples, in July 2001
Indians held a potlatch, cremated him, and had his ashes
airlifted by helicopter close to where he died.
<BR></P>

<P>(...)  "To get ahead of the curve, scientists are now
trying to pinpoint good prospecting spots.  'We know
things melt out, but the real problem is predicting
exactly where they'll appear,' says archaeologist James
Dixon of the University of Colorado Institute of Arctic
and Alpine Research (INSTAAR).
<BR></P>

<P>"Dixon and glaciologist William Manley, also of
INSTAAR, heave spent the last 3 years assembling a Global
Information System model to map potentially fruitful areas
in Alaska, which hey hope to apply to other areas of the
world.  Their charts overlay glaciological data, such as
the altitude below which particular glaciers are melting,
with information such as trade routes, ancient stone
quarries, mineral licks, and other places where people and
animals may have been." (...)</P>
