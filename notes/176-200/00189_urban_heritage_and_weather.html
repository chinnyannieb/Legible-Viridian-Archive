<P>While this first story from London is  good news, the
melting away of many cultural landmarks  is something we
can look forward to (?) over the next couple of decades,
and is an unmitigated cultural disaster.</P>

<P>Perhaps we ought to be recording/ reconstructing what
these places looked like at their moments of glory, if
only so that future generations can have a sense of what</P>

<P>is no longer there (e.g., an inch of stone). It'd be a<BR>
nice way of making visible the invisible == compiling a<BR>
collection of cultural monuments lost or defaced by<BR>
pollution and/or weather violence.<BR></P>

<P>"London can breathe again
<BR></P>

<P>by Peter Gruner
<BR></P>

<P>"Wear and tear on the walls of St Paul's Cathedral
has halved in 10 years,  proving conclusively, say
experts, that air pollution in the capital is steadily
decreasing.
<BR></P>

<P>"While emphasising that there is no room for
complacency, scientists who have been monitoring erosion
for more than 20 years believe the capital's air is
cleaner now than at any time since the start of the
Industrial Revolution.
<BR></P>

<P>"About an inch of stone from the cathedral's balcony
has dissolved since 1720, says the report, but this is the
first time there has been a marked decrease in
acidification since measurements began in the Seventies."

<P>"That Sinking Feeling, Again, as Venice's Past Haunts
City's Future
<BR></P>

<P>By WILLIAM J. BROAD
<BR></P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>"VENICE == Science often rests on chance discoveries.<BR>
So it is that an American archaeologist studying the<BR>
origins of Venice has stumbled on clues suggesting that a<BR>
multibillion-dollar plan to build floodgates to save the<BR>
city from rising waters is doomed. (...)<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<BR>

<P>"Discoveries show that, over the ages, people living
here have had to haul in countless tons of dirt, silt,
wood and stone to fortify their swampy isles and keep</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>their homes and cities from disappearing into the sea. And<BR>
the findings suggest that the floodgates plan ==<BR>
one of the biggest public works projects of all time ==<BR>
could produce as many problems as it solves, causing wide<BR>
ecological damage.<BR></P>

<BR>

<P>"'You have to see this to understand how the ground
builds up,' said Dr. Ammerman, a Colgate University
archaeologist who has studied the origins of Venice for
more than a decade. That the city rests on millions of
wooden stilts pounded into marshy ground is well known.
But the surprising age and abundance of other kinds of
supporting materials is only now coming to light, with
large implications for public policy.
<BR></P>

<P>"The lost world of artifacts and structures is
letting Dr. Ammerman and his colleagues in Italy and the
United States estimate both past and future rates of
subsidence. The news is bad for a city whose famous
piazzas and streets already flood with alarming
regularity.
<BR></P>

<P>"For complex reasons, the scientists say, Venice is
sinking faster than ever and in the coming century the
encroaching waters of the Adriatic Sea could devastate
this celebrated city of art and architecture. The
situation will only get worse if global warming causes
seas to rise.
<BR></P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>"In fact, they say, surging waters will overwhelm<BR>
the main way Italy is planning to fight the danger == 79<BR>
mobile floodgates meant to cut off the Venetian lagoon and<BR>
its islands from the highest of the high tide. (...)"<BR></P>

(((bruces remarks:  Architecture writer Martin Pawley
points out that massive urban destruction from the Second
World War led to the high point of Modernism.  In terms of
ambitious construction and visionary urban planning, it's
all been downhill since those carpet-bombings.   Pawley
thinks that architecture has been strangled by today's
museum-economy in Britain, and that de-registration of
many sites is in order.  Then, much tiresome Tudor dreck
could be scraped off with dozers, to be replaced with
fine, clean, gleaming, energy-efficient structures!
<BR></P>

<P>(((Since Venice has clearly always been radically
unsustainable, a strange and crazy place to build a city,
one wonders what's with the sudden sense of despair here.
Why not just heap up more Gothic trash and pound in more
medieval wooden stakes? You didn't see the Lombards
moaning and whining.
<BR></P>

<P>(((On a note much closer to the bone, my own much
younger city of Austin is currently suffering a
historically unprecedented heat wave.  Labor Day 02000 was
the hottest day ever recorded in this city.  Streets are
deserted as holiday-makers, unable to go outside, huddle
in their air conditioning, consuming huge amounts of
fossil-fuels in a Venice-like effort to keep that ever-
rising heat at bay.  Even the nights are suffocatingly
hot, as if swathed in thick fiberglass blankets, while an
occasional dusty, strangely fetid breeze stirs the leaves</P>

<P>of the wilting trees.  This is uncanny weather which is<BR>
genuinely frightening == it's as if the Greenhouse Effect,<BR>
also so easy to dismiss when it wreaks its havoc on<BR>
distant strangers, is once again at my very doorstep, with<BR>
a hood and scythe.)))<BR></P>
