<P>Attention Conservation Notice:  It's another in our series
of Viridian design contests.</P>

<DL>
  <DT>Link</DT><DD>Missing our usual dire Greenhouse alarmism in this
  cheery, upbeat note?  Well, have a look at this:
  "The Global Warming Debate Is Over.  It's Real,
  Inexorable, and Headed Our Way"

<P><U>The Viridian Neologue Contest</U><BR>
<BR></P>

<P>Even supercomputers still can't "talk," because they
can't understand human language.  However, voice
recognition has made remarkable strides.
<BR></P>

<P>This opens a new possibility:  creating <STRONG>very 
small
fragments</STRONG> of human language for use with a <STRONG>small gizmo.</STRONG>
Forget the talking Coke machine or the robo-feminine seat-
belt warning.  Those crude applications merely  emitted
pre-recorded bursts of canned speech.   We now face the
prospect of newfangled gadgets that can <STRONG>listen to you</STRONG>
and mechanically respond.
<BR></P>

<P>These machines  would recognize certain words or brief
catch-phrases, and use them as an interface trigger.
<BR></P>

<P>They employ the  ISD-SR3000 Embedded Speech
Recognition Engine for command and control applications,
which was released in late 1999, and has so far found its
primary market niche in Panasonic cell phones.   However,
Viridian fellow-travellers from the legendary Bureau of
Inverse Technology have come into possession of a number
of these objects.  Hence our new contest:  finding
incredibly cool things for them to do.
<BR></P>

<P>These Recognition Engines are rather sophisticated
devices.  They respond to a spoken word or very short
phrase, and send along an electrical signal.  With the
proper wiring installed, this signal could activate pretty
much any switch, trigger, key, button, sensor, lever,
and/or actuator  on some already existing machine.  (As a
further plus, the chips can also emit human-sounding
speech!)
<BR></P>

<P>The Viridian Neologue Contest therefore asks the
cogent question: "When Things Start to Listen, what do you
say to them?"   Our aim in this design contest is to
invent feasible, verbal/mechanical situations that carry
this technology to fantastic, unheard-of, cyber-surreal
realms.
<BR></P>

<P>This is a <STRONG>conceptual art</STRONG> design contest. 
  You must
coin some imaginative word or short phrase, and briefly
describe its application to some real-world machine.  Your
phrase and its application should be so technically
insightful and so artistically striking that they
startlingly illuminate the vista of possibility opened by
this new variety of human/machine interaction.
<BR></P>


<P>Furthermore, as a special plus,  we plan to
<STRONG>actually make</STRONG> one of these babies, in a top-end academic
design lab on America's glamorous East Coast!  That's
right!  A Viridian Imaginary Product that <STRONG>actually
exists</STRONG> as a blobject d'art!</P>


<P>A few potential examples:
<BR></P>

<OL type=1 start=1 >
  <LI VALUE="1">
  State "bang," and fireworks go off downstairs.
  <BR><BR></LI>

  <LI VALUE="2">
  When your dog growls in a certain way, his collar says
  aloud, "I am your loyal servant."
  <BR><BR></LI>

  <LI VALUE="3">
  The building's elevator operates if you state 'Up' or
  'Down' == but only in correct, Castilian Spanish.
  <BR><BR></LI>

  <LI VALUE="4">
  The household lights flare up  when you clap your
  hands amid a racket of party noise, and  yell "Green Power
  Rules Okay!"
  <BR></LI>

</OL>

<P>Unlike most Viridian contests, this one requires no
webpage from participants.  All you need do is merely
email in a brief, cogent description of your concept and
its trigger word or phrase.  Nor is this a particularly
"green" contest.   Many green applications (such as #4)
obviously spring to mind, but our basic aim here is to
seriously stretch the public imagination and really blow
the doors off the baby-carriage of this infant technology.
<BR></P>


<P>Keep in mind that our eventual goal is here a working
proof-of-concept. This means a real, functional device,
which with any luck will really be created, with an
<STRONG>actual speech chip</STRONG> hardwired to some actual machine.  So
we want to stay in the realm of physical practicality
here, as opposed to sheer sci-fi freewheeling, such as
"Whenever I say,  'I'm bored,' a nuclear holocaust
ensues.'"   Oh yes, clearly that's theoretically possible
with this technology, but we're aiming for a design
installation, something that everyday people can really
touch and properly marvel at.
<BR></P>

<P>Consider yourself formally restricted to the lab
resources and bench-space realistically available to real-
life engineers at a real-life New York university.
<BR></P>

<P>This unique Viridian Contest comes complete with its
own judge, Dr Natalie Jeremijenko of the Center for
Advanced Technology, NYU.   Dr Natalie, who teaches
engineering and is an internationally known techno-artist,
is in possession of the hardware and a solder gun.  This
naturally makes her the Guest Viridian Pope-Empress for
this particular effort.  All her decisions will be final.
<BR></P>

<P>Some enlightening examples of her uniquely
Jeremijenkonian sensibility can be found at:

<P>People who enter a Viridian Contest receive a
valuable and prestigious star &lt;*&gt; for their log-in name.
<BR></P>

<P>The winner of the Viridian Neologue Contest receives a
fab digital notetaker with which to capture all those
inspired commands in their native medium.  It's an
ergonomically blobby Olympus V-90 Digital Voice Recorder!</P>

<P>This contest ends on Halloween,  October 31, 02000.  Good
luck!</P>
