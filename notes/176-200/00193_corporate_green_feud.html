<P>(((The Pew Climate people are not Viridian Green or khaki
green.  They are NGO corporate green.  Does this mean they
are mere profit-centric greenwashers?  An interesting
question, but one quickly answered by the stark fact that
the Global Climate Coalition fears them and hates their
guts.</P>

<P>(((The Pew Center, which hosts 22 corporate powerhouses
including BP, Shell and Enron, recently got some glowing,
softball coverage in The Economist ("the British poet
laureate of the WTO"). The GCC, sensing the challenge to
their self-declared turf as "the leading voice for
business in the climate debate," leapt swiftly to the
counterattack in the magazine's letters page.)))</P>

<DL>
  <DT>Source</DT><DD>The Economist, September 9, 02000
  (((This would be The Economist's all-too-insightful "Is
  Oil Poised to Strike?"  issue)))
  page 6
  </DD></DL>

<P>"Clearing the Air</P>

<P>"SIR == Your attempt to liken the Pew Centre on Global
Climate Change to the Global Climate Coalition is like
trying to compare apples and oranges.  (((More accurately,
it's like comparing an apple to a lump of coal.)))  The
Pew Centre has no membership dues and consists of 22
corporate members.  The GCC is supportedly broadly by a
cross-section of dues-paying American business groups and
recently expanded to represent collectively over 6m large,
medium and small businesses.  (((What an amazing bold lie!
The GCC is, of course, losing sponsorship right and left,
as we have repeatedly detailed in Viridian Notes 126, 140,
144, 148, etc.   The GCC's bald deceit takes your breath
away both literally and figuratively.)))
<BR></P>

<P>"It also seems that the Pew Centre has actually decided
that the GCC's long-held positions on the Kyoto treaty on
global warming were right all along.  Recently, the Pew
Centre's executive director called for renegotiating the
treaty because it is unworkable, as well as urging
countries to 'go slow and do it right.'  (((Of course they
both hate Kyoto.  That's a given: they're both corporate.
The basic disagreement between GCC and Pew is that one is
perfectly willing to fry the other's children in the
reckless pursuit of cash.)))
<BR></P>

<P>"For years, the leaders we represent have remained at
the forefront of research, design  (((yes, just like us,
the Global Climate Coalition is really a <STRONG>design</STRONG>
movement))) development and deployment of the new
technologies and voluntary actions that are already
addressing the issue of greenhouse gas  (((the GCC bottom
line == we want much, much more greenhouse gas))) without
massive mandated energy reductions.   (((Short of European
truckers on blockade, it's hard to find anybody in favor
of "massive mandated energy reductions.")))
<BR></P>

<P>"The GCC will continue to play a central role in
advancing common-sense solutions to climate policy."
(((Three lies in a single sentence == no advance, no
solution and no center!  I gotta grant that the GCC has
"policy," however  == they'll always fire a wad of soft-
money at anything that rises up over the parapet.)))
<BR></P>

<P>"Glenn Kelly, Executive Director GCC, Washington DC"</P>

<P>(((It's long been the Viridian Theory that the Global
Climate Coalition, which has covered itself with Lysenko-
style lies and ignominy, will eventually disband and start
a new, fully-sanitized front.  All their usual political
operatives will be quietly re-employed, but their tactics
will shift from straight-out greenhouse denial to new
approaches such as "oilimony" and "carbon amnesty."  These
tactics basically parallel those of the tobacco industry
and their lobbyists == "Tobacco won't hurt you; pay us to
stop making it; don't blame us for that cancer."
<BR></P>

<P>(((This month has seen the sudden and remarkably well-
financed arrival of a mysterious new entity calling itself
"Americans for Balanced Energy Choices."   This enterprise
is run from a post-office box in Virginia and owns the
website <A HREF="http://www.balancedpower.org/">www.balancedpower.org</A>.   We'll call them "Balanced
Power" for the time being, since they're clearly engaged
in a serious power-struggle, and, besides, "Energy
Choices" is a ridiculous name for them since they offer no
choice but coal.
<BR></P>

<P>(((Balanced Power, very interestingly, is using their
obviously very considerable funds to  stalk and pre-empt
the new BP "Beyond Petroleum" campaign.  (BP is a Pew
Centre supporter, and probably the world's loudest and
richest corporate-green entity.)  Whenever the computer-
animated BP "Helios" ad appears, Balanced Power inserts a
greenwash sunshine-and-daisy counter-ad, asserting that
electricity from coal is a wonderful, life-giving thing.
<BR></P>

<P>(((The Balanced Power website has no data at all about
who they are, where they come from, and who finances them,
other than a post-office box in Virginia.  However, there
are clever Viridians around who might figure them out, if
they could spare the attention.  (For instance, our recent
ability to spot utterly obscure, teenage Dutch fascists
was really impressive.)  We Viridians are therefore
ardently looking for the coal-smoking gun that links this
mysterious "Balanced Power" entity to (1) Global Climate
Coalition, (2) Greening Earth Society, and last but by far
most likely, (3) Fredrick Palmer of Western Fuels Corp,
"the Andrew Carnegie of Climate Denial."
<BR></P>

<P>(((Please send in your evidence, enlighten the rest
of us, and receive a lovely Viridian star!)))</P>
