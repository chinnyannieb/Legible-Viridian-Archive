<P>(((Here we have an interesting example of military
"khaki-green."  An armed global entity has shut down a
local industrial complex because it's too filthy  to be
allowed to run.  Someday coal mines and oil refineries
will also be championed by obstreperous, poverty-stricken,
criminalized local regimes == while the civilized world
coughs politely into a handkerchief and contemplates air
strikes.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(((It makes sense to interpret this maneuvering as a
harbinger of SO/LIC environmental health-war in a
Greenhouse world.  Note how the brain-damaging fumes of
lead have become a potent symbol of Serbian resistance.
Compare this to the strongly Green Serbian propaganda when
NATO bombed the Serbian energy infrastructure and toxic
fumes flew hither and yon from blazing oil refineries.
Whether you poison the locals or rescue them from poison,
it's a transparent and cynical plot either way!)))</P>

<P>"UN WARNS OF 'POISONING' FROM SERBIAN-RUN SMELTER IN
KOSOVA
A UN spokesman in Mitrovica said on 8 August that a
Serbian-run lead smelter is sending five times what the
WHO considers a 'very dangerous amount' of lead into the
air from the Trepca mining complex. The spokesman noted
that "the smelter plant is operating without proper
environmental and health controls. The fumes are not going
up the chimney, which has a converter, and instead they
are pumping raw residues over Zvecan and Mitrovica,'
Reuters reported.</P>

<P>"PEACEKEEPERS TAKE CONTROL OF MINING COMPLEX IN NORTHERN
KOSOVA
In the early hours of 14 August, some 800 KFOR troops
occupied the Serbian-run Trepca mining complex near
Zvecan. The UN recently reported that levels of lead
pollution and other forms of contamination from the plant
have reached 'very dangerous' levels.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"After the occupation of the mine, crowds of local
Serbs threw stones at peacekeepers, AP reported.
Unconfirmed reports suggest that some Serbian engineers
inside the mine may have barricaded themselves in their
offices. Bernard Kouchner, who is the UN's chief civilian
administrator for Kosova, said: 'As a doctor and as chief
administrator..., I would be derelict if I let this threat
to the health of children and pregnant women continue for
one more day.'</P>

<P>"SHARP SERBIAN REACTION TO UN TAKEOVER OF POLLUTING MINING
COMPLEX. Several hundred 'angry and confused' mainly
Serbian workers gathered outside the Trepca mining complex
on 15 August, AP reported. (...) Novak Bijelic, whom the
UN sacked as plant director, said that the 'fascist
takeover is aimed at destroying the company.' State-run
Serbian television argued that 'the obvious intention [of
UN chief administrator Bernard Kouchner] was to destroy
Trepca, which has become a symbol of Serbian resistance.'
Trepca was Kosova's largest single employer until the
conflict in 1999. The complex of about 40 mines produces
gold, silver, lead, zinc, and cadmium. It uses antiquated
technology, and pollution control devices are inadequate
or nonexistent." (...)
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"ANGRY SERBS PROTEST KOSOVA MINE TAKEOVER... Some
1,500 Serbs gathered on 16 August for the second day
outside the Trepca mine complex, which UN peacekeepers
have occupied to end environmental pollution from the
smelter. Milan Ivanovic, who is spokesman for the Serbs,
told AP that 'the takeover of Trepca is just part of the
strategy by [UN chief administrator Bernard] Kouchner and
the Albanians to ethnically cleanse Kosovo [of its
remaining Serbs]. We will not allow the Albanians in. All
those who worked here must continue to work.' (...)
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"KOUCHNER REASSURES SERBS. Speaking at the Trepca
complex on 16 August, Kouchner said that ending
environmental pollution at the complex is in everyone's
interest. 'This [Serbian] community will have to
understand that we will work for the benefit of all Kosovo
and Serbs as well. We are acting in the interests of the
Serbs,' AP reported. Kouchner stressed that 'it was
impossible to tolerate this pollution, because of...the
very high level of lead.... I don't know how long it will
take us to...[have] this place running, months perhaps.
This place is in desperate state, this is like the
nineteenth century.'"
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"UN DEFENDS MOVE AGAINST POLLUTION IN KOSOVA. UN
spokesman Manoel de Almeida e Silva said on 16 August in
New York that 'the levels of lead in the atmosphere [at
Trepca] were absolutely beyond any levels that are
acceptable. They are 200 times higher than what World
Health Organization recognizes, or sees as acceptable.' He
pointed out that the workers are being paid and that the
complex will reopen. 'It's all part of a larger project,
of course that takes time, to modernize and make that
entire complex more productive within modern norms of
environmental protection,' the spokesman said.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"BELGRADE WANTS UN MEETING ON KOSOVA MINE. Vladislav
Jovanovic, who is Serbia's chief diplomatic representative
at the UN, said in New York on 17 August that his
government demands that the Security Council condemn the
UN mission in Kosova's recent takeover of an
environmentally dangerous mining complex. Jovanovic
dismissed Kouchner's expressions of concern about lead
poisoning from the plant, calling his remarks 'another
cynical and transparent attempt to hoodwink world public
opinion and the Security Council,' AP reported."</P>
