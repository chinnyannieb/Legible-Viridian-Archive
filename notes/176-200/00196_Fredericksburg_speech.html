<P>"The Powerful Future of Texas"</P>

<P>Hi, glad to be here.  My name's Bruce Sterling, I'm
from Austin, I'm a science fiction writer.</P>

<P>You folks are probably wondering what a science
fiction writer is doing here in Fredericksburg, Texas.
Unless I miss my guess, nobody here asked to see a science
fiction writer.  Generally speaking, being a science
fiction writer, I'm <STRONG>never</STRONG> in a place where people expect
to see me.</P>

<P>Let me show you a nice solid for-instance here, so
you can see that I'm not just pulling all of this out of
my cowboy hat.   See this book of mine?  This is HACKER
CRACKDOWN, a nonfiction book that I wrote about computer
hackers.   I wrote this book ten years ago.  When I wrote
this, my publishers considered this computer-hacker stuff
to be a seriously futuristic topic.  My publishers like to
think that I'm ahead of my time, because that's why they
pay me.  So, sure, this book was pretty weird and wacky,
because it was all about guys who did amazing, incredible
stuff, like using computer networks to send each other
email.</P>

<P>This was back in 1990, so I had to explain to the
public what a modem was, and all that.  You may remember
those ancient days, if you're old enough.   "Information
Superhighway," and all that.   That was some mighty far-
fetched stuff, am I right?   Of course, nowadays, ten
years later,  people read this book and they consider it a
historical text.</P>

<P>So today, ten years later, you can't swing a cat in
my home town without whacking an Internet millionaire.
Society has definitely moved in that direction, and a
place that was once the future has become where it's at.</P>

<P>But it's not 1990, it's 2000.  So here I am in some
tent with weirdos who like windmills.</P>


<P>But why the town of Fredericksburg, you may well ask?
After all, if you're an author and journalist like I am,
and you want to hang out with green energy people, with
renewable energy people, a common destination is Denmark.
These Danish guys are getting a lot of press with their
wind-power thing.  These Danes are international wind-
patch roughnecks.  Some of them are even working in Texas.
If you happen to be a Danish wind-power guy out there in
the audience today, hey, I'm a major fan of you Danes.
Welcome to Texas.  You guys rock. Great furniture.  A
cheese Danish, that's a delicious pastry.</P>

<P>But I'm not in Denmark, I'm in Fredericksburg.   Now,
in order to explain to you why I am so passionately
devoted to the cause of this little festival, I have to
unburden myself of some  Texas history.   On my dad's
side, I'm a third-generation Texan.  And on my mother's
side == she was Valley people, from south of San Antonio
== I'm a seventh-generation Texan.  I am one small,
singular example of two huge Texan clans, with very
traditional Texan lineages in cattle-ranching and oil.
Even though I happen to be Mr Chrome-Plated Robots and
Rocketships here, I'm also an extremely native Texan.  I
am related by blood and marriage to probably half of this
state.</P>

<P>I also happen to live in your state's capital.  I
went  to the University there,  got married there,  had
two children there, and I built a house there.  I'm a very
ardent and patriotic Austinite.  Even to the point of
being slightly cranky about it, frankly.</P>


<P>Now ladies and gentlemen,  the big news in my home
town of Austin, your state's capital, is that the summer
of the year 2000 is finally over.   That was much bigger
news than the end of summer has ever been before.   A lot
of my fellow Austinites are already trying  very hard to
forget what happened to us in the evil summer of the year
2000.   Far be it from me to claim that us Austinites,
swilling our Starbucks coffee and kicking around in our
beatnik sandals, suffered any worse this summer than
Dallas, or Houston, or even glamorous Dime Box and
Muleshoe.   But I do need to share with you a kind of
executive summary of that summer, so that you can see what
propels a futurist into your little rodeo here.</P>


<P>This summer, Austin recorded the highest
temperatures ever seen in the history of the town.   It
was 110 degrees Fahrenheit on Labor Day.  That was a
brand-new weather record.   It has literally never been
that hot in the city of Austin, ever.   But that was by no
means all, because next day it was 112 degrees.   Last
summer,  Austin lived through over forty days with
temperatures over a hundred degrees.  Our lakes are forty
feet below normal.  Rivers, wells and streams have dried
up all over the area.    Plus, a drought all across Texas
has cost us about a billion dollars in agricultural
losses, so far.</P>

<P>Ladies and gentlemen, I didn't make any of this up.
It's amazing and astonishing, but this is not science
fiction.  Look at this, I took the trouble to bring you
some hard evidence.   This is the front page of our
newspaper, the Austin American-Statesman, for September 6,
2000, twenty-five days ago.   "One hundred twelve degrees
== a new extreme," this says.  "Power outages, wildfires
leave thousands in lurch."  This is not science fiction
about some possible Greenhouse Effect in Texas.  This is
the actual, no-kidding Greenhouse Effect in Texas.</P>

<P>Let me demonstrate to you the vital difference here
between predicting the future and living in it.  Because
I'm a science fiction writer,  I actually <STRONG>have</STRONG> some
science fiction about the Greenhouse Effect in Texas.  You
see this book?  This is a science fiction novel called
HEAVY WEATHER.  I wrote this book back in 1993.   <STRONG>Then</STRONG>
it was science fiction about the Greenhouse Effect in
Texas.  You didn't see much in the way of this newspaper
when I was writing this-here science fiction book.   But
we're sure seeing it now.  And like they say up in
Aggieland, wait till next year.</P>

<P>Nowadays, it's quite hard to find any issue of any
daily newspaper that doesn't have some kind of extreme
weather event mentioned in it.  Not necessarily in Texas,
of course.  Sometimes there is extreme weather in Mexico,
or Honduras, or Indonesia, or India, or Bangladesh.  Or
the North Pole, or the South Pole, or Switzerland, or
subsaharan Africa.  Pretty much all over, really.   I read
about bad weather, I've been interested in the science of
meteorology for quite a while, but I don't break into a
big sweat about every single newspaper report.  But I
surely do break into a big sweat when it's a hundred and
twelve degrees in my own front yard in Austin, Texas.
Because  if you don't sweat when you're in a hundred and
twelve degree heat, you die real fast.  Besides, that is
my home.</P>

<P>There's no big-deal surprise about this Greenhouse
Effect thing.  This is not a sudden, shocking event. This
has been a very slow, methodical trend which is easy to
follow if you're paying any attention.   The first time a
serious scientist wrote about the Greenhouse Effect, it
was back in the 1890s.  That was over a hundred years ago.
Climate experts were talking very seriously about this
stuff back in 1970, back in 1980.  It's not any big
surprise.  The only possible way to get all surprised
about this situation is to ignore it on purpose.</P>

<P>You can ignore it, and you always try to explain
away any particular episode of bad weather.   You can
always say it's just "freak weather," for instance.
Folks, this is the secret, okay?  In a Greenhouse Effect,
the freak weather <STRONG>is</STRONG> the normal weather.</P>

<P>I can understand why people would want to deny this,
and really go out on a limb to avoid facing the truth.
It's an unpleasant, scary thing to admit that the weather
is seriously acting up.  It's a  very hard thing to have
to tell to your kids, for instance  -- your kids <STRONG>are</STRONG> the
future, they're the ones who have to live there.</P>


<P>So unless I'm totally preaching to the converted
here, there's probably somebody out there who would like
to argue with me.  Maybe we can talk later. I've got a
table here, I'm hanging out at this jamboree right over
there,  next to the designer-gizmo collection, kinda doing
my Greenhouse Activist thing.</P>

<P>But let's not try to argue me out of it. Instead,  I
want you to imagine arguing <STRONG>yourself</STRONG> out of it.  Just
imagine yourself taking this newspaper from the year 2000
AD, back to the year 1980.   Just imagine showing this
newspaper to people walking around in the year 1980, you
know, guys with green hair and women in torn fishnet
stockings, and telling them, "See?  Look, here's a
newspaper from your future!  What do you think about
that?"</P>

<P>What do you think people from 1980 they would say if
they read this newspaper?  I'll tell you what they would
say.   "A hundred and twelve degrees!"  they would say.
"Good Lord, the Greenhouse Effect is kicking us from hell
to breakfast!"</P>

<P>Of course, once you're actually in the middle of a
Greenhouse Effect, it's a lot harder to say things like
that.  Because now that you're actually getting cooked in
your own home, you have to feel that it's like, somehow,
<STRONG>your own fault.</STRONG>  All of a sudden you find yourself
saying things like, "Uh, maybe all this climate change
thing is just alarmism," and "Gee, don't let those people
from Kyoto tax us," and "Oh my gosh, I sure am paying a
lot for this gasoline."</P>

<P>These are perfectly natural things to want to say,
so a lot of people are saying them.   The only problem is
that you're also forced to say other things, much uglier
and scarier things,  like "Man, I sure do wish it would
rain," and "Hey, all the peach trees in my lawn just
died," and "Wow, my Grandma just had a heat stroke on the
way from her house to her car."</P>

<P>I know this seems kinda scary, but this part is not
the scary part.    This is the <STRONG>early</STRONG> part of the 21st
century.  All of the <STRONG>big</STRONG> stuff lies ahead of us.    The
scary part comes when we imagine a guy from the year 2020
showing up here with <STRONG>his</STRONG> newspaper.   Because if he's
breaking this year's heat records, if he's breaking this
year's drought records, then Texas is in a very different
and very unpleasant  world.</P>

<P>Ladies and gentlemen, Texas is my home.  This place
is where I take my stand.   That was my homeland and my
front yard baking in September 2000 at a hundred and
twelve degrees.  That is not something I am prepared to
passively accept.</P>

<P>Now, ladies and gentlemen, let me take a moment to
talk about this global climate problem from a strictly
Texan perspective.   Never mind El Nino, and emissions
rates, and the Kyoto Treaty, and the ozone layer, and
isobars, and all that.   Instead, I would like to talk a
little bit about our regional character as a people, about
who we Texans are.  I know this isn't strictly a
politically correct thing to do in a sophisticated era of
high-speed  globalism, but this is Fredericksburg, so I
think maybe I can get away with it, if I thicken my drawl
and visit a spell with my own neighbors.</P>

<P>Well, it's no use judging us by imaginary standards of
absolute perfection.  Let's face it, even Denmark looks
pretty bad in those circumstances.   What kind of people
are we?  What should we properly expect of ourselves?
We're not New York, we're not California.  But that's not
our problem; that only looks like our problem if you hail
from one of those other places.</P>

<P>We Texans need to be properly seen in our own
context.   In order to be understood as a people, we
Texans need to be compared to the people who are closest
to us, our nearest and dearest neighbors, the people of
our own world locale, the people who share some of our own
history and our own values and our heritage.  In other
words, Louisiana and Mexico.  Louisiana and Mexico: two
places I cherish, ladies and gentlemen.  Looking at them
never fails to cheer me right the heck up.</P>

<P>Those are our two true peers as societies.  They are
the proper scale of comparison: how do us Texans make out,
compared to Louisiana and Mexico?  Well, if you go to New
Orleans or Mexico City, and talk to those fine people
about Texans, and what their neighbors the Texans are
really like, you get a remarkable portrait.</P>


<P>You get the firm impression that Texans are
incredibly rich, smart, energetic people.  Texans  have
wads of money and keen business sense.  People in New
Orleans are convinced that Texans have bought up pretty
much everything in New Orleans worth buying. In fact,
there's a haze of Texan imperialism that stretches way out
to Colorado, where there are guys who dress like John
Denver wandering around in their mountains wondering why
Texans get to use all their snow.</P>

<P>So ladies and gentlemen, while I regret my native
state's various political and cultural shortcomings, such
as our widely-noted illiteracy, poverty and prison rates,
you're not going to see me leaving Texas and writing my
books somewhere else.  Expecially when our congenial
Governor may become President and his charming wife is a
librarian.
<BR></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Now let me invite you to take a closer look at this</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>very alarming Texan newspaper.  Let's forget this
terrifying headline up here, because that's only the
obvious part.   Instead, let's look down at this lower
front-page headline.  It's in smaller print, so I'll have
to read it aloud to you.  It says: "Tech Trio from Austin
Among '40 Richest Under 40.'"</P>

<P>What is this article about?  Well, this would be
Fortune magazine's list of the richest people in America.
Who have we got here?  Since this is Texas-rich,  I'd be
guessing these must be semi-literate cattle barons, or
maybe country folk-singers of some kind... But no, this
would appear to be Mr. Michael Dell of Dell Computer, Mr.
Joe Liemandt of Trilogy Software, and Mr. Navdeep Sooch,
the co-founder and chief executive of Silicon Laboratories
Incorporated.</P>

<P>This is an interesting newspaper page, because if you
put these two articles together, it strongly implies that
Texans are in a position to do something useful and
creative about our situation.  We're not at death's door
here.  We're not selling apples and begging for nickels.
Texas is rich!  We're in the midst of a massive economic
boom.   The United States has been in a bull market since
1982 that has a fifteen percent a year rate of return.</P>

<P>Major industries are reinventing themselves all
around us.  Cities are reinventing themselves all around
us.  Your capital city is a vast mess of cranes and trench
diggers, with Help Wanted signs in every window and people
pouring in around the clock.</P>

<P>We're rich, we're high tech, we're fast and smart,
and yet we're roasting ourselves and our children in our
own exhaust fumes.  Ladies and gentlemen, those two
situations just don't add up.</P>

<P>There's a new business model due.   And I'm thinking
Texas may be just the place for it.  When it comes to
energy, we Texans have an often overlooked,  but rather
important advantage.   Because when it comes to the energy
business, we Texans actually know what we are talking
about.   Unlike  people who theorize about energy, we have
lived there.  Texas is not the kind of state where you
just write an indignant letter to the editor and some
energy mysteriously appears.  Around here, you roll up
your sleeves and you dig down into the dirt.</P>

<P>Folks, a serious energy business is a tough,
complicated, hands-on enterprise.  Houston has a lot of
rich people.  You may have noticed that Houstonians dress
much better than us Austinites.  They have a lot of lovely
things like theaters, museums and designer gowns.   Do you
think those rich people in Houston want to live in the
most polluted city in the USA?  They're not breathing that
smog  because they enjoy it.  They're doing it because
Houston is a huge refinery metropolis.  Houstonians didn't
build all those gas flares and catalytic cracking units
just to gratify themselves.   Those aren't ornamental
structures.   Those are huge industrial enterprises run by
some of the biggest megacorporations on earth.</P>

<P>The Spindletop oil field came in in 1901.  It has
taken us Texans one hundred long years to create the vast
energy infrastructure in Texas.  People didn't do this by
accident.  It took hard work and even genius to do this to
ourselves.  It took Thomas Edison to do this, to turn day
into night with electricity.  It took Henry Ford to give
people mass mobility.  And it took John D. Rockefeller to
create the financial and distribution infrastructure of
what is still the mightiest industrial enterprise in the
world.
<BR></P>

<P>If all those refineries in Houston shut down
tomorrow, all the people in Houston will breathe a lot
easier, and some people in Houston will lose a whole lot
of money.  But if those refineries in Houston shut down,
people in New England will freeze in the dark.</P>

<P>I know our friends in New England have got some
energy.  They've got some nuclear plants that they're
really afraid of, and they've got some nice little
renewable hydroelectric dams that must be 300 years old.
It's not their fault that the energy business is not a
core regional enterprise.  We've got a serious maple-syrup
shortage here in Texas. I'm sure the two of us can find
some way to do business.   My point is that it is no  easy
thing to build a professional, reliable, national-scale
energy infrastructure.   Energy is a serious matter of
physics and engineering, energy isn't made from wishful
thinking, crystal balls and pixie dust.  It's hard work,
it's serious, it takes real skill and investment.  And,
for all of the twentieth century, the energy business has
been really dirty and actively dangerous.</P>

<P>I happen to be a major enthusiast for clean renewable
energy.  But I like to approach this matter Texas-style.
That's why I am an energy industry booster.  I'm not under
any illusion that renewable energy is gonna happen merely
because I stand here yakking about it.   Renewable energy
is going to happen because there is going to be a huge,
powerful, renewable energy industry.  That new system has
to rip up the old fossil system root and branch, and
replace that vast dirty machine with a vast new clean
machine,  around the entire world.   There is no other way
to succeed.</P>

<P>This must be made to happen in real life on a titanic
scale.  Energy is not imaginary.  Energy is what
physically happens whenever you reach out and turn Henry
Ford's ignition key.  It's what physically happens
whenever you reach out and flick Thomas Edison's light
switch. They called John Rockefeller a "Titan" because his
enterprise was titanic.  Energy is billions of real people
doing common things billions of time every day.
<BR></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Today, whenever most folks use energy, there is a puff</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>of smoke somewhere.    In a car, that smoke pours out
right behind you.  With a light bulb, the smoke puffs up a
smokestack somewhere miles away.  We Texans did it
ourselves.  Since 1901, we dug up millions of barrels from
the soil of Texas and sold it and burned it.  That is why
the hot summer sky frowned upon us in the year 2000.  That
is why the stars at night are no longer bright deep in the
heart of Texas.
<BR></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Renewable energy isn't magic.  It's energy.  If it were</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>easy, we would have done it during the first oil shock in
the 1970s, instead of hanging around waiting for the
latest one.   We Texans are taking a beating from oil
prices just like everybody else.   Texas used to get rich
off oil.  Some Texans still get rich off oil.  But  Texas
is losing  big money, because in the year 2000, Texans
import more oil than we export.  We crossed over in the
early 1990s.   We subsidize our own renewables a little
bit, but we're real, real busy subsidizing OPEC.  We've
become a net energy importing state, just like our fellow
Americans in the states of New England.   At the prospect
of a shortfall in oil or a price spike in natural gas, we
Texans have to get that same panicky look as everyone
else.   That's a very strange look for Texans to have.  I
don't like that look very much.  I don't think that look
belongs on our faces.</P>

<P>Renewable energy cannot be judged by imaginary
standards of absolute perfection.  Renewable energy has to
be compared to its own neighbors, the industries that
share its heritage: coal, oil, and nuclear.   Big, hard,
tough enterprises.  You're not doing energy people any
favors  when you pretend that sustainable energy is simple
and easy.    This is wrongheaded, because you are telling
them that they have no skills and no understanding, that
the modern energy situation is just an accident.  The
people of Texas spent  a hundred years, five generations,
arranging this accident.  It was a very big job.</P>

<P>One of the things outsiders tend to notice about
Texas is that we have pipelines all over the place.
Commonly they blow up and fry people.  Those pipelines
didn't grow there by themselves like poison ivy.   They
exist to move energy from place to place, and for no other
reason.  Energy is a patchy resource.   All energy is
always patchy.    If it's liquid, like oil, you've got to
move it in a pipe.  If it's voltage, like wind, you have
to build transmission towers.   If it's nuclear, you have
to dig it up somewhere, and  then you have to really,
really wonder where to put the garbage when you're done.</P>

<P>Big wind is big.   We've never seen wind as big as
wind has got to get if wind power takes a serious bite out
of oil and nuclear.   The blades of a windmill get more
efficient when they sweep out a big radius, a big windmill
gets more energy out of the breeze that way.  That is a
law of physics, you can't change that by holding your
breath.</P>

<P>We're talking wind derricks here.    We're talking
industrial installations on the scale of offshore oil
rigs.  We're talking a forest of whirring, moaning steel
the like of which the world has never seen.   We're
talking major capital investments with large cadres of
welders, and pipefitters, and expert managers.</P>

<P>If you put all that hardware in downtown Boston,
people would get all stuffy about it.  But I think we  can
put it in Texas and deal with it.  Why?  Because it's a
hundred times cleaner and safer than the energy
infrastructure that we already built!   It's no use trying
to scare us about windmills, because we live next door to
giant reservoirs of liquefied petroleum gas!</P>

<P>Solar is patchy, too.  I happen to have some solar
on my house.  I've got solar photovoltaic, a bunch of big
panels the size of movie posters.  I've had them up on my
roof for about six months now, and in that time, I've
produced about 3 megawatt-hours of whoop-te-do clean green
renewable energy.   Solar photovoltaic is a technology
that I live with intimately now.   I can literally see it
in my own back yard.   I'm so proud of those silicon
gizmos that my friends snicker about it behind my back.</P>

<P>"Imagine a world where energy is so clean it causes
zero pollution and so simple you hardly know it's there."
It sounds really good, doesn't it?  But I didn't say that.
An oil company said that.  You can read it on their
website.</P>

<P>But folks, that's still technology, that's not magic.
When the sun sets in Austin Texas, God makes it set burnt
orange, but the sun still sets every day.  There's no such
thing as <STRONG>lunar</STRONG> energy.</P>

<P>Solar can get cheaper than it is, solar can get more
efficient, and it wouldn't kill us if a solar panel was a
much sexier and more attractive consumer item, either.
But the earth is not gonna stop turning on its axis just
because us clean energy enthusiasts might find that
convenient.  The sun over Austin is not gonna stop setting
just because austinenergy.com == a fine, upstanding outfit
== got me some nice, quiet, clean solar panels that can
turn Texas sunlight into voltage.</P>

<P>My profound hope is that the people of Texas, who
have suffered and struggled with an energy business for
100 years,  can deal with  facts of life like this.
That Texans can lead the way  into a new energy industry
by finding the will, the courage, the persistence and the
skill to carry out the necessary actions to free ourselves
from a dead technology.   And I don't want us to do this
out of the goodness of our hearts, either.  I want us to
do this for the same reason we always did it:  because it
pays.</P>

<P>Where else are the American people going to look for
energy solutions?  California is a likely candidate.  We
Texans have a lot in common with Californians.  We're both
nice big states, we both have politicians who really
hanker to be President, and when it comes to high-tech
ingenuity, the great state of California is truly second
to none.  Both Texas and California, I might add,
underwent extensive reform of their energy utilities.
California in 1996, Texas lagging along in 1999.</P>

<P>Unfortunately for my good friends in Silicon Valley,
however, California's energy policy is a dreadful mess.
They had a massive heat wave in the summer of 2000 just
like we did, but while they were running those air
conditioners, they somehow forgot to build enough new
capacity.   So California has been pestered by rolling
brownouts and tremendous cost spikes.  In fact, California
was so petrified by the awful summer of 2000 that they
have launched one of their famous consumer revolts.
Pacific Gas and Electric has lost 2.2 billion dollars
since June.  Utility bills tripled in San Diego.   Other
people,  their neighbors in Nevada for instance, are
looking over their border at the shining example of
California, and saying: oh well, there's just no way.</P>

<P>This is not merely an American problem.   Consider
the grand examples of France and Britain this summer.
Britain, which pumps a lot of oil out of the North Sea,
nevertheless has a very progressive fuel tax.  France and
Britain had a lot of high-minded attempts to politically
impose some stern energy discipline from on high.
France buckled under in a big hurry.  A little later, two
thousand angry truck drivers were able to bring Britain to
its knees.   Britain and France just had a good old
fashioned, cars-round-the-block energy crisis, 1970s
style.  Hospitals shutting down, mail not getting
delivered, oh brother.  Germany had big problems, too.</P>

<P>Then there's Texas.  We also had utility reform.  We
had some price hikes.  However, you may have noticed that
the people of Texas have not taken to the streets.  We had
our share of summer brownout scares, but nowhere near as
bad as California's.   We also have the most ambitious
renewable energy program in the nation.  We were supposed
to have 2000 megawatts of clean power on line by 2009.
We're probably gonna have that done by 2002.</P>

<P>How did this happen?  Well, it's about two things,
basically:   a well-crafted  renewable energy requirement,
and non-discriminatory  electricity transmission rules.
Those two things sound pretty obscure.  You're not gonna
see anybody running around with protest signs demanding
those things.  They don't get a lot of spin from political
commentators on television.</P>

<P>Nevertheless, that is what it takes in the real world.
In other words, somebody has to tell utilities to do clean
energy, and then, somebody has to see that utilities
actually pay for the juice that they get.  This doesn't
sound all that complicated.  However, we Texans seem to be
the only people in America who are really pulling it off.</P>

<P>We're not going broke doing this.   This is not some
free-market interference thing.  There is no free market
in energy:  OPEC is a cartel.  That's a non-issue.  The
people of Texas have scarcely noticed the change, even
though it's a big success.  This renewables thing isn't a
big stinking partisan issue here.  Our Republican Governor
signed that bill.  He's an oil man, so I guess that is
supposed to make any act of energy reform completely
impossible, but people, this is Texas.  We're all oil
people here.</P>

<P>Oil was our state's industrial base for 100 years.
There's scarcely a single native Texan  who didn't have
friends, relatives, loved ones in some aspect of the oil
business.   When we can also say that about the wind
business, and the solar business, and the biomass
business, then we will have won.  That is the Texan
victory condition.  It doesn't require a panic, and a
crisis, and the politics of personal destruction.  It just
needs good sense and a steady hand.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>I'm from Austin.   In Austin we have something called</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>the Austin Green Choice program.  When I pay for
electricity, I don't pay for any coal, oil or even
nuclear.  I only buy wind, solar and biomass.  I used to
pay a five dollar premium a month for this.  Five whopping
dollars for renewable energy, ladies and gentlemen.  Of
course, that was before OPEC started getting antsy this
season.  Now there's been a big price spike in natural
gas.  That means I am currently spending $1.37 a month for
all-green power.   A dollar thirty-seven, folks.  I would
scorn to leave that kind of money as a tip.</P>

<P>This isn't some amazing run-around here. Nobody had
to bend over like a  pretzel to make this happen in
Austin.   We have the cheapest green energy in the United
States, and people in the rest of Texas, and America,
don't even know that's possible.   It's plenty possible.
I'm doing it right now.  So are IBM and Apple in Austin.
You can sign up for it on-line.  It's the way forward.</P>

<P>I don't think oil companies are inherently evil.  I
think oil was a necessary technical step.  My own father
worked for an oil company.  I am a child of the Texan oil
industry.  Oil put food on my table.  Oil bought me my
shoes, and put a roof over my head.  Oil got me a first-
class college education at a first-class oil-supported
university.    I know what oil looks like.  I grew up on
the Gulf Coast in the 1950s, when the smog used to rot
screens off windows and peel paint off the cars.   Oil
also gave me a life of education and privilege that made
possible the life I enjoy today.</P>

<P>If it hadn't been for my father's Texan oil
industry, I probably would have worked in my grandfather's
industry instead:  ranching and farming.  I am a rancher's
grandson and an oil man's son.   Folks, I know what
ranching looks like.  I'm up here shaking books and
newspapers at you, but I've dug postholes.  I've branded
cattle.  I've strung barbed wire and cut back cedar and
croton weed and stinging nettle. I've seen ranchers
struggle and suffer with Texas weather, which has always
been harsh and punitive, but never like it is today.  I
fully understand why my Dad spent his youth doing ranch
work, and why he left as soon as he could to go to college
and work in oil.</P>

<P>But my father is gone now, and both my grandfathers
are gone, but Texas is still here.   The land of this
great state was here before we dug up any oil, and it's
gonna be here long, long after we stop.   The question is
badly do we mistreat it, how badly do we abuse it, how
badly do we sell out our kids and betray our heritage in a
false loyalty to a dying industry.   I'm an oil company
kid through and through, but I know what's coming to us if
we try to stretch the 20th century into the middle of the
21st.  It is unconscionable.  I just refuse to do it.  No
more!  I won't cooperate!  I won't collaborate!</P>

<P>And most directly to the point:  <STRONG>I won't pay.</STRONG></P>

<P>When my dad went from the farm to the factory, that
was part of a huge industrial change that Texas was
undergoing.  He didn't have to be chased there by force of
arms.  When we move out of the old smokestacks and into
the new sustainable networks, with any kind of luck,
nobody much will notice.   I've got every kind of grudge
against the use of coal and oil.  I think it's foul, it's
backwards, and it's poisonous.   But I got nothing at all
against energy companies.  On the contrary, I think
they're kind of cute.  I'm a big fan.  I'm here waving
pompoms.</P>

<P>My Dad used to work for Amoco Oil.  They were good
to him, he was a loyal employee.   There is no  Amoco now.
There's a successor company that bought Amoco.  It's a
global company that's run by a British guy,  called "BP."
It used to be British Petroleum.  There is no more British
Petroleum, either.  It's just "BP" now.  Or, as they like
to call themselves, "Beyond Petroleum."
<BR></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>Sometimes I hear from environmental activists who think</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>these BP guys are kidding when they say that they plan to
go "beyond petroleum."  When they say that they're the
biggest solar company in the world.   Because after all,
they're oil people.  Which can only mean oil then, oil
now, oil forever.  These critics are wrong.  These are
guys so used to defeat, so blinkered, that they've
forgotten how to recognize a victory.   They're fanatical
and stodgy, they don't get it.  BP <STRONG>is</STRONG> the biggest solar
company in the world.   BP's <STRONG>gas stations alone</STRONG> are one
of the biggest solar markets in the world.  BP can be a
huge renewables outfit just selling solar <STRONG>to itself.</STRONG></P>

<P>When you tell certain people this fact of life, they
get that stunned look on their face.   "But isn't there
something incredibly ironic about a gas station running on
solar energy?"  Who <STRONG>cares</STRONG>?  Irony isn't the problem.
I'm a novelist: I can give you irony by the truckload, all
the irony you can eat.  The sky is full of greenhouse
gases, it's not full of irony.</P>

<P>I'm not a Greenhouse activist because I despise and
fear oil companies.  I'm a Greenhouse activist because I'm
the <STRONG>adult survivor</STRONG> of a <STRONG>dead</STRONG> oil company.  I 
<STRONG>like</STRONG>
the idea of Texan energy companies.  I think that people
around Fredericksburg ought to be wealthy wind moguls.  A
guy gets kind of tired of looking at rich oil sheiks for
thirty years, it just gets monotonous.  They got plenty of
sun and sand in the Mideast.  Let 'em build solar cells,
like we do.</P>

<P>I got one more thing to show you before I leave.</P>

<P>Look at this shirt.  See this cool black T-shirt I'm
wearing?   Like a lot of Austinites, I take my fashion
cues from the West Coast. That is why I'm wearing an
environmentalist T-shirt from San Francisco. It's from
"PlaNetwork," the conference for "Planetary Ecology and
Digital Technology."  I wish I could stop and explain to
you how incredibly hip and with-it this PlaNetwork thing
was, but there's just no time.  Suffice it to say that
Julia Butterfly was there, and Butterfly was knocking 'em
dead.</P>

<P>Now look at this other, cool black T-shirt.  This is
the new BP t-shirt.  It goes along with their new ad
campaign, the one with the fantastic new green computer
logo.</P>

<P>Now, I'm going to change the handsome black T-shirt
I'm wearing, for this energy company black T-shirt.  I
want you to watch me as literally pull the shirt right off
my back here, and put on this other one. I want you to
tell me if you see any real, substantive difference in the
way I look or behave after this experience.  I want you
folks to tell me if the sudden contradiction is somehow
just too much for you.  Let me know if your head explodes
or anything, okay?  (((Speaker changes shirts.)))</P>

<P>Nice shirt, huh?</P>

<P>That's all I have to say, ladies and gentlemen.
Thank you for your kind indulgence.</P>
