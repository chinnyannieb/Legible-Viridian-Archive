<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The thick ice that has for ages covered the Arctic
Ocean at the pole has turned to water, recent visitors
there reported yesterday. At least for the time being, an
ice-free patch of ocean about a mile wide has opened at
the very top of the world, something that has presumably
never before been seen and is more evidence that global
warming may be real and already affecting climate."  John
Noble Wilford, The New York Times, Saturday, August 19,
2000</P>

<P>(((We Viridians have been looking for the "Rock Hudson of
the Greenhouse Effect" for some time now.  To judge by
Viridian email submissions, open water at the North Pole
is the most compelling evidence yet.  "The North Pole has
melted."  This assertion is hard to downplay, though no
doubt the Greening Earth Society will bend every well-
financed effort.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(((There's quite a lot going on this month,
weatherwise.  The American West is extensively on fire,
with firefighting teams  collapsing from fatigue.  A lab
report came out declaring that ragweed, a notorious
allergen, is twice as productive of irritating pollen
thanks to increased CO2.  This ominous report implies that
most every plant on this planet may have been sexually
affected by the Greenhouse Effect.  We can expect  untold
demographic effects down the line.  There were 160-mile an
hour wind gusts in Taipei yesterday from the anomalously
huge and violent "Super-Typhoon Bilis", which is making
landfall now on the densely populated coast of China.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(((There is a temptation to despair when events this
egregious happen to us, yet there is no detectable
response from the powers-that-be.  But keep this in mind:
this ugliness is as nothing compared to what lies ahead.
We are early in the 21st century's developmental curve.
These events are dire harbingers, like bloodshot eyes and
trembling hands == but the trend means  cirrhosis, violent
blackouts and Korsakoff's Syndrome. So far, we've got it
easy.   The day will surely come when everyone knows.
Then our dilettante hobby becomes history, and serious
work ensues
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(((Best news of the month:  the fabulous Viridian logo
of "BP", aka "Beyond Petroleum."  Though America is
running two Texan oil men for President and Vice
President, Sir John Browne's British-based multinational
has sacrificed the jargon term "British" in exchange for a
globalist Green Party sunflower logo.   The BP television
ads in the USA, establishing their new corporate-identity
scheme, are  marvelous.   You could easily mistake this
massive, ancient energy company for a go-getting dot-com.
Despite stiff competition from Shell ("Shell Wind, Shell
Solar") BP has to be known henceforth as the Viridian
darling among oil companies.   If you live in Chicago, we
Viridians would be very interested in an eye-witness
report from a BP <STRONG>solar-powered gas station.</STRONG>  We are also
eager to own a BP Sunflower T-shirt.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(((Before you dismiss BP's greenwashing as some
ludicrous oxymoron, ask yourself this:  why are you
emptying your wallet at some gas station that is  <STRONG>not
solar powered?</STRONG>
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(((Many Viridians sent in email about John Noble
Wilford's New York Times article describing open water at
the North Pole.  Mirian Lennox suggested an activist
response.)))</P>

<P>"This may be the most important Viridian news story yet,
in that it's the first incontrovertible evidence of global
warming which can be plainly seen by the naked eye and
understood by the layman.  I suggest a broad marketing
campaign centered around this event, complete with
Viridian Polar Ice Cubes (clear plastic cubes filled with
salt water) and, just in time for the holiday season 'A
Viridian Green Christmas,' in which Santa is forced to
abandon his toymaking factory for a houseboat.  The
kiddies will love it!"</P>
