<P>"For the second straight day, heat makes history in Austin</P>

<P>"Power outages, wildfires leave thousands in lurch</P>

<P>by Jason Spender, Austin-American staff</P>

<P>"Wildfires roared, paramedics scrambled and football
games were cancelled Tuesday while Central Texas baked
under the hottest temperatures ever recorded."</P>

<P>(((You can tell this is Texan journalism because of those
football games.)))</P>

<P>"Austin's high of 112 degrees erased Monday's record
of 110 degrees, leaving even the professionals grasping
for adjectives.</P>

<P>"'This is crazy,' said meteorologist Robert Blaha of the
National Weather Service."</P>

<P>(((Austin's TV weathermen were even more tongue-tied,
though their grasping for adjectives somehow never lit
on the useful modifier, "Greenhouse.")))
<BR></P>

<P>"No US city was hotter Tuesday, although New Braunfels,
Cotulla and Hondo matched Austin's 112."  (((Luckless
Round Rock, home of Dell Computer, was 113 back
on Monday, however.)))
<BR></P>

<P>"More than 60 wildfires burned at least 8,000 acres
across Texas, including a Bastrop County wildfire that
destroyed two homes and a 1,600-acre blaze near Kerrville</P>
<!-- Automatically detected CODE sample -->
<PRE>
that forced the evacuation of 300 houses and businesses."
(((It's much, much cooler today == merely in the mid-90s
== but we haven't yet touched on the issue of this
summer's Texan droughts and the consequent wildfires.)))
</PRE>
<!-- end of automatically detected CODE sample -->
<BR>

<P>"Austin's demand for electricity set records and
burned out a transfomer, leaving 4,000 customers without
power in the afternoon heat."  (((Today Austin blew out a
second transformer, blacking-out a different 5,000 people,
though only for two hours.  Thanks for averting massive</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>civilian casualties, austinenergy.com.)))<BR>
<BR>
"Water use rose to levels not seen since mandatory<BR>
restrictions began == prompting water officials to keep<BR>
the restrictions in place at least until October." (...)<BR>
<BR>
"Air conditioners churned all day Tuesday as Austin<BR>
residents consumed a record 2,300 megawatts of electricity<BR>
== the fifth new record this summer.<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<BR>

<P>"'The system is going to a point it's never been to
before,' power company spokesman Ed Clark said.
<BR></P>

<P>"At times, the utility was pushed beyond its limits.
About 4,000 homes and businesses along MoPac Boulevard
(Loop 1) in Northwest Austin lost electricity when an
overburdened transformer blew out at 3:30 pm, Clark said.
Most had their power restored within an hour.   Ten
transformers gve out Monday, leaving 6,000 customers
temporarily without power, Clark said. (...)  (((This
makes no distinction between those little pole
transformers, which blow like popcorn in high heat, and
the big ground stations.  The big one that blew also took
out the local traffic signals, leading to a scary snarl of
traffic, in deadly heat, quite near my neighborhood.)))
<BR></P>

<P>"Utilities in Houston and Dallas were ordered to
divert service from some commercial customers to make up
for a statewide shortfall, said Tom Noel, chief executive
officer of the Taylor-based Electric Reliability Council
of Texas.  (((California, here we come.)))
<BR></P>

<P>(...) "Firefighting crews from Georgia, South
Carolina and Florida are in Texas to fight a growing
number of wildfires" (...)  (((I'd like to assure
newcomers to Texas that Texas didn't used to be like
this.)))
<BR></P>

<P>(((The weather toll to date this summer:  40 days of
100+ temperatures, seven consecutive days of record-
setting heat.   The drought is severe as well, and far
from over.  Forecasters predict no rains till October and
everything not irrigated is well and truly parched.  It's</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>been comical to watch the weather coverage over the past<BR>
seven days == TV weatherpeople been missing their<BR>
temperature marks by a country mile.  One has to suspect<BR>
that their algorithms are somehow outdated.<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<BR>

<P>(((I would not suggest you come to Austin this month;
we're really not our usual raffish, dewy, River City
selves.  Personally, I'm heading for San Francisco this
weekend, for a refreshing change of blackouts.  However,
weekend after next, it's party time!   I'm hosting a
writer's conference here at the Viridian Vatican.  We'll
have the traditional house party afterward, on the night
of the 16th.  Do let me know if you'd care to drop by.  We
long-suffering Austinites will have all the jolly
camaraderie of Britons in a Blitz shelter, plus some free
beer.)))</P>
