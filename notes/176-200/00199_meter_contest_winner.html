<P>Attention Conservation Notice:  Someone just got $5,000
for designing a Viridian Imaginary Product, but it
wasn't you.</P>

<P>(((The "Wattbug" is the first emanation of the Viridian
Movement that might become a real-life, commercially
available consumer product.  We Viridians didn't plan on
this development, and we scarcely did any of the work, but
that makes us all the more pleased that it's going on.
Furthermore, we plan to <STRONG>buy</STRONG> one! Maybe a whole bunch of
them! We'll even pay retail!)))</P>

<P>WINNERS ANNOUNCED

<P>FIRST INTERNATIONAL
VIRIDIAN DESIGN COMPETITION
OCTOBER 2000
SUSTAINABILITY INSTITUTE</P>

<HR NOSHADE ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="46%">

<P>Dear Contestants, Judges, and Supporters
of the First International Viridian Design Competition,</P>

<P>We at Sustainability Institute's Arts &amp; Culture program
are pleased to  announce that the Competition has
successfully concluded, and we have a  winner.  The web
address for the announcement appears below.</P>

<P>The winning design, the "Wattbug," was created by the
design team of Inci  Mutlu, Suleyman Erdogan, and Safak
Emrence, of Istanbul, Turkey.  They  receive a first prize
of $5,000.</P>

<P>The second round judges == who were all those in
attendance at the 19th  Meeting of the Balaton Group in
Csopak, Hungary == were so impressed by the  quality of
the finalist submissions that four Runners Up were chosen
to receive $500 each; and the remaining five finalists
were all named Honorable  Mentions and awarded $200.</P>

<P>We are now beginning to publicize the results of the
competition, with the  help of Henry Griggs, a public
relations consultant with expertise in energy  out of
Washington, DC.  Viridian Movement founder Bruce Sterling
will also be  announcing the results at a design
conference hosted by WIRED magazine this  weekend.  (Your
help in spreading the word about the Competition results
would be greatly appreciated.  We think it will make a
great feature story.)</P>

<P>The complete Competition results have now been posted at
the Sustainability  Institute website, <A HREF="http://www.sustainer.org/">www.sustainer.org</A>.

<P>(Those of you in the Competition, please check to make
sure that the details are correct for the information
posted with your submission.  Click on your submission's
picture to go to the page with your information.  Send any
corrections to Diana Wright at
<A HREF="mailto:diana.s.wright@dartmouth.edu">diana.s.wright@dartmouth.edu</A>)</P>

<P>Checks will be mailed to winners within a week.</P>


<P>The winning design will be introduced to a variety of
potential manufacturers, but all finalists are encouraged
to pursue their ideas.  There is room for more than one
Viridian Electricity Meter in the market.</P>

<P>Sponsoring this Competition was a thoroughly satisfying
experiment, and we hope you will consider also
participating in the Second International Viridian Design
Competition, which we intend to sponsor either in 2001 or
2002.</P>

<P>With congratulations to our winner, runners up, and
honorable mentions, and thanks to all who participated in
making this Competition not only a success, but a lot of
fun.</P>
