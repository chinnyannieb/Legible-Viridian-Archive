Subject: Re: Viridian Note 00183: North Pole Melts<BR>

"Bruce,<BR>
"Re your enthusiasm about 'bp' (note the lower case ==<BR>
apparently official, though  of course everyone will<BR>
continue to use capitals).  I have to say 'yes, but...',<BR>
as there is certainly an element of style triumphing over<BR>
content here."<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<P>(((Yeah, and worse yet, that green lower case "bp" is in a
lame san-serif font.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Earlier  in July, BP announced its capital investment
plans for the next three years,  which included a doubling
of its planned investment in renewables, to $500m.  A  lot
of money, you might say, but consider that the total
investment budget is  $40.5bn, of which $24bn is for oil
and gas exploration and production. This  investment will
mean a rise in oil production of 4-5% per year, and gas
production by 8% per year. Not exactly the actions of a
company wholly intent  on going 'beyond petroleum.'"</P>

<P>(((I'm with the facts and figures here, but let me break
some personal financial news.  Though I'm doubling my
planned investment in Viridian agitation, I make all my
real money as a novelist.  That means my industrial
interests are firmly aligned with Bantam Books,
Amazon.com, Barnes and Noble, et alia.  These enterprises
pick up 92% of the revenue that my creative endeavors
produce, while I tend to get about 8 percent, of which
only a teensy, derisory fraction goes into  activism.  Do
you see any <STRONG>publishers</STRONG> and <STRONG>bookstores</STRONG> attaching solar
plates to themselves?  And think of all the trees we're
jointly killing.  Financial analysis proves me to be
grossly duplicitous, but do you imagine I'll stop selling
those books?  In a pig's eye, brother!)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"While BP is the market leader in solar
photovoltaics, it has no other renewables to speak of in
its portfolio,  and no  obvious game plan as to how to get
between here and a non-fossil future."   (((Well, BP does
own quite a large chunk of greenmountain.com, the Austin,
Texas-based clean energy retail company.  Greenmountain's
got so many game plans that they tried to purchase the</P>

<P>next President.)))  "At  least Shell is talking about<BR>
perhaps half its business being renewable by 2050 ==<BR>
vague, but an articulated aspiration nonetheless."<BR>
<BR>
(((Yes, yes, but Shell's logo is so... inadequate.)))<BR>
<BR>
"I will also be slightly cynical about the solar<BR>
petrol stations == while there  may be certain altruistic<BR>
and public image gains from the programme, the fact<BR>
remains that the cost of installing the PV arrays is<BR>
outweighed by the extra  business that is generated at the<BR>
stations in question. I'm sure this never,  ever crossed<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<P>the minds of the executives that dreamed up the scheme."
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(((I have some cynical solar on my house, too.  We
waste energy galore whenever we throw a house party and
everyone has to admire the big panels up there. It would
certainly never occur to me that this might cause somebody
to buy one of my books, though.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;" If you  want a report about PV gas stations, I was</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>at the opening of BP's first, at Perivale in West London<BR>
in Spring last year.  There's not much to see == the<BR>
panels are all on the roof. However, look out for the new<BR>
'BP Connect' stations  that will be opening in Cleveland<BR>
and Indianapolis later this year. They  feature thin-film<BR>
PV incorporated into a transparent canopy. Very hi-tech<BR></P>

<P>whizz-bang."</P>

<P>(((And in <STRONG>Cleveland!</STRONG>  Whoa!)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"I will attempt to use my contacts in BP to obtain
you a 'sunflower' t-shirt."</P>

<P>(((That's very kind of you indeed.  I have every intention
of wearing it.  Rule Cool Britannia!)))</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In a country baked by uncounted gigawatts of solar
energy every day, Australians are used to seeing solar
energy in day to day life.  Emergency call points on
highways, solar hot water systems, and solar powered
construction signs and billboards are common here on the
West Coast of the continent.  So when we gas-guzzling,
car-addicted antipodeans pull into the BP petrol station
with a huge array of solar cells perched on the roof, it</P>

to be conversely seen as insane, embarrassing and
abnormal.)))
