<P>Well, I'm unable to conclusively locate a Resistance Party

The antifa site belongs to a Dutch "antifascist" group.

<P>Ooh.  I wonder if I can win a gold star.  :)</P>

<P>Anyways, as far as I can tell, the name of the party in
Dutch is Verzets-Partij, which translates into the
Resistance Party.  Their home page is http://www.verzets-

<P>There's a picture of Ruben Hubbers along with some more

about 25 members.  The are putting forward a program of

<P>There's even more Viridian irony in this situation than
you suggest in Note 00191. The UK's high duty and tax on
fuel was intended as a disincentive to road use, for
environmental reasons. The last (Conservative) government
instituted a escalator on fuel duty that kept increases at
5% above inflation, but the current government abolished
the escalator in the last budget.
<BR></P>

<P>Many of the road haulage industry's woes are due to
over-competitiveness in the industry, rather than fuel
taxation, and they're some of the more notorious carbon
emitters as well.
<BR></P>

<P>The protesters are claiming that they have popular
support. An opinion poll reported on Tuesday 12th showed
that 78% of motorists were in favour of the protests. Far
from being an honest expression of solidarity, this poll
is more likely to be result of the traditional British
attitude of 'I'm alright Jack' self-interest == cheap fuel
is cheap fuel, after all.</P>

<P>John Oomkes (reporter)
<BR></P>

<P>"Under the possibly misleading name Resistance Party,
two Bloemendalers have this week founded a new extreme-
right party. President is 19-year-old Ruben Hubbers, who
in 1997 was underage candidate for Center Democrat (CD, a
merely far-right party) in the Haarlem [city] council
election. He is dissatisfied with the present political
business and wants to be a driving force. The VP wants to
participate in the 2002 elections for the Second Chamber
[like House of Commons or House of Representatives]. The
VP claims a membership of 25."
<BR></P>

<P>To make a long story short, the Haarlem public
prosecutor's office is looking to bust the Resistance
Party for their misleading name and incitement to hate-
crimes.  The Resistance Party loathe crime, drugs
(marijuana and hash addiction!), and mooching immigrants.
They think the present Dutch government is corrupt and
neds to get back to basics and family values.
<BR></P>

<P>Hubbers goes on to distance himself from the CD, his
one-time employer. The CD are too far-right for Hubbers'
taste. Hubbers considers himself in the mainstream right.
He applauds the work of the WWII Resistance of 1940-45 and
hopes to carry on their good work now.

<BR>

<P>One of the less hysterical points made by truckers has
been "All  we want is parity with rest of the EC on road
taxes and fuel duty".
<BR></P>

<P>The assumption could be that the rest of the EC is
'enjoying' lower  prices than its blockade-stricken
neighbour states.  The fear is that 'foreign' competition
will get a tank full of gas on the  Continent, then pop
across the Channel to the UK and spend a week  trucking
round the country, undercutting the natives' rates and
paying no duty or road tax, before going back to  the
Continent to fill up again.
<BR></P>

<P>So there is a sub-text here of concern about UK's
further integration into Europe. The 'received wisdom' is
that Tony Blair is nudging  public opinion as firmly as he
can to the point where his government  takes Britain
closer to union. The  specific concern is that, for some
people, unless there is  harmonisation of fuel duty &amp; road
taxes, this will be all losses and  no gains.
<BR></P>

<P>We see a worrying international feedback loop
embedded in this dynamic. Any government  that does the
responsible thing and raises taxes on fossil fuels  faster
than its neighbours will be prey to damaging protests,
until it relents and retreats to the same tax rates as the
least responsible  neighbour.</P>

<P>You also wrote:</P>

<EM> &gt;(((These truckers must have email.  There's a Seattle-WTO<BR>
&gt;style wasp-swarm thing going on here: the disparate<BR>

&gt;of authorization from conventional labor authorities, the<BR>
&gt;wide variety of chosen targets, the suddenness of it ==<BR>
&gt;it's all too effective not to be digital.)))<BR> </EM>
<BR>

<P>Speaking as a UK citizen, what has frustrated me over
the last couple  of days is the lack of any digitally
organised counter-movement to express the feeling that
some of us (a minority, apparently, but a  significant
minority) back the Government.  It's a first for me with
any popular protest == I would be happy to see <STRONG>higher</STRONG>
fuel duty.
<BR></P>

<P>I keep checking Friends of the Earth's web site, but
there's just a  few lame press releases about how they're
backing Tony Blair to stand  firm.
<A HREF="http://www.foe.co.uk/pubsinfo/infoteam/pressrel/">http://www.foe.co.uk/pubsinfo/infoteam/pressrel/</A>
<BR></P>

<P>Apart from FoE's director making points about high fuel
prices being  good for the economy (by encouraging
efficiency) on a 'highbrow' news  programme on BBC's
minority interest channel, there has been no  coverage
that I've seen of the reasons for standing firm.
<BR></P>

<P>Meanwhile Greenpeace UK's website is a design
abomination. It told me  to upgrade my IE5 browser to
Netscape 4.7 and download 6 plugins that  I already have
before I could properly enjoy the site.  Just  before it
crashed my iMac, I saw enough to conclude that the design
straitjacket did not allow for daily updates about current
issues.
<BR></P>

<P>UK greens still have much to do to find a voice in
the media!
<BR></P>

<P>Speaking from Sheffield, England's fifth largest
city, my own hope is  that people will start to realise
how nice their towns and cities could be with less of our
eternal gridlock.</P>

<P>The first batch of activity began last month, but

and the problem's grown from there. The fuel crisis is the
main topic of conversation, on phone and off.  You can
have a distressing kind of fun listening to people spread
panic: bread-rationing at one supermarket in Derby rapidly
became rumors of bread-rationing everywhere in Britain.
<BR></P>

talking about the fuel crisis and five minutes on the rest
of Earth's activity. I've not seen that solid coverage of
a single issue since the Gulf War.</P>

<P>"GREEDY     Fuel Protest Update!</P>

<P>"Breaking News: The Government are to take decisive action
Thursday at 7am according to reports from a government
source.</P>

<P>"Updates shortly...</P>

<P>"Tony Blair's has now arrogantly stated that "he cannot
and he will not" change government policy due to pressure
from the fuel protests. His comments are only having one
effect == he is confirming public opinion that he thinks
he is infallible == just as in the Millennium Dome, eh
Tony?!</P>

<P>"What Tony Blair and other politicians, on all sides, are
actually saying to us is that we only have a say at
election time. Therefore we are only a democracy at the
lead up to elections. He sees the rest of his term as his
own personal dictatorship and what he says goes.</P>

<P>"Accountants Chantrey Vellacott revealed the Treasury gets
L330million extra a year for every one-dollar rise in the
world oil price == mainly because of increased VAT and
revenue from North Sea producers.</P>

<P>"Oil has risen from $22 to $34 a barrel since the March
Budget == equal to a L4BILLION boost to the public purse.
Chantrey's economics chief Maurice Fitzpatrick said this
was enough to allow a fuel tax cut of 8p a litre, or 36p a
gallon. AEEU engineering union boss Sir Ken Jackson said
Mr Brown should cut duty by at least 2p to ease
'ridiculous prices.'</P>

<P>"If Tony Blair will not listen to public protests, what
will he listen to? For years his government have ignored
the arguments of
The Petrol Retailers Association
The RAC
The AA
Countless other protesters (like fuelprotest.com and
boycott-the-pumps)</P>
