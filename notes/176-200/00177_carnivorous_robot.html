Stuart Wilkinson is a hard-working academic and,
although he clearly sees the humor in this effort,
he's not kidding.

<P>"Could the future of robotics be a toy train with a taste
for flesh?"</P>

<P>by Duncan Graham-Rowe</P>

<P>"Beware: a hungry, flesh-eating robot called Chew Chew
could have designs on you. Not that you won't hear the
beast coming: Chew Chew is a 12-wheeled monster that looks</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>more like a train. But he's also the first robot to be<BR>
completely powered by food. He's called a gastrobot == and<BR>
he is set to make his public debut in August, at a<BR>
robotics conference in Hawaii.<BR></P>

  <P>"Chew Chew's 'stomach' is a microbial fuel cell (MFC),</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>a device that enslaves a population of bacteria, in this
case E. coli, to break down food and convert chemical
energy into electricity. The ideal fuel, in terms of
energy gain, is meat, says inventor Stuart Wilkinson of
the University of South Florida in Tampa. 'Vegetation is
not nearly as nutritious,' he explains. But eating meat
requires you to catch it first and that, in turn, requires
a lot of extra energy and complex behaviours, he says.

<P>"Early applications for gastrobots are likely to<BR>
include mowing lawns ==  and grazing on grass clippings<BR>
for fuel. The long-term idea is to develop autonomous<BR>
robots that can feed themselves, says Wilkinson.<BR></P>

  <P>"The robot consists of three wheeled wagons, each</P>

<P>about a metre long. For convenience, says Wilkinson, Chew
Chew only eats sugar cubes at the moment because these are
almost entirely broken down by the microbes, producing
virtually no waste." (...)</P>
