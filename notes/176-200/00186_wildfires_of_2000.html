(((Since my PlaNetwork speech about the symbolic meaning
of the burning of Los Alamos, the fire situation in the
American West has been getting steadily worse.</P>

<P>(((Lest one conclude, as certain spin doctors have, that
this is a failure of American federal forest management, I
might also point out that Europe is also extensively on
fire this summer.</P>

<P>(((How long will it be before the American military is
permanently deployed to fight climate disasters here and
abroad?  The military are, after all, the traditional last
resort for  politics-by-other-means.)))</P>

<P>"More Military Troops Head West to Fight Fires</P>

<P>"Posted on Mon, 28 Aug 2000 20:47:31 GMT</P>

<P>"Written by Christina Ward, Staff Writer,
DisasterRelief.org, with news reports
<BR></P>

<P>"A weekend of strong winds fueled dozens of raging
wildfires  across the West, forcing fire crews to focus on
protection of homes and people, rather than on containment
of the blazes."</P>

<P>(((Viridian rewrite:  "The American landscape is burning
out of control and the Army is fitfully attempting to</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>shelter the interests of insurance companies.")))<BR>
<BR>
"President Clinton ordered 500 more troops from the<BR>
U.S. Army to join the fire lines this week == part of a<BR>
federal goal to have 2,500 military personnel, or five<BR>
full battalions, assisting firefighting efforts by Labor<BR>
Day."<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<P>(((The US Army may be grateful for a working role here.
They saw no action at all during the war in Serbia.)))
<BR></P>

<P>"The fifth battalion is due to arrive from Fort
Bragg, N.C., today (Aug. 28), and will be assigned to the
Troy South fire in Montana's Kootenai National Forest.
<BR></P>

<P>"There are 84 large fires burning in Arizona,
California, Florida, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico,
North Dakota, Oregon, South Dakota, Texas, Utah,
Washington and  Wyoming, according to the National
Interagency Fire Center (NIFC)."  (((If you live in one of
those states, go out and have a good look at your sky.
Remember when it used to be blue?)))
<BR></P>

<P>"This year's fire season in the United States is 
the
worst in 50 years."  (((And counting, since it's by no
means over yet.)))
<BR></P>

<P>(...) "There are about 22,000 people fighting fires
in the West."  (((And they're losing so badly they had to
call the Army in.)))   "The cost of fighting the Montana
fires so far is estimated at $87.4 million."  (((Put it on
the coal company's tab.)))</P>

<P>(((Now here's the good part.  Check out this unintentional
poetic litany of web links.)))</P>
