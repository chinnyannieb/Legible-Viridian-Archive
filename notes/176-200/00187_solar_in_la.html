MILLION IN SOLAR DURING FIRST YEAR OF EFFORT</P>

<P>"Contract to AstroPower, Inc. for Phase One of Ambitious
Program Announced
<BR></P>

<P>(...) "This contract is the largest single award for
solar power since utility deregulation was introduced in
the U.S. seven years ago.  The contract represents only
the first phase of an ambitious four-year, $38 million
program to provide clean solar power to LADWP customers.
<BR></P>

<P>"'This marks a new chapter in our quest to make solar
power widely available in the City of Los Angeles,' said
Angelina Galiteva, LADWP director of strategic planning.
'We hope that other energy companies throughout America
will take our lead and give the people what they want:
electricity that is clean, safe and reliable.'</P>

<P>(...) "Many of the solar panels AstroPower will provide
under this contract will be installed on the Los Angeles
Convention Center. When completed this fall, this facility
will be the largest solar-powered building to date in
North America."  (((These solar panels were loudly
showcased during the Democratic National Convention, but
the Party's out of town now, while the lust for power is
chronic.)))
<BR></P>

<P>(...) "The solar program is one in a series of
environmental initiatives that include the Green Power for
a Green LA, Energy Solutions for a Green LA, Cool Schools
Tree Planting Program and Electric Transportation for a
Green LA. Information about these programs is available at

<P>"AstroPower Powers Up Large California Convention Centers</P>

<P>"Solar Power Systems to Provide Valuable Peak Electricity
Amidst California Power Crunch
<BR></P>

<P>"NEWARK, Del., Aug. 29 /PRNewswire/ == The Los Angeles
Convention Center is now generating its own electricity
with solar panels supplied by AstroPower, Inc. (Nasdaq:
APWR).  The Anaheim Convention Center will soon be doing
the same, with the installation of a similar system this
fall. (...)
<BR></P>

<P>"'Rising power bills and threats of blackouts in
California have been front page news all summer,' said
AstroPower President Dr. Allen M. Barnett.
<BR></P>

<P>"'Clearly, more power generation is needed, and solar
power is an ideal solution.  Solar electric power is
clean, renewable, non-polluting, and it provides
electricity during hot summer days when utility power is
in shortest supply.'
<BR></P>

<P>"The first phase of the LA Convention Center
project, a 120 kW system, was installed in time to provide
power for the Democratic National Convention. The system
has over 2,000 solar panels, and is designed to blend in
with the Convention Center architecture.  Panels are
mounted on a highly visible curving wall overlooking the
busy Harbor Freeway in downtown Los Angeles." (((The Los
Angeles Convention Center is a busy mass of mirrorshades
that <STRONG>all</STRONG> look just like solar panels.)))
<BR></P>

<P>"The Anaheim Convention Center project will use over
900 AstroPower panels, and will be rated at 100 kW.  These
larger panels are being integrated into PowerGuard roofing
tiles manufactured by PowerLight Corporation of Berkeley,
CA.  These roofing tiles generate on-site electricity, and
add roof insulation.  They also lower building cooling and
heating needs and extend the roof's life."  (((And they
cost a fortune, too, but we're working on that.)))
<BR></P>

<P>"'Our solar electric power systems are also available
for homes and businesses,' said AstroPower Director of
North American Business Howard J. Wenger.  'They're simply
mini versions of the large Convention Center projects.
We're starting to see some growth in sales to consumers
who want to make their own clean electricity, reduce the
impact of utility rate hikes, and have back-up power in
the event of blackouts."</P>

<P>"Electricity Outages Getting Some Users  All Steamed Up
<BR></P>

<P>By NANCY RIVERA BROOKS, Los Angeles Times Staff Writer
<BR></P>

<P>"California's power emergency has been a rude awakening
for about 1,200 manufacturers, hotels, schools, retailers,
hospitals and other outfits that have endured major
outages over the last several weeks.
<BR></P>

<P>"The fallout ranged from minor aggravations to major
financial losses: There were science experiments that went
bad. Satellite components that didn't get built. Amusement
park rides that slipped into eerie darkness." (((Oh yeah.
I am so with that last Californian detail.)))
<BR></P>

<P>"These big electricity users have been getting
cheaper electric rates for years as a reward for putting
themselves in exactly this position: agreeing to slash
power consumption when the state's supplies run
dangerously short.   This summer, for the first time,
they're repeatedly being called upon to live up to their
agreements. In doing so, they are among the last sentinels
on the edge of an unknown territory created by
California's electricity crisis." (((Any Californian
anxious to explore the "unknown territory" of spotty
electrical supplies should hop in the old Greenhouse
sport-ute and visit Mexico.  After all, you guys used to
<STRONG>be</STRONG> Mexico, and with a little more heat and less
infrastructure, the good old days are back.)))
<BR></P>

<P>"Without these customers' energy crash diets,
neighborhoods around the state  could be plunged into the
first deliberate blackouts since World War II."  (((Can
the boys in khaki-green be far behind?  Better wait till
they're through fighting those Montana wildfires.)))
<BR></P>

<P>"But many of them are getting tired of this summer's
severe disruptions, which are collectively costing them
millions of dollars in lost productivity if they interrupt
power == and millions of dollars in fines if they don't."
(((Put it on the coal company's tab.)))
<BR></P>

<P>"If all of the state's 'interruptible' customers
comply with the call to reduce usage on a hot day when
supplies are short, they theoretically could decrease
power demand by nearly 3,000 megawatts, equal to the
production of six mid-size power plants. Actual relief has
never exceeded about 1,900 megawatts, but that can make a
critical difference when demand is peaking above 42,000
megawatts and the power grid is using more than 95% of
available electricity."
<BR></P>

<P>(((You may have missed it, but they said "42,000
megawatts!"  While the LA Convention Center, America's
biggest solar building, boasts 1.5 megawatts in a full
California sun.  But we Viridians don't see that glass as
half-empty == why, there's a mere 41,999.5 megawatts to
go!
<BR></P>

<P>(((Meanwhile, life goes on in Southern California's
new "voluntary brownout" regime.  This could be your town
some fine summer day, if it isn't already:)))
<BR></P>

<P>"Knott's Berry Farm first kills lights and air
conditioners in its backstage and administrative areas,
but several times has needed to close some popular rides,
such as Big Foot Rapids, for a few hours.
<BR></P>

<P>"Children's Hospital of Orange County switches to a
backup generator so  patient care is not affected.
<BR></P>

<P>"Hyatt Regency Long Beach shifts laundry operations
to the evening, cuts power to parts of the hotel that
aren't being used and switches off lights in the lobby,
relying instead on sunlight streaming in through walls of
plate glass.
<BR></P>

<P>"Because the program is voluntary, not every
customer curbs power use when asked, although the price of
noncompliance is a heavy fine (...)  There is evidence
that compliance is slipping, particularly in the 50,000-
square-mile territory  served by Southern California
Edison.  (...)
<BR></P>

<P>"Already this year, Cal-ISO has called for power
interruptions 12 times for a total of about 13,450
megawatt hours.  Last year Cal-ISO called for a single
power interruption of about 1,155 megawatt hours." (((A
ratio of 12 to 1 is quite a trend line in one year:
imagine the fun in 2005.)))
<BR></P>

<P>"While these interruptible users say they are proud
of the finger-in-the-dike  role they play in assisting the
electricity grid, many are complaining.  (...) Some
Southern Californians to grouse that they are bailing out
their neighbors to the north, including electron-guzzling
Silicon Valley."</P>
