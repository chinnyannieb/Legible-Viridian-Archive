<P>"Glacial thaw reveals wartime 'city of ice'
By Bruce Johnston in Rome
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"THE partial thawing of a glacier in north-eastern
Italy as the result of a heatwave has revealed a 'city of
ice' which Austro-Hungarian troops built inside it during
the First World War.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Signs of an often talked about but never before seen
nest of bunkers, barracks, cells, corridors and storage
areas have come to light on one side of the Marmolada
glacier in the Dolomites. Close by, fortifications built
by the Italians to fight the Austro-Hungarians have also
begun to appear.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Reports said the appearance of the city of ice and
other wartime remains was the result of sustained
temperatures of 50F (10C) at about 10,000ft above sea
level, and probably also global warming.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"On Monday the skeleton of a First World War soldier
was found 8,850ft up on the Adamello glacier, near
Vedretta di Lares, in Trentino. Last September another
soldier's skeleton, complete with his cap and equipment,
turned up on the nearby Presanella glacier."</P>


<P>(((Now for the good part:  a melting glacier disgorges a
Viridian Involuntary Park in a military Wexelblat
Disaster.)))
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In Adamello, 20,000 First World War bombs, 13,000 of
them containing poison gas, have come to light. So far
6,300 have been dealt with.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"A similar retreat of glaciers on Mont Blanc has
recently uncovered pieces of Italian artillery dating from
the Second World War and parts of an Air India Boeing 707
which crashed there in 1966.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Thawing in the Similaun glacier, north-west of
Bolzano, led to the discovery in 1991 of a hunter who had
lived 5,300 years ago."</P>

<P>(((That last glacier disgorgee would be the famous"Otzi",
a dude with a rockin' sense of preindustrial design.)))
