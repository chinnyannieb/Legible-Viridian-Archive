<P><strong>European Commission Proposes an Integrated Energy and
Climate Change Package to Cut Emissions for the 21st
Century</strong></P>

<P>WASHINGTON &ndash; (BUSINESS WIRE) &ndash; The European
Commission today proposed a comprehensive new Energy
Policy for Europe to combat climate change and boost
the European Union's energy security and
competitiveness.  <span class="bluetext">(((Okay Wikipedia, what the heck
is the "European Commission"?)))</span></P>

<P>Link:<BR>
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Commission</A><BR>
"The European Commission (formally the Commission of
the European Communities) is the executive body of
the European Union. Alongside the European Parliament
and the Council of the European Union, it is one of
the three main institutions governing the Union."</P>

<P>Setting a series of ambitious targets on greenhouse
gas emissions and renewable energy, the package of
proposals aims to create a true internal market for
energy and strengthen effective regulation. The
Commission believes that when an international
agreement is reached on the post-2012 framework
this should lead to a 30% cut in emissions from
developed countries by 2020.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((That's a lot.  Nowhere near enough, but a lot.)))</span></P>

<P>To further underline its commitment the Commission
proposes that the European Union commits now to cut
greenhouse gas emissions by at least 20% by 2020,
in particular through energy measures.</P>

<P>"Today marks a step change for the European Union.
Energy policy was a core area at the start of the
European project," said Commission President Jos&acirc;ˆš&Acirc;&copy;
Manuel Barroso.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((That's because the European Union was invented
in 1951 in order to dig up coal!  True fact!)))</span></P>


<P>Link:<BR>
<A HREF="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Coal_and_Steel_Community">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_Coal_and_Steel_Community</A></p>

<P>"We must now return it to center stage. The challenges
of climate change, increasing import dependence and
higher energy prices are faced by all EU members.
A common European response is necessary to deliver
sustainable, secure and competitive energy.
The proposals put forward by the Commission today
demonstrate our commitment to leadership and a
long-term vision for a new Energy Policy for Europe
that responds to climate change. We must act now,
to shape tomorrow's world."</P>

<P>"If we take the right decisions now," Commissioner for
Energy Policy, Andris Piebalgs said,  <span class="bluetext">(((what names
they have)))</span> "Europe can lead the world to a new
industrial revolution: the development of a low carbon
economy." <span class="bluetext">(((Well, it wouldn't be their first
industrial revolution, that's for sure.)))</span></P>

<P>"Our ambition to create a working internal
market, to promote a clean and efficient energy mix
and to make the right choices in research and
development will determine whether we lead this
new scenario or we follow others."</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Actually, if you're European, you don't follow
anybody on the climate issue, but you do get
ruthlessly shaken down by petrocrat Russians.
Which really, really won't do.  This is basically
a unilateral, internal European Kyoto.  They
don't care what the rest of the world says any
more: they're gonna do it themselves and build
a big legal-economic Schengen moat around it.
If you don't want to play, you can go sit on
your own bayonets.)))</span></P>

<P>Stavros Dimas, Commissioner for the Environment said:
"Climate change is one of the gravest threats to our
planet. Acting against climate change is imperative.
Today, we have agreed on a set of ambitious, but
realistic targets which will support our global
efforts to contain climate change and its most dire
consequences."</P>

<span class="bluetext">(((What kind of  climate consequences? EUROPEAN
climate consequences, the kind we European
Commissioners really care about!)))</span><br>

<P>"I urge the rest of the developed world to follow
our lead, match our reductions and accelerate
progress towards an international agreement on
the global emission reductions."  <span class="bluetext">(((Hey, what
about the anti-developed state-failure world?
They don't even have governments, but they're
still selling tons of oil.  In fact, the more
oil they sell, the faster they un-develop.)))</span></P>

<P>"Europe faces real challenges. There is a more than a
50% chance that global temperatures will rise during
this century by more than 5 degrees Celsius."</P>

<P>Link:<BR>
<span class="bluetext">(((Aw c'mon!  How could that possibly be a problem?
Forbes Magazine loves it!  Forbes' pet denialists
don't deny the truth any more &ndash; their new tactic
for 2007 is not to care! Business in a world without
snow will be great!  Stop fretting!)))</span><br>

<P>"On current projections, energy and transport policies
would mean that rather than falling, EU emissions
would increase by around 5% by 2030. With current
trends and policies, the EU's energy import dependence
will jump from 50% of total EU energy consumption
today to 65% in 2030. In addition, the internal
energy market remains incomplete which prevents
EU citizens and the EU economy from receiving the
full benefits of energy liberalization.  <span class="bluetext">(((Russian
gas for everybody, even the Irish!)))</span></P>

<P>The package proposed by the Commission today seeks
to provide solutions to these challenges.
