<P>March to Redeem the Soul of America<BR>
Valley Reed, Chief Organizer, <A HREF="mailto:valley.reed@earthlink.net">valley.reed@earthlink.net</A></P>

<P>ExxonMobil War Boycott<BR>
Nick Mottern, National Director, <A HREF="mailto:nickmottern@earthlink.net">nickmottern@earthlink.net</A></P>

<P>"The March to Redeem the Soul of America was launched
with press conferences and  marches in Irving, Texas
on April 1 <span class="bluetext">(((they may have to work on those date
choices)))</span>  and Dallas on April 2, beginning a<BR>
120-mile walk that  will arrive in Crawford, Texas
on Thursday, April 13. The March will participate
in 'Easter  in Crawford' &ndash; with President Bush<BR>
planning to take his usual Easter vacation at his
ranch &ndash; and the celebration of the third anniversary
of the Crawford Peace House.</P>

<P>"The unifying themes of speakers on the first two
days was the need for citizens to begin to get control
of the combine of government and major corporations &ndash;
not only to stop the  Iraq war, but to protect human
rights and civil liberties. The March organizers and
participants are asking communities to join their
calls for an end to war profiteering and  an end to
the occupation of Iraq.</P>

<P>"In Irving, people gathered outside ExxonMobil's world
headquarters and called on the oil  giant to work to
end the Iraq war and to spend $7 billion in undeserved
2005 war profits  to meet human needs related to the
Iraq war and ExxonMobil operations. Speaking were
Nick Mottern, Director, ConsumersforPeace.org and the
ExxonMobil War Boycott  campaign; Rev. Roy Malveaux,
Beaumont, Texas; State Rep. Lon Burnam, Fort Worth;
Maureen Haver, Jumpstart Ford Campaign; Hadi Jawad,
Crawford Peace House and Dallas  Peace Center; Rev.
Peter Johnson, Dallas civil rights leader; Margarita
Alvarez, United  Voices for Immigrants; Judith Kaufman;
and Valley Reed, chief organizer, March to Redeem
Campaign.</P>

<P>"The AP covered the press conference; its report was
published by many  newspapers.</P>

<P>"Rev. Roy Malveaux from Beaumont Texas explained how
ExxonMobil has rejected any  responsibility for severe
health problems in his community, located next to an
ExxonMobil  Refinery.</P>

<P>"Sunny Miller, Traprock Peace Center, lead the song
'Step by Step' as the press conference  ended and the
March began with people marching past ExxonMobil's
main gate.</P>

<P>"On April 2nd in Dallas, the march held a press<BR>
conference outside the County Courthouse  and Jail.
Joan Cobici; American Civil Liberties Union and<BR>
Beatriz Saldivar, Gold Star Families  for Peace (her
nephew was killed in Iraq) joined Reed, Mottern,<BR>
Johnson and Jawad as  speakers.</P>

<P>"Beatrice Saldivar held a picture of her nephew killed
in Iraq and a picture of Rex Tillerson,  Chair and
C.E.O. of Exxon Mobil, saying, 'Do you think Mr. Rex
Tillerson, the Chief and  CEO of ExxonMobil will ever
go to Iraq? Do you think he will ever put himself in a
jail like  this where they are putting our Hispanics
and our African Americans?'"</P>


<P>"Speakers at the Dallas Jail said money is needed for
programs and jobs for young people  to keep them out of
jail. Money and management changes are also needed to
deal with  serious health problems, such as HIV and
hepatitis, that are spread into the community  when
prisoners go home, according to Rev. Peter Johnson,
Dallas civil rights activist. $3.3  billion in federal
tax dollars has gone to the Iraq war from Dallas County
alone, according  to the National Priorities Project.
Texas has spent $25.6 billion on the war.</P>

<P>"Marchers then crossed the Trinity River and met again
outside the VA Hospital. Marchers  received an<BR>
enthusiastic reception, with banners, drumming<BR>
(provided by Drums not Guns)  and food (courtesy of
Food Not Bombs). Rev. Diane Baker, Dallas Peace Center;
John  Fullenwider, High School teacher (speaking on the
cost of war); Michael McNeil, veteran of  Desert Storm
(Marine Corps) and member of Code Pink; Jim Goodnow,
Veterans for Peace;  and John Wolf, founder of<BR>
Crawford Peace House added their voices.</P>

<P>"Speakers addressed the need for quality medical and
psychological services for veterans,  and the under
reporting of war casualties.</P>

<P>"Nick Mottern, Director of Consumers for Peace, said
the War Boycott is calling on  ExxonMobil to give $630
million directly to the Veterans Administration to
supply money  for mental health care, prosthetics and
catastrophic care. This is the amount in a<BR>
supplemental appropriations bill that was blocked by
House Republicans several weeks  ago.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((It's not too surprising that these proletarian
lefties and inveterate peaceniks should attack Exxon,
for (by my modest count there) war profiteering,
racism, overcrowded jails, civil liberties, human
rights, HIV, hepatitis, mental illness, combat
fatalities, the Pentagon's budget, the need for
prosthetics, pollution, environmental illnesses,
foreign adventurism and buying Congress wholesale.
But wait till it starts dawning on conservatives
and rich people that climate-change is Exxon's biggest
product, and that climate disruption  is causing
horrific economic damage  to their own pocketbooks.
Somebody somewhere is gonna go down hard for that.
There really isn't a better candidate for
scapegoating and deliberate public punishment than
the people of Exxon.  And they're sure not gonna
lack for fingerpointing.  They're all over the world,
and all over the world people hate them.)))</span></P>
