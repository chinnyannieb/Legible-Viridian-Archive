Now look back to the mayhem in 2003 when Canberra
was on fire.  It's the Katrina story avant
la lettre. "The firestorms that hit Canberra on
Saturday, laying waste to suburban streets and
overwhelming  firefighters, were the capital's worst.
'This is certainly the most devastating bushfire
experience  that any community in Australia has ever
suffered,'  said John Stanhope, Chief Minister of
the Australian Capital Territory.  Mr Stanhope
defended emergency services against criticism that
they were unprepared for the scale of the disaster,
with hundreds of householders left to fight the
flames alone with buckets and garden hoses.
'It was a one-in-100 or  200 years' experience,
an event of such enormity, of such force and
such devastating power that it  simply ran over
the top of us,' he said.  <span class="bluetext">(((It's easy to predict
the future when all you have to do is predict
the past.  Every time people in power who
deny the Greenhouse get their ass kicked, they
always proclaim that nobody could have imagine
such a thing.  We don't have to "imagine" it,
guys.  All one has to do is document it.)))</span><br><br>
Here in 2005, after seven Viridian years,
I'm writing this Note in the hall of the ERA 05 ICSID
World Design Conference in Copenhagen.  This has
got to be a textbook case of a design dilettante
getting too close to his material.<br>

<h2>GOVERNMENT RESPONSE</h2>
<em>"Bush looks to Pentagon to take lead in disasters
If Congress likes idea, local officials would lose
some of their powers</em><br><br>
By JULIE MASON<BR>
Copyright 2005 Houston Chronicle<br><br>
"BATON ROUGE &ndash; President Bush indicated Sunday that
he may ask Congress to put the Pentagon in charge of
the response to domestic disasters such as the two
recent hurricanes &ndash; a change that could take
authority from the hands of governors and local
officials.  <span class="bluetext">(((That's not the lede; the lede
is that climate change has overwhelmed the
pretense of  civilian capacity. It's not about
Bush power versus government power.  We don't
yet have a society capable of responding to
genuine Greenhouse enormities.)))</span>
"Bush discussed the idea in general terms as
prominent members of Congress said on public affairs
TV shows that the responses to Katrina and Rita
will be investigated and that a new approach may
be needed to coordinate rescue and recovery efforts.
"At a briefing at Randolph Air Force Base in San
Antonio, military leaders who are members of
Joint Task Force-Rita told the president that
a national plan for disaster response would avert
the 'train wreck' of future Hurricane Katrinas.
<span class="bluetext">(((The organizational problem at hand would
be much better understood as a train of Katrinas.
It's not that a big storm comes and you pass the
blame buck.  It's that big storms come all the
time.)))</span><br><br>
"Army Maj. Gen. John White told Bush that chaos,
combined with good intentions, led to problems
in responding to Katrina that could be averted
with better oversight.<br><br>
'"That was a train wreck we saw in New Orleans,'
White said. 'But if we can have a national plan
that would address the search and rescue at this
magnitude, (that) is what we're out to try to do.'"
<span class="bluetext">(((It's good to see that Bush's military subordinates
fully share his rhetorical clarity.)))</span><br><br>
<strong>"Assessing the response</strong><br><br>
"A tired-looking Bush, who traveled to U.S. Northern
Command in Colorado and to Austin, San Antonio and
Baton Rouge this weekend to assess storm response,
said it was exactly the message he wanted to take
back to Washington.  <span class="bluetext">(((Anybody want to place a bet
on how many storms this guy has to spin during the
rest of his tenure?)))</span><br><br>
"'Part of the reason I've come down here, and part
of the reason I went to Northcom, was to better
understand how the federal government can plan
and surge equipment to mitigate natural disasters,'
Bush said.  <span class="bluetext">(((I'm liking this "surge" thing;
your city's underwater and eaten by mold, but,
well, here comes a federal "surge."  Maybe the
key to future life is to forget about living
in cities and find a way to inhabit "surges.")))</span>
"In the case of a terrorist attack, the Defense
Department would automatically serve as the lead
authority in overseeing a response, Bush said.
But he added that the Pentagon also could take
a top role in a large-scale natural disaster.
<span class="bluetext">(((Why not just cut to the chase and reclassify
Exxon-Mobil as 'climate terrorists'?)))</span>
"'Is there a natural disaster which &ndash; of a certain
size, that would then enable the Defense Department
to become the lead agency in coordinating and leading
the response effort?" Bush asked rhetorically.
"That's going to be a very important consideration
for Congress to think about."<br><br>
"Such a move would have significant implications
for local authorities in storm-prone states such
as Texas, Florida and Louisiana.  <span class="bluetext">(((Not to mention
earthquake-prone states, volcano-prone states,
forest-fire-prone states, drought-prone states,
flood-prone states, Arctic-thaw prone states, and
climate-tipping-re-routing-of-the Sargasso Current
prone states, mostly in Europe.)))</span>
"Decreasing states' rights  <span class="bluetext">(((Protect your
'right' to be rescued from drowning by your own
mayor)))</span><br><br>
"Currently, state governors are responsible for
disaster preparedness and response, including
calling in their National Guard units.
"Governors can request assistance from the Federal
Emergency Management Agency. If federal armed
forces are brought in to help, they do so in
support of FEMA and their activities are restricted
by law.  <span class="bluetext">(((I wonder if King Canute had a FEMA.
"See that monster tidal surge?  That thing's
restricted by law.")))</span><br><br>
"Putting the planning and oversight in the Pentagon's
hands would effectively federalize disaster response,
possibly eroding states' legal rights, which Bush and
many other conservatives have worked to strengthen.
<span class="bluetext">((("Baghdad on the Mississippi."  I wonder if they'll
get New Orleans on its feet before Miami or Houston
gets clobbered.)))</span><br><br>
"Still, White said better coordination at the federal
level would head off situations such as the arrival
of five helicopters at one place to rescue the same
person in New Orleans.  <span class="bluetext">(((Five choppers for one
damsel in distress?   That ought to be par
for the course for Paris Hilton.)))</span>
"'That's the sort of simplistic thing we'd like
to avoid, and we're not maximizing the use of
our forces to best efficiency,' White said.
"Sen. John McCain, R- Ariz., asked on ABC's
This Week if the U.S. has the resources for the
military to take the lead in disaster recovery.
'We're capable of doing it, but have no doubt
that there is a strain on the Guard in particular
because of their requirements to be deployed to
Iraq,' said the senator, a Vietnam War veteran.
<span class="bluetext">(((I'd be guessing we run out of soldiers well
before the ocean runs out of storms.)))</span>
"McCain also expressed concern over the projected
surge in government spending  <span class="bluetext">(((There's that "surge"
buzzword again)))</span> in the wake of the two storms, saying
the federal budget deficit may reach more than
$500 billion this year.  <span class="bluetext">(((Someday they're gonna
wake up and realize that Kyoto was cheaper than
losing New Orleans.)))</span><br><br>
<strong>"Gaps in preparedness</strong><br><br>
"Sen. Susan Collins, a Maine Republican and
chairwoman of the Homeland Security and Governmental
Affairs Committee, is conducting hearings to
examine the government recovery effort after Katrina.
"You would think four years after 9/11, with
billions of dollars spent to improve our emergency
preparedness, that the response to Katrina would be
far crisper, far better coordinated and not marred
by failures at all levels of government,' Collins
said on CNN's Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer.
<span class="bluetext">(((At least this woman can emit coherent English.
I wonder what she'll say about the federal billions
that vanish sideways into New Orleans.  If they can't
even prepare for emergencies, how the heck are they
gonna rebuild?)))</span><br><br>
"Sen. Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut, the senior
Democrat on the Homeland and Government Affairs
Committee, called for creation of an independent
Sept. 11-type commission to examine the Katrina
response and the nation's general state of
emergency preparedness."<BR>
<A HREF="mailto:julie.mason@chron.com">julie.mason@chron.com</A><br><br>
<span class="bluetext">(((It's pathetic to listen to these clowns moan
and fingerpoint, while failing to ever raise
the issue of weather violence.)))</span><br><br>

<span class="bluetext">(((There's no cure for demolished cities that
a contemporary army can give.  A plethora of
Katrinas doesn't mean Army control of evacuation.
You can't park the populations of drowned cities
somewhere off camera while Delta Force rebuilds
their town.  The only effective response to really
savage and continuous weather violence has got to
be vigorous civil defense and a paramilitarized
general populace. Those millions of evacuees
who were cluttering  highways this week &ndash; they're
the labor force.  They and no one else are
the ones who will have to do the heavy lifting,
because it's their cities and their world that has
been destabilized by climate change.)))</span>
