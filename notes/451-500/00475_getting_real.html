<h2>Climate change: time to get real</h2>
<p>by Tom Burke<BR>
September 26, 2006</P>

<P>"The science is clear, the technology is available.
To meet the challenge of 'the most serious threat to humanity since the invention of 
nuclear weapons,'
climate-change campaigners now need to win the political argument, says Tom Burke of 
E3G.</P>

<P>Link:<BR>
<BR /><A HREF="http://www.e3g.org/index.php/about/Founders/">http://www.e3g.org/index.php/about/Founders/</A>
<span class="bluetext">(((Tom Burke is a career British green political who must be perfectly aware that the time 
to "get real" about weather violence was about thirty years ago.  What the heck, carry 
on!)))</span></P>


<P>"The public argument on climate change has been transformed by a series of recent 
interventions by scientists. First, James E Hansen, the global doyen of climate scientists,
 announced that the world has only ten years in which to take decisive action on the 
climate.</P>

<P>"'I think we have a very brief window of opportunity to deal with climate change ... no 
longer than a decade, at the most,' he told the Climate Change Research Conference in 
Sacramento, California.&Acirc; </P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Hansen may be right... or it may be time to figure out who to abduct and torture 
after the 'window of opportunity' stays nailed shut.  But wait, that would be the glorious 
job of the US Congress!)))</span></P>

<P>"Second, John P Holdren, the incoming president of the American Association for the 
Advancement of Science, said in his inaugural address that the world is already 
experiencing dangerous climate change.</P>


<P>"Third, Britain's national academy of science, the Royal Society, sent a letter to the 
oil company ExxonMobil asking it to stop supporting organisations that were deliberately 
distorting the science of climate change.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((A stern letter from the Royal Society!  I reckon they're trembling in their 
snakeskin boots over at Exxon's Texan HQ.)))</span>
<BR /><A HREF="http://environment.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,,1876538,00.html?gusrc=rss&feed=1">http://environment.guardian.co.uk/climatechange/story/0,,1876538,00.html?gusrc=rss&amp;feed=1</A>
<span class="bluetext">(((Kind of an interesting letter, though.)))</span></P>

<P>"We are much more accustomed to scientists entering the public debate about risk to say 
that our fears are exaggerated. There is no precedent for the kind of interventions we are 
now witnessing.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((An entire scientific intelligentsia being wiped out by Lysenkoism springs to mind, 
but that may not be a "precedent" that our author is eager to contemplate.)))</span></P>


<P>"They are a mark of the growing panic within the scientific community at the deepening 
abyss between what they know about the climate and what governments are doing.</P>

<P>"Two things are now becoming clear. The climate is changing faster, and the impacts of 
this change are going to be nastier, than we first thought."</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((A few change-impacts, like, for instance, these, thoughtfully assembled last month 
by Arlington Institute.  It's a nothing deal to assemble reports like this now.  The 
change is coming much faster than anybody is managing to "get real.")))</span></P>

<P>"Scientists at the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in Boulder have now 
figured out how to project the results of global futures scenarios, based on sophisticated 
computer predictions &ndash; formerly just rows of numbers &ndash; as changing colors on a 5-foot 
sphere with the continents outlined on it.
A number of these spheres are now being installed in museums around the United States and 
the world, so the world can see what it's in for.</P>

<P>Forecast Puts Earth's Future under a Cloud -- (Guardian -- August 15, 2006)</P>

<P><BR /><A HREF="http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/story/0,,1844789,00.html">http://www.guardian.co.uk/science/story/0,,1844789,00.html</A></P>

<P>"More than half of the world's major forests will be lost if global temperatures rise 
by an average of 3C or more by the end of the century. This prediction comes from the most 
comprehensive analysis yet of the potential effects of human-made global warming.
Extreme floods, forest fires and droughts will also become more common over the next 200 
years as global temperatures rise owing to climate change."</P>

<P>Greenland Melt 'Speeding Up' -- (BBC -- August 11, 2006)</P>

<P><BR /><A HREF="http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4783199.stm?ls">http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/4783199.stm?ls</A></P>

<P>"The meltdown of Greenland's ice sheet is speeding up, satellite measurements show. 
Data from a NASA satellite show that the melting rate has accelerated since 2004.
If the ice cap were to completely disappear, global sea levels would rise by 6.5m (21 
feet)."</P>

<P>Aspen Trees in West Dying -- (ABC -- August 11, 2006)</P>

<P><BR /><A HREF="http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=2303937&CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312">http://abcnews.go.com/Technology/wireStory?id=2303937&amp;CMP=OTC-RSSFeeds0312</A></P>


<P>"A conservative estimate is that about 10 percent of the aspen in Colorado may have 
died or become afflicted with something in the past 5 to 10 years.
Possible causes include a fungus, hungry caterpillars, drought, man's interference with 
the natural cycle of forest fires, and even resurgent herds of hungry elk nibbling 
saplings to death.</P>

<P>More Frequent Heat Waves Linked to Global Warming -- (Washington Post -- August 04, 
2006)</P>

<P><BR /><A HREF="http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/03/AR2006080301489.html">http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/08/03/AR2006080301489.html</A></P>

<P>"Heat waves like those that have scorched Europe and the United States in recent weeks 
are becoming more frequent because of global warming, say scientists who have studied 
decades of weather records and computer models of past, present and future climate."</P>


<P><span class="bluetext">(((See?  Nowadays, any and every futurist can sound just like Viridian List!  Meanwhile,
 back to the political activist.)))</span></P>

<P><BR>
"The hole we're in</P>

<P>"But other, more hopeful, things are also becoming
clearer. We may no longer be able to avoid dangerous
climate change, but we can avoid catastrophic climate
change.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Or, if we trundle right along into 'catastrophic'
due to continued political incapacity, maybe we
can draw a firm line at 'apocalyptic.')))</span></P>

<P>"We already have the technologies we need to keep
the eventual temperature rise to around two degrees
Centigrade. But we need to deploy them with great
urgency.</P>

<P>"We also know that we can afford to do so. Economic
analyses of the cost of tackling climate change
suggest that it will require the equivalent of around
1% of GDP. This is well within the margin of error of
these figures and would simply delay the arrival of
the same level of wealth by a few months.  <span class="bluetext">(((Unless
you're Exxon Mobil, in which case you're left in the
toilet because, in your infinite market wisdom, you
never did a thing about green energy.)))</span></P>

<P>"Estimates of the economic damage resulting from a
rapidly changing climate are often five times as much.
It will not cost the earth to prevent catastrophic
climate change, but it will cost the earth not to do
so.  <span class="bluetext">(((The Earth doesn't pay the bills for denial
lobbyists.)))</span></P>

<P>"The problem is neither the economics nor the
technology: it's the politics.</P>

<P>"Preventing catastrophic climate change requires
nothing less than the complete transformation of
the global energy system in the next forty years.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Actually, we're gonna get that change either way:
we either rebuild the global energy system, or else
it catches fire, blows over and drowns.)))</span></P>

<P>"We must both reduce our dependence on fossil fuels
and stop the carbon from the fossil fuels we do use
from entering the atmosphere.  <span class="bluetext">(((You'd think that
Members of Parliament had built all those smokestacks
personally.  Are smokestacks in the Magna Carta?)))</span></P>

<P>"We currently add about seven billion tonnes of
carbon to the atmosphere each year. If we continue
to fuel our expanding economy as we do today this
will become fourteen billion tonnes a year by 2050.
<span class="bluetext">(((I'm trying to think of a witty remark to make
about fourteen billion annual tons of carbon.
Let me know if you have one.)))</span></P>

<P>"Agriculture adds another two-and-a-half billion
tonnes that cannot easily be removed. The oceans and
plants annually absorb some five billion tonnes of
that carbon. By 2050, therefore, we must remove
eleven-and-a-half billion tonnes of carbon a year
from our economy, emitting close to zero from our
energy use. Then we have to keep it there, effectively
for ever.</P>

<P>"This is certainly a daunting prospect. But the
consequences of failure are terrifying. <span class="bluetext">(((The
future is a kind of slider-bar between 'daunting'
and 'terrifying.')))</span></P>

<P>"In the face of such difficulty there is much glib
talk about adaptation. Some suggest that instead of
trying to meet such a difficult challenge, we should
concentrate our efforts on learning to live with a
changing climate. This is a shallow and deceitful
proposal.</P>

<P>"It is a fantasy to expect already fragile governments
in the poorest parts of Africa and Asia to peacefully
manage and adapt to the disruption (including
migration) caused by climate change. The politics of
insecurity in countries affected there will erupt into
factionalism and conflict; Darfur is already one stark
example of this reality.</P>

<P>"Californians may be able to adapt to the loss of melt
waters from the Sierra Nevada by building hugely
expensive, and energy-intensive, desalination plants.
But that option will not be available to the hundreds
of millions of Indians and Pakistanis who depend on
Himalayan melt waters.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Okay, the Pakistanis are a basket-case, but I'm
inclined to think that the Bangalore contingent might
be much BETTER at this than the Silicon Valley crowd.
I mean, just look at Vinod Khosla.)))</span></P>

<P>"Some adaptation will be inevitable, as the climate
is already changing. We who live in the rich world
must be willing to help the poorest among us to deal
with the consequences of climate change; this is an
additional and obligatory, not a discretionary,
responsibility for the industrialised nations that
have benefited most from the profligate use of fossil fuels.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Kind of in the same brilliant, noblesse-oblige
fashion that advanced industrial Britain is
already aiding and helping backward Iraq.)))</span></P>

<P>"Since adaptation is not an option, we must address
head on the difficult politics of prevention. The
first step is to recognise that climate change is
not just another environmental problem. It is a
fundamental threat to prosperity and security.</P>

<P>"An unstable climate threatens the social and
political stability on which all prosperity depends.
Equity will suffer as the poorest are hit first and
worst. Opportunity will contract rather than expand
as the stresses of a rapidly changing climate
divide rather than unite nations and communities.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((The collapse of civilization isn't really an
equity issue. That probably plays well with the Labour
Party, though.)))</span></P>

<P>"Politics is often referred to as the art of the
possible. Meeting the climate challenge means
expanding the realm of the possible dramatically.
David King, chief scientific advisor to Britain's
prime minister, is right to say that climate change
is a bigger problem than global terrorism.</P>

<P>"In fact, it is the most serious threat to humanity
since the invention of nuclear weapons. In developing
and responding to that threat the world has invested
many trillions of pounds over the past sixty years.
To respond to climate change, we have yet to invest
more than a few billion.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((The key distinction is that we&acirc;re not actually
in a real-life, ongoing, steadily mounting nuclear
exchange.  Though I certainly wouldn't write one
off if there's no snow in the mountains of
India, California and everywhere else.)))</span></P>

<P><BR>
"The way out</P>

<P>"It is time for those engaged in the battle for a
stable climate to get real. Political battles are
essentially battles for resources.  <span class="bluetext">(((And if
you watch those pipelines exploding, you can
see that the same truism goes for actual battles.)))</span></P>

<P>"We face a shared dilemma. To ensure wellbeing for
a growing population with unfulfilled needs and
rising expectations we must grow our economies.
Should we fail, conflict and insecurity will be
the result.</P>

<P>"To grow our economies we must continue<BR>
to use more energy. Much of that energy will be in
the form of fossil fuels. If we use more fossil
fuels we will accelerate climate change. If the
climate changes rapidly we will destroy the very
prosperity and security we are trying to build.</P>

<P>"There is a way out from this narrow ground between
rock and hard place. It involves the very rapid
expansion of energy efficiency, of biofuels and
other renewables and of carbon capture and storage.</P>

<P>"Left to itself, the $17 trillion that will be
invested in energy technologies by 2050 will add
the other seven billion tonnes of carbon a year to
the atmosphere. To keep our climate stable we are
going to have spend enough public money to make
those technologies carbon-neutral.</P>

<P>"This will be easier than many think. A relatively
small carbon tax will yield vast amounts of revenue.
That revenue can be dedicated to paying the
difference between carbon-intensive technologies
and those which are carbon-neutral. As the switch
is made, the need for the revenue will decline and
the tax can be reduced.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Alternately, you can simply INVADE countries
emitting carbon, which seems like a likelier
scenario once things start hitting the fan.)))</span></P>

<P>"Europe currently spends 46% of its annual budget
on a problem it has already solved: food security.
It spends practically nothing on a problem that
threatens the livelihoods and wellbeing of every
single citizen in the union: climate security.</P>

<P>"It is time to look to the future rather than
remain trapped in the past. That means a radical
reallocation of European funds from the common
agricultural policy into a climate security fund.</P>

<P>"Some of this can, of course, be spent to enhance
the role farmers can play in preventing climate
change.  <span class="bluetext">(((Fewer butter mountains and wine lakes,
more cellulosic European ethanol.  Plus ca change,
plus ce la meme chose.)))</span></P>

<P>"Successful campaigning requires the relentless
hammering away at a deliverable goal that can easily
be understood. The present cacophony of ideas coming
from climate campaigners simply confuses the public
and lets governments off the hook. <span class="bluetext">(((Hmmmm.)))</span></P>

<P>"Good campaigning builds public awareness and then
leverages it to compel specific actions. There is
no shortage of public awareness about the threat to
the climate. But this has not yet been leveraged
by the campaigners.</P>

<P>"It is now time they focused that awareness on three
simple questions: how much governments need to spend,
on what, and by when."</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((I like it that he ends this by blaming scatter-
brained enviros.  Still, there's little in this
urging to "get real" that is new to Viridian readers.
It's a grim warning, but there's not a lot of skin
in it.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((That's why I append this NEXT opinion piece,
by a Katrina survivor.  This guy is an American
business manager and he probably votes Republican.
He doesn't breathe a word in his speech about climate
change; he's just suffering it.  He represents the
true avant-garde of weather violence: people catching
it right in the neck with a glum inability to grasp the
cause of their decline.   He is the kind of guy  who
needs comprehensive convincing if anything "real" is
to happen in reducing future sufferings.  If he
"gets real," the rest will follow.)))</span></P>

<P>Speech to the ISA Convention<BR>
by Lee Eagan</P>

<P>INDUSTRIAL DISTRIBUTION magazine, June 1, 02006</P>

<P>(. . . )</P>

<P>"The city that I love and that many of you love is
a shell of its former self.</P>

<P>"Eighty percent (not 8) of the city flooded, with
as much as 20 feet of water.</P>

<P>"Two hundred fifty thousand homes, not houses, were
damaged, most beyond repair.</P>

<P>"Five hundred thousand automobiles were flooded,
many still remain on the streets.</P>

<P>"I live 5 blocks from Tulane University and half
a block from the St. Charles Ave streetcar line.</P>

<P>"a. The water stopped 2 blocks from my house.</P>

<P>"b. 8 miles from my house, north to the lake &ndash; very
few houses you can live in.</P>

<P>"c. 23 miles to the East (towards Mississippi) very
few, if any, houses you can live in.</P>

<P>"d. My family has long had a presence in Bay St. Louis.
These houses on the water had survived all major
hurricanes, including Camille.  They are gone.  You
need a GPS to determine where a house was. Complete
devastation.</P>

<P>"e. The wonderful, beautiful antebellum homes on the
Gulf in Mississippi, were not 'damaged,' they were
eliminated.  Miles and miles of nothing.</P>

<P>"But many of you know this, what you do not know,
is where are we now.  <span class="bluetext">(((June 02006.)))</span></P>

<P>"Complete neighborhoods are still void of life.  No
attempt to rebuild.</P>

<P>"There is a critical housing shortage. People have
nowhere to live. Many FEMA trailers are installed,
but many people do not have keys, and if they do,
they must evacuate when the winds rise above 40 MPH.</P>

<P>"Water service in some areas of the city is dangerously
low and cannot support additional usage. Eighty
percent of the water system is compromised.</P>

<P>"Public schools in Orleans Parish are basically
non-existent. Many damaged beyond repair.</P>

<P>"Louisiana's labor force has shrunk every month since
November. The unemployment rate of those that remain
displaced is 35%.  The well being of the hundreds of
thousands of people still displaced by Katrina
continues to be in doubt.</P>

<P>"Medical care is unacceptably primitive. Only two
hospitals in Orleans Parish are open, and these
are smaller hospitals. The large private and
public hospitals were destroyed, not to be re-opened.</P>

<P>"Doctors are unable to make a living and are
leaving the City.</P>

<P>"Last week our controller had to be rushed by
ambulance to one of the hospitals open. The hospital
re-directed the ambulance to a hospital 40 miles
away, because they could not take him, as the wait
in the emergency room was 10-12 hours.</P>

<P>"With significantly less population, there were 25%
more death notices in the paper in Jan 2006 than
in Jan 2005.  Medical professionals (and I quote)
have said 'stress, exacerbating underlying health
issues, is blamed for many of these deaths.'</P>

<P>"Post traumatic stress disorder and suicide are
urgent public health issues.</P>

<P>"Many businesses are still trying to recover
from 8-10 weeks of no cash receipts.</P>

<P>"Mail is very unreliable. I have not received a
Wall Street Journal since Pre K.</P>

<P>"Both medical schools in New Orleans are in danger
of losing their accreditation because of lack of
patients, hospitals and people.</P>

<P>"Employees are very difficult to find.  The days
of $8-10 hour people are history.</P>

<P>"Places to eat lunch are scarce. Many restaurants
are open only a few days a week, with limited hours,
some close by 8PM. Commander's, Mr. B's and Emeril's
Delmonico have been and remain closed.</P>

<P>"Grocery stores have limited hours and have no one
to stock the shelves.</P>

<P>"Fifty percent of the stoplights are still dark.</P>

<P>"Blue Roofs are still the most prevalent color in
the region.</P>

<P>"People have exceeded their frustration levels in
fighting with insurance companies. Most people and
companies have not, nine months later, reached a
settlement.</P>

<P>"Insurance companies are not writing new business
and are raising rates to unheard of levels, with
significantly lower limits, in order to flee the area.</P>

<P>"In addition, the fine print now excludes wind and
hail.</P>

<P>"The cost of construction and construction related
materials have increased over 100% since Katrina.</P>

<P>"Our utility provider has gone bankrupt and with
the loss of 50- 60% of its customer base is raising
rates as much as 2.6 times in order to spread the
cost over fewer customers.</P>

<P>"City services are a joke.  Grass is not cut;
garbage is once a week if you are lucky.</P>

<P>"Our Governor is an embarrassment.  She does not have
a clue. It takes her 4 hours to watch '60 MINUTES.'</P>

<P>"Our mayor, by his actions, has basically asked 42%
of the population and 80% of the small businesses to
leave. Taxes are still being assessed, with no plan
for change, on destroyed property. Assuming that he
does not get re-elected today, he probably should
apply for a job working on the Hershey Chocolate
candy line.</P>

<P>"Our political issues are our own fault, but there
are significant issues that belong to FEMA and the
Corps of Engineers.</P>

<P>"The Corps of Engineers is responsible for levee
protection. Although we had patronizing levee boards,
in the end it is the Corps, by law, it is their
responsibility to protect us from flooding.  <span class="bluetext">(((Even
if Greenland melts?  Well, yeah!  Legal is legal.)))</span></P>

<P>"The Corps must take responsibility for their
failure to properly supervise the construction of
both the levees and the retaining walls.</P>

<P>"A hurricane can be hell. But the good people of New
Orleans &ndash; we were not devastated by the storm,
rather it was the failure of the Corps to properly
design and build and supervise the construction of
the levee system and retaining walls that decimated us.
<span class="bluetext">(((He's gotta blame somebody for the decimation.
But suppose the Army Corps of Engineers gets abolished.
Where's New Orleans then?)))</span></P>

<P>"Be not mistaken, Katrina was a bitch. In 12 hours
fifty percent of the barrier island system and wetlands
that protect Louisiana, Mississippi and Texas was
eliminated. Each 2.7 miles of wetlands reduce the
storm surge by 1 foot. Half of it is gone, not to
return in my lifetime. This means that a 2006 Cat 2
storm could create as much devastation and a 2005
Cat 3 storm. <span class="bluetext">(((He's tantalizingly close to catching
on!)))</span></P>
