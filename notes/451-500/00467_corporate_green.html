<P>US Hurricanes May Wipe Out 20-40 Insurers &ndash; AM Best</P>

<P>US: June 2, 2006</P>

<P>"NEW YORK &ndash; The US hurricane season kicked off
Thursday with another gloomy prediction: major storms
could cause US$100 billion worth of property loss,
and wipe out 20 to 40 insurers. (...)</P>

<P>"'This will take a bigger bite out of the industry
than the 1906 San Francisco earthquake,' Williams said.
Insurance costs from last year's major catastrophes,
or "megacats" &ndash; Hurricanes Katrina, Rita and Wilma &ndash;
have already reached US$58 billion, with some claims
still in court. In addition, federal aid to rebuild
areas such as New Orleans, which was flooded by
Katrina, will top US$100 billion, Best said."</P>

<P>"ANALYSIS &ndash; Is Corporate America Going Green?</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((In a word, no, and in a lot of words, they're
going green in their own very corporate way.)))</span></P>

<P>Story by Scott Malone</P>

<P>US: June 5, 2006</P>

<P>"BOSTON &ndash; Corporate America, which once dismissed
fears about global warming as unfounded, appears to
be changing its mind, publicly acknowledging its
influence on climate change and striving for a
greener image.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((The interesting part comes when "corporate America"
starts striving, not for some "better image," but
striving not to be blown away at hurricane
wind speeds topping 170 miles an hour.  Business can't
very well ask the government to help them, because
they already acquired all the regulatory bodies.
Besides, neocons and fundies clearly have no
idea what to do about climate change. They literally
can't see it, any more than the antebellum South
could see slavery as a problem.</P>

<P>((So the megacorps are not going green in order to
suck-up to adbusters, Seattle 99ers and  the
LOHAS contingent. They'll have to do it in order
not to see their markets and infrastructure
physically destroyed.)))</span></P>

<P>"Major companies such as General Electric Co. and
chemicals maker DuPont Co. are taking steps to make
their plants and products more energy efficient and
to reduce emissions of the greenhouse gases linked
to global warming.</P>

<P>"To be sure, US companies have heavily promoted their
change of heart in slick marketing campaigns such as
Ford Motor Co.'s 'I guess it is easy being green'
television advertisements for its Escape hybrid
sport utility vehicle.</P>

<P>Link:<BR>
What's good for America is good for GM, "a crack
dealer looking to keep his addicts on a tight leash."

<P>"Environmental activists say the changes go beyond
lip service but they urge lawmakers to prod companies
along even faster through tougher environmental
regulations.  <span class="bluetext">((("Environmental activists" always
want to hustle business through the tongs of the
EPA, in order not to actually get any capitalism
splattered on themselves.  Why not just go explain
to Wal-Mart that they, Wal-Mart, are a tender,
vulnerable, overextended network that is  sure  to die
in any serious climate chaos?  Looks like Wal-Mart
may have caught on to this fact already.)))</span>

<P>"'We've barely just begun, but what we've begun is
real,' said Mindy Lubber, president of Ceres, a
Boston-based coalition of institutional investors
and environmental groups that manages more than
US$3 trillion in assets.  ((Three trillion for the
time being, that is.  A hundred billion loss here,
a hundred billion loss there, hey, that adds up.)))</span></P>

<P>"Many scientists  <span class="bluetext">(((come on, Planet Ark, it's
perfectly okay to say "all of them."  All the
scientists.  If they say otherwise, they're not
scientists)))</span> say a build-up of greenhouse gas
emissions caused by burning fossil fuels such as
oil and coal are raising temperatures around the
world and could bring catastrophic changes &ndash;
from severe heatwaves to rising seas.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((The severe heatwaves are already years old.
That's not a change that CO2 "could bring."  We're
simmering in it.  The Fortune 500 is smack in the
middle of it.  It's not like they get to offshore
into a walled Wal-Mart bunker on another planet.
Unless they've somehow got "Halliburton
SurvivaBalls.")))</span><BR>

<br /><a href="http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=13568">http://www.corpwatch.org/article.php?id=13568</A></P>

<P>"For many years, major US corporations asserted
that natural swings in temperature made it
impossible to tell whether greenhouse gas
emissions were influencing the climate.
With some notable exceptions &ndash; including oil
giant Exxon Mobil Corp. &ndash; US companies have
noticeably changed their tune.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((It wasn't "companies" per se who were into
Greenhouse denial. Specifically, was the oil,
gas, chemical, and auto  industries who logjammed
Kyoto in the US Senate.  They were  heartily joined,
by the way, by US labor unions who figured that Kyoto
would export American jobs.   Now the unions don't
have the jobs  OR the climate.  The oil and gas guys
are knee-deep in blood. The American auto guys can't
find customers for their ludicrous SUV behemoths.
Ace way to run an economy, fellas.  You cats
are real capitalist geniuses.)))</span></P>

<P>"Fairfield, Connecticut,-based GE &ndash; the world's
second-largest company by market value &ndash; last
year unveiled its 'Ecomagination' initiative to
cut greenhouse gas emissions and increase sales of
energy-efficient products.</P>

<P>"Sales of 'Ecomagination' products, ranging from
washing machines to jet engines, reached US$10.1
billion last year and GE aims to double that by
2010.  <span class="bluetext">(((That goal oughta be pretty easy if the dollar
hyperinflates and a Yankee GE washing-machine costs a
dozen euros.)))</span> It also aims to double its
research spending on such products to US$1.5
billion by 2010.</P>

<P>"'Our customers are heavy energy users, customers
that have fuel issues, that are seeking energy
efficiency,' said Lorraine Bolsinger,  a GE vice
president who heads up  the Ecomagination program.
'When we talk to our  customers, they tell us,
'This is what we need.' <span class="bluetext">((("Or we, uh, die.")))</span></P>

<P>"Fears that a warmer, wetter planet would spawn
devastating storms like Hurricane Katrina, which
flooded much of New Orleans and killed more than
1,500 people in Louisiana alone, have also caused
insurers to shift thinking on global warming.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Caused them to "shift thinking"?  It's caused
them to go broke.)))</span></P>

<P>"American International Group Inc., the world's top
insurance company by market value, said in May &ndash;
after losing US$2 billion after tax from Katrina
and other disasters last year &ndash; that it would
develop projects to keep greenhouse gases out
of the atmosphere.</P>

<P>Naturally these insurance agents prefer "market-
based environmental policies."  Do those sound warmer
and cuddlier than government regulation, somehow?

<P>"REGULATION THE NEXT STEP?  <span class="bluetext">(((Why even bother?)))</span></P>

<P>"A tripling in oil prices to record highs above
US$70 a barrel is also accelerating the drive
for greater efficiency.  <span class="bluetext">(((Blowback from that
effort to "regulate" Iraq.)))</span></P>

<P>"DuPont has cut its energy bill by about US$3
billion since kicking off an emissions-reduction
campaign in the early 1990s, said Edwin Morgan,
director of energy and environment at the Wilmington,
Delaware,-based company. It has cut its greenhouse
gas emissions by more than 72 percent over that time.
<span class="bluetext">(((Dupont has therefore beaten the Kyoto Accords by
something like a factor of seven.  Do you suppose
that the US Senate has reduced its emissions that
much?  I know I haven't.)))</span></P>

<P>"Ceres, in a March study, ranked DuPont's efforts
to reduce global warming second only to British
petroleum firm BP Plc among major global companies.
US greenhouse gas emissions have continued to rise
since the White House declared in 2001 that the US
would not abide by the terms of the United Nations'
Kyoto Protocol to cut such emissions below 1990
levels by 2008.  <span class="bluetext">(((Well, if the US suffers
massive storm damage, plus currency hyperinflation,
a real-estate bubble and a military defeat, that
trifling Kyoto problem will pretty well
take care of itself.)))</span></P>

<P>"While observers lauded the steps taken by US
companies in industries ranging from chemicals
to electric utilities, they said the only
reliable way to reduce US greenhouse gas
emissions would be regulation.  <span class="bluetext">(((Okay: name
one "reliable" regulation that has happened
in American governance in the last six years.
If there <STRONG>were</STRONG> greenhouse regulations in the US,
who would enforce them?  Halliburton.  Who else?)))</span></P>

<P>"'One company doesn't want to go alone. They want
to move forward as industries,' said Brendan Bell,
global warming analyst at the Sierra Club, a
major US environmental group. <span class="bluetext">(((This sounds like
"oligopoly" and "conspiracy in restraint of trade,"
which is, of course, completely doable.)))</span></P>

<P>"Some investors have begun petitioning companies
to fight global-warming-related regulation. The
Free Enterprise Action Fund, a US$6 million mutual
fund, through proxy proposals asked GE and J.P.
Morgan Chase &amp; Co. this year to fight such regulation.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((With a name like that, "Free Enterprise Action Fund"
have got to be another Exxon-Mobil sock puppet.
Yep.  They are. Took me and Google all of 15 seconds
to find that out.)))</span><BR>

<P>"'Global warming activists are using these guys to
get these laws passed. And once the laws are in
effect, they are going to get more and more intrusive,
and they're not going to be able to control them,'
said Steve Milloy, a portfolio manager.  <span class="bluetext">(((Steve
Milloy is not a "portfolio manager," he's into climate
denial, among a host of other weird things.)))</span>

<P>"Bolsinger said GE would be able to compete even
in a tighter regulatory environment.</P>

<P>"'Without some kind of legislation, we don't see
that there's going to be significant progress made,'
Bolsinger said. 'We're not afraid of whatever
regulation will come.'</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((It doesn't make any sense to wait for political
reform before tackling climate change. Even
if Gore were President and the USA went whole hog
for Kyoto, the day is long gone when the Washington
Consensus swayed the world and there was any tacit
notion that the world would do what the UN said.
There's not enough talent, authority or technical
capacity left in the planet's political class.
The ultra-rich and the marketeers are the only people
who can move fast enough to save their own skins.
Where they can make it, it'll be Corporate Green
and haute-green. Where they can't make it, but
can't give up, it'll be  Ninth Ward and Khaki Green.
Where the failure is total, it'll be Long Emergency
and Planet of Slums.)))</span></P>
