<P>New ubicomp book by Adam Greenfield, titled "Everyware."</P>

<h2>Spime Watch II</h2>

<P><strong>'The Internet of Places/ Das Netzwerk Der Orte.'</strong></P>

<P>'Hello Mr. Sterling!</P>

<P>'We are two graphic design students from Germany, who tried
to visualize some of the experiences and dangers which localized
internet-applications running on mobiles or head-up-displays
could bring in the near future.'</P>


<P>'We are not actually working on the interface-design of this
"internet of places" as we call it referring to your term of
the "internet of things", but try to make more abstract
visualizations which transport the idea of an augmented
reality based on hyperlinking places or things.'</P>

<P>"Effects of Pervasive Computing on Sustainable Development"</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.patmedia.net/tbookman/techsoc/Koehler.htm">http://www.patmedia.net/tbookman/techsoc/Koehler.htm</A></P>


<P>"Physical contact with microelectronics can cause health risks
as well. With the growing number of devices worn closely to the
human body, a more intensive dermal contact with the surface of
these products (polymers with additives) is inevitable. Grit
and effluvium can be reabsorbed or inhaled during longer
periods. Due to the wide range of substances used for
microelectronics the risk of allergic reactions or chronic
poisoning increases.</P>

<P>"There are possible side effects of active implants that are
still unexplored:</P>

<P>"Health reactions to substances that are dissolved from the
implant surface;</P>

<P>"Influence on functionality and behavior of cells, which are
in direct contact with the implant surface (protein adsorption
or denaturation on the implant surface);</P>

<P>"Mechanical stress within the body tissues surrounding the
implant;</P>

<P>"Disturbance of cell-cell interaction caused by electrical
or optical activity;</P>

<P>"Effects of high local NIR exposure in very small areas within
body tissue caused by active implants.</P>

<P>"Those risks can be influenced by design engineering of implant
wrapping and clinical tests. There is need for further research
in this field."</P>

<P>"Our use of metrics in the game industry is nigh on nonexistent.
We know close to nothing about how exactly people play our
games. Despite the fact that we play on connected computers,
running software that is full of event triggers that could be
datamined, we still playtest by locking a few dozen people in
a room and asking them what they think. Regarded in that
fashion, it's simply astounding that the games are working
at all.'</P>

Marc Tuters and Kazys Varnelis</P>

<P>"Broadly speaking, locative media projects can be categorized
under one of two types of mapping, either annotative &ndash;
virtually tagging the world &ndash; or phenomenological&ndash;tracing
the action of the subject in the world. Roughly, these two
types of locative media&ndash;annotative and tracing&ndash;correspond to
two archetypal poles winding their way through late 20th
century art, critical art and phenomenology, perhaps otherwise
figured as the twin Situationist practices of detournement and
the derive."</P>

<P>Bruce:</P>

<P>"I'm loving your work.  I thought you would appreciate
this selection of terms for your 'loose verbal grab-bag.'  
Most are found, some borrowed and some have been invented. </P>

<P>"I'm currently working on a PhD thesis based on the notion
that there a hybrid area of practice is emerging around the
convergence of sculpture, industrial design and architecture. 
I am asserting that new sets of creative, cultural and
economic conditions have stimulated intriguing levels of
inquiry by creative practitioners to work across two or more
of these domains and to seek out and use technologies that
facilitate a particular blurring between these disciplines. </P>

<P>"My hunch is that this convergence (enabled and accelerated
by computer visualisation and manufacturing processes)
signifies a multidirectional morphing of disciplines and
the opportunity to create fundamentally new types of
designed object and practice that eclipse conventional
tropes." <span class="bluetext">(((I want the T-shirt.)))</span></P>

<h2>
Spime Watch XI: Changing Attitudes Toward Shopping</h2>

<P>The "Internet of Things" bibliography, thoughtfully and industriously compiled by Anne 
Galloway of <a href="http://worldchanging.com">Worldchanging.com</a>.</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.purselipsquarejaw.org/2006/03/internet-of-things-working.php">http://www.purselipsquarejaw.org/2006/03/internet-of-things-working.php</A></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((The Guardian is noticing that availability, ubiquity and
the willingness to tell others about bargains is affecting
our attitude toward physical possessions. I would describe
this as a segue away from "consuming" and into 21st-century
"wrangling." It's the unaddressed sustainability problem
that makes that click.)))</span></P>

<P>
<A HREF="http://www.guardian.co.uk/retail/story/0,,1719765,00.html?gusrc=rss">http://www.guardian.co.uk/retail/story/0,,1719765,00.html?gusrc=rss</A></P>

<P>"How is the era of the L3 handbag affecting our attitudes
to possessions? Are we happier or less content with what
we have? Are cheap goods liberating or imprisoning? And
what &ndash; once we've bought them, and especially once
we've finished with them &ndash; do we do with them all?</P>

<P>"Gareth Coombs of the Cambridge Strategy Centre, a retail
consultancy, sees the social implications: 'People used to
define themselves as shopping at a certain level. 'I'm an
M&amp;S shopper.' It defined your place in the world. Those
sort of rules aren't sustainable any more.' Tamar Kasriel
of the Henley Centre, the social forecasters, is blunter:
'The idea that cheap goods are for poor people is totally
history.'</P>

<P>"Factory outlets, like the low-cost airlines that started up
in Britain in the mid-1990s, taught people that the price of
goods was not written in stone but subject to context and,
in particular, the balance of power between seller and buyer.</P>

<P>"Coombs and other analysts talk about the satisfaction felt
by consumers when they 'get a victory' over a retailer &ndash;
and when they tell their friends about it afterwards. The
latter activity, in a sure sign of its popularity, has
recently acquired a would-be scientific label: 'compulsive
price disclosure.'  <span class="bluetext">(((The folk version of "transparent
production.)))</span></P>

<P>"You could see all this hoarding as a sign of a growing
attachment to possessions. But Coombs sees it as the opposite.
'What was in the living room this year will be in the bedroom
next year and in the junk room the year after,' he says.
Kasriel says the chance to sell to eBay has boosted much we
buy. 'You can tell yourself you have a sensible financial
route out.</P>

<P>"Unashamedly 'disposable' cheap goods, you could argue, are
turning us into traders rather than curators of our possessions.
It is another victory for capitalism: we have internalised the
unsentimental stock control of the modern retailer. <span class="bluetext">(((Or, you
might describe it as a growing awareness that shoppers are
dealing  with the material manifestations of an immaterial
system,  and that they are learning to wrangle that system
rather than get all hypnotized by one cheap handbag out of
a zillion possible handbags.)))</span></P>
