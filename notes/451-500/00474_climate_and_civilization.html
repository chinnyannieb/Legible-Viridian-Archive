<h2>
"Climate Change Forged First Civilizations &ndash; Scientist</h2>


<P>"UK: September 8, 2006</P>

<P>
"NORWICH, England &ndash; The earliest civilizations were
not a product of favourable conditions but rather
a last resort in the face of dramatic shifts in the weather,
a climate scientist said on Thursday.</P>

<P>
"Flying in the face of accepted theory that settled
societies emerged from the development of static
farming in good climatic conditions that produced
food surpluses and allowed specialisation, Nick
Brooks said the opposite was true.</P>

<P>"Beyond Collapse," a paper by Nick Brooks detailing
how climate calamity can turn everyday primitives into
a high-tech race of civilized authoritarian slaves.
"It has been noted that the rise of Dynastic
civilisation in Egypt coincided with the onset of
widespread Saharan desiccation," etc etc.

<P>"'Civilisation did not arise as the result of a
benign environment which allowed humanity to indulge
a preference for living in complex, urban civilised
societies,' he told the annual meeting of the
British Association for the Advancement of Science.</P>

<P>"'On the contrary, what we tend to think of today
as civilisation was an accidental by-product of
unplanned adaptation to catastrophic climate
change. Civilisation was a last resort,' he added.</P>

<P>"Brooks said he based his theory on close observation
of archaeological remains of the Garamantian
civilization in the Fezzan region of south-western
Libya allied with evidence of changing rainfall
patterns 3,000-5,000 years ago.</P>

The Garamantians, miners of fossil water.  There's
one for the books, Dr. Diamond!</P>

<P>"But he said the pattern could also be found in societies as
diverse as South Asia, South America and China.</P>

<P>"As the climate became steadily drier formerly nomadic
people were forced to come together for mutual support
and to eke out the dwindling natural resources.
But not all of the consequences of this merging movement
were beneficial &ndash; social inequality arose as did organised
violence, there was no increase in life expectancy and
autocratic governments emerged, Brooks said.</P>

<P>"When climate conditions improved again there was no
return to the former order.</P>

<P>"'Once the cat is out of the bag, it doesn't go back.
You can't uninvent technology,' Brooks said.
<span class="bluetext">(((Unless you collapse, like the Garamantians did.)))</span></P>

<P>"And he warned against drawing comparisons with
the global warming that is predicted to raise average
temperatures by around three degrees this century,
noting that the temperature rise was well above that
which forced the societal change 5,000 years ago."</P>
