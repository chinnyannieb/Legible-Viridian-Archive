"From an inconsequential percentage of venture
dollars allocated  to this sector in prior years,
clean technology now boasts the  third-highest
investment category within the entire venture
asset class. This category, which was not even
on the venture  radar screen just a few short years
ago, has now overtaken  the semiconductor sector
in terms of dollars being invested."</P>

<P>It's not weird that Bob Metcalfe talks like an
old-school MIT techie, because he is one.  The
weird part is when Indians start talking like
Bob Metcalfe, and rather fluently, too.<br>

<H2>FRAMING THE FIRST MASSACHUSETT ENERGY SUMMIT</H2>

<P>For 8am-noon, Wednesday, December 13, 2006,
MIT Faculty Club</P>

<P>Speaking BEFORE me were (1) Paul O’Brien, Special
Assistant to the Massachusetts Secretary of Economic

Office of Government Community Relations, (3) Susan
Hockfield, President of MIT, and (4) Ernest Moniz,

Governor Elect.</P>

<A NAME="start"> </A>
<H2>START</H2>

<P>Good morning, thank you, and now for something
completely different.</P>

<P>Welcome to today's First Massachusetts Energy Summit.</P>

<P>Thanks to Governor Mitt Romney, Secretary Ranch
Kimball, Paul O'Brien, President Susan Hockfield,
and Professor Moniz for inviting me here today,
and I'm sorry if they soon REGRET it.</P>

<P>I am enthusiastic and grateful to be here. I signed
up to make five minutes of framing remarks, but in
preparing my notes, I've written several thousand
words, which I'll happily send, if you ask nicely.</P>

<P>Please excuse any lack of collegiality on my part.
Collegiality is not high on my priority list. After
decades of fighting the status quo, I am wary of
collegiality. Among the pathologies of collegiality
are old boy networks &ndash; entrenched, resourceful,
and nasty defenders of the status quo.</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;Energy is an emerging CLUSTER in the Commonwealth
of Massachusetts. Energy is emerging, we hope, like
other world-class clusters in the Massachusetts
economy. These include finance, defense, hospitals,
infotech, biotech, nanotech, Internet, robotics, and
RFID, to name a few, old and new.&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>


<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;No small factor in the emergence of Massachusetts
clusters is the nourishment provided by our state's
100+ colleges and 10+ world-class research
universities, including especially my alma mater,
the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, which has
taken up ENERGY as a major new university-wide
initiative.&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Please note: these MIT-soaked aggregations
are to be called CLUSTERS, not "good old boy
networks," a southern phenomenon  apparently
unknown to Massachusetts.)))</span></P>

<P>"I wrote years back in MIT Technology Review Magazine
that while INVENTION  is a FLOWER, INNOVATION is a
WEED. We innovators have to be willing to be viewed
as weeds by old boy  networks. Innovation, in my
experience, is not done  by old boy networks, but
by sometime collaborating and mostly COMPETING, and
annoying, teams of women  and men &ndash; scientists,
engineers, entrepreneurs, and  of course, venture
capitalists &ndash; call us "techies." I could stop there.</P>

<P>So, excuse me any lack of collegiality today &ndash;
we are INNOVATING here.</P>

<P>The hopeful theory behind risking these five minutes
with me is that I may have some useful advice for
the Massachusetts energy cluster after my decades
of striving and eventual success in Silicon Valley.
The Valley is a cluster of clusters, the envy of
economic developers around the world. In particular,
I am overflowing with advice from experience in
the Internet cluster, whose exact location remains
in doubt, as is its lasting impact since the
Internet Bubble burst.</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;There is controversy about when exactly the
Internet was invented, but I trace it back to a
Federal Communications Commission decision in 1968,
the Carterphone Decision, which began the breaking
of AT&amp;T's stranglehold on telecommunications.
Carterphone established FOCACA <span class="bluetext">((("freedom of
choice among competing alternatives")))</span> among
devices attached to AT&amp;T's telephone network. Then,
only five years later, in 1973, there came three
important inventions: the cellphone, the Internet's
modern protocols (TCP/IP), and the Internet's
plumbing, Ethernet.&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;All that FOCACA worked so well that, in 1984,
the AT&amp;T monopoly itself was broken up and, not so
coincidentally, the modern Internet started moving
up its inexorable exponential. We should worry
these days that AT&amp;T is reconsolidating, but that's
another story.&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;In 1964, IBM introduced its 360 mainframes to
secure its position as the dominant computer monopoly
&ndash; it was IBM and the BUNCH: Burroughs, Univac, NCR,
Control Data, and Honeywell. We would probably still
be stuck with IBM mainframes batch processing punched
cards had it not been for federal government antitrust
oversight through the 1970s. Thanks to the resulting
FOCACA, instead of just IBM and the BUNCH, we got
DEC, Data General, Wang, HP, Intel, Apple, Apollo,
Sun, Thinking Machines, Compaq, Microsoft, Oracle,
Cisco, Dell, and now SiCortex out in Maynard, to name
a few, and all of them connected, NOT through IBM's
System Network Architecture, but through the Internet.
SNA, R.I.P.&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>Rather than make comments about exactly which
innovations are going to solve the world's energy
problems, &lt;&lt;&lt;various forms of taxation, mitigation,
sequestration, gasification, biofuels, nuclear,
photosynthesis, photovoltaics, and hydrogen&gt;&gt;&gt;
in these five minutes I will try to stay
META, and talk about how to help our energy cluster
succeed.</P>

<P>Rather than lead with my own energy SILVER BULLET,
algae, here's my meta silver bullet:</P>

<P>freedom of choice among competing alternatives.</P>

<P>FOCACA for short. If it's progress you want, let
FOCACA reign. Down with monopolies and old boy
networks. Down with early political consensus picks
among people, technologies, or companies. Our energy
cluster will only prosper with FOCACA.</P>

<P>I am from what politicians and professors often call,
a little too dismissively, the "private sector."
I think nobody else but the private sector will meet
the world's energy needs. Yes, the underlying reasons
we are here today are the 100+ colleges and 10+
world-class research universities in Massachusetts.
Every economic cluster that I know about is near a
research university.</P>

<P>And then there are politicians &ndash; the public sector.
The big danger in what they call "policy making" is
that large companies have lobbyists and small companies
don't. Using an endless variety of rationales, the old
boy network of large company lobbyists and policy
makers make it difficult for young companies that
might compete with them and thereby drive accelerating
innovation. So, please be careful out there.</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;Two good examples from Internet history are ISDN
plumbing and ISO protocols. Both were infotech
technologies promoted by an old boy network, by the
old Bell System. Bell monopolists sent armies of
lobbyists to visit government officials explaining
how it was in everyone's best interest if their
monopolies were protected, and if not their monopolies
per se, then public safety, and if not safety, then
universal service, and if not that, then the jobs of
telephone workers in their geographies. Even I was
fooled for a while. Had ISDN and ISO been forced on
us by those unsuspecting government officials and me,
the Internet might still be among those perennial
technologies of the future.&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;Fortunately, FOCACA prevailed, and we got, not
ISDN and ISO, but after a series of long and fierce
competitions, we got the Internet's Ethernet plumbing
and TCP/IP protocols. I was tempted to say just then
that we "ended up" with the Internet's plumbing and
protocols, but of course FOCACA still prevails, and
the Internet's proliferation and evolution continues.
So should it be with energy in Massachusetts.&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;Even policies aimed at large companies can backfire
on  small innovation companies. For example, policies
that confiscate profits from "greedy" energy monopolies
are a bad idea. Such profits are typically grossly
exaggerated, but more importantly, investors will shy
away from situations where, if they succeed, their
returns will be confiscated. Profit confiscation
will bite your nose to spite your face, if it's
cheap and clean energy you want.&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<A NAME="not_energy,_enertech"> </A>
<H2>NOT ENERGY, ENERTECH</H2>

<P>At the risk of not being collegial, again, and maybe
even annoying Governor Romney and President Hockfield,
I'd like to point out THREE problems with the very
name of today’s First Massachusetts Energy Summit.</P>


<P>The FIRST problem with the name is the word FIRST.
This cannot be the first energy summit ever held in
Massachusetts, or even the first at MIT. We have a
long history of trying to meet the world's energy
needs. Let's be mindful that we have been here before.</P>

<P>The SECOND problem with the name of today's SUMMIT is
the word SUMMIT. Governors and Presidents often call
their gatherings summits, but this word has the wrong
connotations for solving problems. Again, the world's
energy needs will not be met top down near the summits
of any old boy networks, but solved &ndash; here's my
main message &ndash; bottom up, by young women and men,
sometimes collaborating but mostly in COMPETING teams
of scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs, and VCs.
In Silicon Valley, this is called coopetition.</P>

<P>And the THIRD problem with the name of this Energy
Summit is the word ENERGY. The cluster we are here
today discussing is not an "energy" cluster per se,
but an energy TECHNOLOGY cluster. It's not as if we
are planning to mine newly discovered coal deposits
out past Interstate 495. It's not that a spectacular
supply of wind has been found in Nantucket Sound.
It's not that Massachusetts is likely to become a
major energy exporter or even energy independent.
Instead, we are gathered today to discuss the
development of an economic cluster based on energy
TECHNOLOGY.</P>

<P>For example, while Massachusetts will EVENTUALLY
have thousands of windmills in somebody's backyards,
it's more important that our energy technologies are
used around the world for making, for example, windmill
BLADES. Massachusetts technologies will be used
worldwide in energy generation, distribution, storage,
and consumption.</P>

<P>So, rather than energy, I'll be saying energy
technology &ndash; ENERTECH for short. I mean to say
enertech as we already say infotech, biotech, and
nanotech. Add "enertech" to the list.</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;The trick, if you want actually to solve Global
Warming, is to keep clear the paths of people I'll
call "techies" &ndash; scientists, engineers, entrepreneurs,
and venture capitalists (including me). Techies are
the people who just took 30 years to build the Internet
and who will take about the same time to solve Global
Warming. They will solve Global Warming mostly by
developing technologies that deliver cheap and clean
energy. And they will do it SOONER if we can keep
alarmists and deniers out of their way, and let FOCACA
ring.&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;The science we need is best done, not by corporate
monopolies, not by government laboratories, but by
research universities, of which Massachusetts has
plenty.&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;In general, in the private sector, only monopolies
can afford basic research. AT&amp;T's telephone monopoly
supported Bell Labs. IBM's computer monopoly supported
Watson Labs. Xerox's copier monopoly supported Parc.
However, all the damage monopolies do, by overcharging
their customers and sitting on innovations, is NOT
worth what little research they do.&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;And government laboratories have become mostly
earmarked pork barrel jobs programs steeped in
mediocrity. Sorry, that wasn't very nice.&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;Research universities are the best place to do the
Earth and energy science we need because why?
Because they graduate people. People are the most
effective vehicles for technology transfer. It is
no accident that economic clusters tend to form
around excellent research universities.&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>I'll be calling it the MASSACHUSETTS ENERTECH CLUSTER.</P>

<A NAME="not_global_warming,_enertech"> </A>
<H2>NOT GLOBAL WARMING, ENERTECH</H2>

<P>The best way to frame the challenge before our Enertech
Cluster is to say we aim to deploy technologies that
will meet world needs for CHEAP AND CLEAN ENERGY.
Note that meeting the world's energy needs is not
exactly the same as solving GLOBAL WARMING. There
are other reasons, like prosperity and security, to
want cheap and clean energy. And there are other
causes of Global Warming, like plentiful unreflected
sunlight.</P>

<P>Rest assured, Massachusetts enertech will help reduce
Global Warming by cleaning up and eventually replacing
fossil fuels. What the world needs is not just CHEAP
energy, and not just CLEAN energy, but cheap AND clean
energy. The market opportunities and other motivations
are huge. (. . .)</P>

<A NAME="the_internet_can_help_solve_global_warming_and_energy"> </A>
<H2>THE INTERNET CAN HELP SOLVE GLOBAL WARMING AND ENERGY</H2>


<P>The Internet was invented in the 1960s. Last year,
a quarter billion new ports were shipped of my baby,
Ethernet, plumbing for the Internet. Today the
Internet has something like a billion users.</P>

<P>Here are three (3) ways in which the Internet can
help meet the world's needs for cheap and clean
energy and also solve Global Warming:</P>

<P>First, as it evolves to enhance its email, search,
blogs, social networking, audio, and video
capabilities, the Internet can increasingly be used
to reduce energy consumption by massively substituting
COMMUNICATION for TRANSPORTATION. Just think of all
the automobile and airplane miles and attendant
carbon emissions that will be saved by transmitting
our BITS to meetings instead of lugging our ATOMS.
Let's try hard to attend these Massachusetts Enertech
Cluster meetings in the future without actually going
anywhere. Down with pressing the flesh!</P>

<P>Second, starting with today's base of a billion users
and Google, the Internet is becoming an unprecedented
medium for COLLECTIVE INTELLIGENCE. More and more
people are getting better and better information
and communication tools that will be applied to the
development of cheap and clean energy and to solve
Global Warming. The Internet is helping accelerate
intellectual progress exponentially, and as Ray
Kurzweil writes, the singularity is near. <span class="bluetext">(((Yeah,
it ought to help Global Warming pronto when
we're all downloaded brains in a box.)))</span></P>

<P>And third, the people, processes, and institutions
that built the Internet will themselves help bring
the world cheap and clean energy. I'm talking here
about the Internet's teams of scientists, engineers,
entrepreneurs, and venture capitalists. And I'm
talking about actual Internet techies and FOCACA.
Of course, like the Internet, solving the world's
energy problems will take about 30 years. By
meeting here today, I hope we are aiming to help
techies deliver cheap and clean energy faster than
we delivered the Internet.</P>

<P>By the way, you might think I'd be sorry the Internet
Bubble burst, but I'm not. Al Gore and I may not have
invented the Internet, but we invented the Internet
Bubble. What we need now, and seem to be getting,
is an Enertech Bubble.</P>


<P>Sure technology bubbles eventually burst. So, to mix
metaphors, it's important to have a chair when the
music stops. But, mixing metaphors again, trying too
hard to avoid bubbles causes what control theorists
call over-damping. Over-damping the growth of our
Enertech Cluster would delay the arrival of the cheap
and clean energy that the world so badly needs.
Let our Enertech Bubble inflate!</P>

<A NAME="enertech_needs_a_newspaper,_not_the_boston_globe"> </A>
<H2>ENERTECH NEEDS A NEWSPAPER, NOT THE BOSTON GLOBE</H2>

<P>Silicon Valley has a "hometown newspaper" which plays
many roles in sustaining its various clusters. It's
the San Jose Mercury News. The Massachusetts Enertech
Cluster needs newspapers too. Sadly, the Boston Globe
edition of The New York Times will not do. The problem
is that The Globe is hostile to business and
incompetent to cover it. Instead, for essential help
in nurturing community in our Enertech Cluster, we
need to leverage the new online media, another thing
the Internet can do for energy and Global Warming.</P>

<P>I hasten to add about The Globe that, like almost
all other newspapers, its readership has been
declining for two decades. And, if you read it,
you should worry about all the trees they cut down
and all carbon they emit printing and distributing
that toxic stuff they call news.</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;IF IT'S A COLOR YOU NEED, AVOID GREEN&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;When you look at groups who call themselves GREEN,
you find a good many ulterior motives and a veritable
toxic waste dump of bad ideas. As pointed out by NYT
Columnist Tom Friedman at Pop!Tech in October, Greens
tend to be various combinations of environmentalist
(a good thing), but also anti-urban, anti-technology,
anti-nuke, anti-corporate, anti-globalization, and
anti-American. Our Enertech Cluster needs to be
careful about how we align with Greens.&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<A NAME="ulteriors_not_denied_and_decried_but_discovered"> </A>
<H2>ULTERIORS NOT DENIED AND DECRIED BUT DISCOVERED AND ALIGNED</H2>

<P>There are a good many of us involved in enertech who
have what might be called ulterior motives. I, for
example, am investing to get venture capital returns
for our limited partners. So it was with the Internet.
The trick is not to spend a lot of time denying and
decrying ulterior motives. The trick is to get
ulterior motives disclosed and aligned. We need to
harness everybody's motivations, not pretend they
don't exist or wish them away.</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;MY ENERTECH START-UPS: EMBER, SICORTEX, AND
GREENFUEL&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;Venture capitalists often brag about their
portfolio companies, and I'm no different, but I'll
try to keep it relevant to enertech, and short.&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;Calling Ember in South Boston an enertech start-up
is a REACH, but well worth it. Ember is a networking
company that delivers tiny radio semiconductors and
protocol software. Ember's aim is to network all the
world's embedded micro-controllers, of which,
according to IDC (another Massachusetts company)
there will be 10 billion new ones shipped next year.
Ember's go-to-market focus is home and building
control. And what do you think the principal benefits
of home and building control are? By wirelessly
controlling lights, heating, ventilation, and air
conditioning, many of Ember's early customers are
conserving energy. By wirelessly reading meters,
many of Ember's early customers better measure the
energy they are saving.&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;Calling SiCortex in Maynard an enertech start-up
is also a REACH, but worth it. SiCortex is a computer
systems company, so why is it an example of
Massachusetts enertech? First, SiCortex has just
launched open-source software Linux superclusters
that improve by factors of 10 delivered computational
performance per dollar, per foot, and, yes, per watt.
Because they each consume two factors of 10 fewer
watts than the PC microprocessors on our desks,
SiCortex fits six 64-bit microprocessors on a chip
and therefore 5,832 in a single cabinet, cooled by
air, saving energy on running the computers and even
more on cooling them. That's enertech. And second,
SiCortex is enertech because its superclusters are
designed for high-performance computing applications,
prominent among which are seismic data analysis for
oil exploration, climate modeling, fluid dynamics,
reactor simulations, quantum chromo dynamics &ndash;
enertech. No wonder the lead in SiCortex's recent
$21M venture financing was Chevron.&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;Calling GreenFuel in Cambridge an enertech start-up
is NOT a reach. GreenFuel is now working with huge
electric power plants in the Arizona desert to scale
up its enertech. GreenFuel pipes CO2-laden flue
gases through algae slurries circulating in solar
bioreactors. GreenFuel algae use photosynthesis in
enertech greenhouses to remove greenhouse gases
(CO2 and NOx) from the flue gases before release
into the atmosphere.&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt; And then, get this, the rapidly thickening algal
slurry is harvested several times per day to produce
lipids, starches, and proteins for extraction into
substantial quantities of, respectively, biodiesel,
ethanol, and feed. GreenFuel algae-solar bioreactors
do require acreage, water, and electricity, but junk
land, dirty water, and single-digit percentages of
parasitic power. GreenFuel treats CO2 as a valuable
plant food and, rather than try to sequester it
expensively, GreenFuel recycles CO2, cleaning the
atmosphere while producing cheap and clean energy.
That's enertech.&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>It's hard sometimes, but it's important to keep
in mind that clustering is not a zero-sum game.
I am not enthusiastic about promoting the Massachusetts
Enertech Cluster so as to beat California &ndash; I lived
in California for 22 years and still sometimes think
of it as home. Nor would I want Maine, where I have
also lived and still summer, to think I have switched
allegiance to Massachusetts. Nor would I want MIT to
suspect that I am working to give Waltham or Boston a
leg up on Cambridge. Or that I favor 02139 over 02138.</P>

<P>Again, clustering is not a zero-sum game. The world
is waiting for us to provide cheap and clean energy.
Let's cluster!</P>

<A NAME="the_panels_to_follow"> </A>
<H2>THE PANELS TO FOLLOW</H2>

<P>Shortly, we will attend panels on energy conservation,
on alternative technologies, and on growing our energy
(or enertech) cluster. The panelists are first rate,
and I look forward to hearing from them. Fostering
communication like this is key to growing our
enertech cluster.</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt; Let's not make our energy cluster be about
government policies that anoint people, technologies,
companies, or regions of the country, but about
sustaining environments in which competition can
run free.&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<A NAME="hard_not_to_call_these_enertech_gatherings__metcalfe_"> </A>
<H2>HARD NOT TO CALL THESE ENERTECH GATHERINGS "METCALFE"</H2>

<P>The Massachusetts Technology Leadership Council
(MTLC) sustains our software cluster. We have a
telecommunications council. We have a biotech council.
We have a nanotech council. We have a New England
Venture Capital Association. We have a Massachusetts
Information Technology Exchange.</P>

<P>The Massachusetts energy technology cluster needs
councils too. And near the top of its priorities,
this council should serve as a liaison for
entrepreneurs.</P>

<P>Today could be the inaugural meeting of one of our
new enertech cluster councils, which we have to call
something like the "Massachusetts Energy Technology
Council And Liaison For Entrepreneurs," or for short,
METCALFE. Just kidding.</P>

<P>OK, may we should call it the "Boston Energy Advanced
Technology Council And Liaison," for short, BEATCAL.
Just kidding.</P>

<P>Or broadening the geographical focus a bit, there
is the New England Energy Innovation Collaborative
&ndash; NEEIC (pronounced "neek") — which Polaris is
planning to join. See <A HREF="http://www.neeic.org/">www.neeic.org</A>.</P>

<P>Thank you.</P>

<H2>END OF ACTUAL SPEECH</H2>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Further choice impolitic remarks by Bob Metcalfe.)))</span></P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;WE ARE RICH BECAUSE WE HAVE ENERGY, NOT VICE
VERSA&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;There are amazing satellite images floating
around various conferences that show Earth at night.
What's funny is how these images are used for such
different purposes.&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;Sometimes the speaker showing an Earth-at-night
image will complain about how much energy we waste
lighting the night sky. During a speech last month
in Washington, Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld
showed North and South Korea from space at night,
noting how the Communist ideology of the North has
left them starving in the dark. And there was the
image at Pop!Tech (<A HREF="http://www.poptech.org/">www.poptech.org</A>) in October
showing Africa, the Dark Continent, with hardly any
lights at all. The Pop!Tech speaker was not bragging
about how "green" Africans are, but about how poor
and dying they are.&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;Energy is a factor of production. It's NOT so much
that the USA wastes energy because it can afford to.
Fact is, it's easier to grow economies and proliferate
prosperity when you have abundant energy. You often
hear how America's energy use per capita is high.
You hear less often is that America's energy
consumption is about proportional to our economic
output. It is a dead-end to ask nations to give up
their prosperity, or hopes of prosperity, in order
to use less energy to solve Global Warming.</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;Al Gore says that George Bush is thwarting adoption
of the Kyoto Treaty. Gore does not mention that when
the Kyoto Treaty was brought to the Senate of the USA,
where treaties are supposed to be ratified, Kyoto was
voted down, and not just by Republicans. It was voted
down 95-0. That was 1997, during the Clinton-Gore
administration, when Gore was himself President of
the Senate.&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;The Global Warming problem is not that the
prosperous United States wastes too much energy.
The problem is that the developing world wants to be
prosperous too. That's why developing nations have
to be exempted from Kyoto, as if their ramping
carbon dioxide emissions won't count. Telling them
to conserve energy won't work either. Cheap and clean
energy is needed to grow the world's economies (and
solve Global Warming).&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;GREENS SHOULD RECONSIDER&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;Beliefs that Greens really ought reconsider are
anti-nuke, anti-urban, and anti-technology.&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;Nuclear power plants, about 100 of which are
already providing 20% of our electricity, do so
cheaply and cleanly. However, because of anti-nuke
Greens, there has not been a new nuclear plant built
in the USA in 25 years. If you want to make policies
to promote cheap and clean energy, get rid of Green
policies that keep nuclear permitting an uncertain
and expensive process lasting decades.&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;Greens also have for decades promoted their belief
in rural living. Now it's emerging that your
"environmental footprint" is actually lower when you
live in a city. Fortunately, humans, despite all
those Greens getting back to the Earth, are now
moving to cities by the hundreds of millions.&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;Greens also promote small-scale organic farming,
which they contrast with high-tech farming by
corporations. It's turning out that low-productivity
farming takes more cleared land and is bad for our
environment.&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;If our Enertech Cluster needs a color, I suggest
not green but white, or albedo, as climate scientists
sometimes call it, from the Latin for white. Cheap and
clean energy will not alone solve Global Warming.
The problem is that light from the Sun carries a lot
of energy to Earth, and there is evidence that too
little of it is being reflected back out into space.
Earth's albedo is the ratio of reflected to incident
light. Green has a low albedo; white the highest.&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;ENHANCING THE PARASOL EFFECT&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;One of my private investigations is finding ways
to enhance the so-called Parasol Effect. The odd
thing is that sulfur pollution in the upper atmosphere,
which we are carefully working to reduce, now
enhances the Parasol Effect to offset about a third
of the Greenhouse Effect. Large volcanoes cause
Earth's temperature to plunge when they enhance the
Parasol Effect by belching reflective particles into
the atmosphere. We should be looking harder at how
to send benign reflecting particles into the
stratosphere in order to enhance the Parasol Effect
on purpose, to keep the temperature of Earth wherever
we want it, which seems to be the same as it is now
(or maybe a little bit cooler).&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;What I have noticed is that we are no longer
content to endure the weather. We have learned enough
about Earth that we are beginning to be able to
predict the weather. Now that we are noticing that
we are able to change the weather, albeit
inadvertently, we will soon demand to CONTROL the
weather. We will need Parasol Effect nanomaterial
and its antidote to control the weather &ndash; to keep
the weather exactly where we want it even against
climate changes caused by non-human activities,
like the orbit of Earth, volcanoes, Sun spots, etc.&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;When we know enough about Earth to control the
temperature, then we will have a new political
problem. We will need to ask somebody, perhaps the
United Nations, if we want Earth to be warmer,
cooler, or just the same. That will be interesting.&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;After that, from a future generation of techies,
we will expect to control temperatures differently
at different places and times across Earth's surface.
And why not? We already have zoned thermostats in
many buildings.&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>

<P>&lt;&lt;&lt;Thank you.&gt;&gt;&gt;</P>
