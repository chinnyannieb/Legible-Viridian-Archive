<P><span class="bluetext">(((If you read Viridian List, you want this new book.
The proper time for you to buy it is now.  Why?
Because the modern publishing system, such as it
is, has become as deranged and sclerotic as the
movie business, so a big early roll-out counts
for a lot in their ridiculous biz calculations.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((There are two thousand of you out there, and
what we Viridians lack in raw numbers we make up
for in culture-hacking perspicacity.  So I want you
to buy three of them.  Buy one for yourself,
buy two more as propaganda, I mean "gifts," and
give them to someone older than yourself and
younger than yourself, so as to induce a nice
demographic spread across the reader-buyer
user-base.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((If this tome becomes as big a hit as its
spiritual ancestor the WHOLE EARTH CATALOG,
we can accelerate the change to a high-tech
green 21C by years.  Furthermore, even though
it's reasonably priced, it comes in a gorgeously
designed Stefan Sagmeister slipcase that looks
really classy, so your gift recipients will not
feel politically and culturally manipulated but
will be all impressed by your good taste.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((They're going to read this thing, and they're
going to have stretch-marks all over their heads,
because in their morose sorrow during years of
domination by fundie creeps, they've forgotten what
new ideas look like and this book is full of them.
You won't have to lift a finger to affect this
change within them -- for these are the heavy guns
of the movement here, assembled in battalion.
I've been showing my copy to scientists, engineering
professors, government workers -- serious, seasoned
people, reality-based-community people.  They are
awestruck.  And justly so.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((As it so happens, I wrote an introduction to
this book. Then Al Gore muscled in and wrote
a second introduction.  That's how good this
book is.  It's heavy-duty.  It's so heavy that guys
who should have been President of the United
States are all concerned.  If you are into cybergreen
issues you can't call yourself informed without
WORLDCHANGING.  Furthermore, the people
involved in this effort are the absolute salt of the earth.
They're bright, fluent, capable and they genuinely
get it.  They don't merely "get it," they are
inventing that which it is necessary to get.
These are people you need to know a lot more about.)))</span></P>


<P><span class="bluetext">(((After buying some books, for the system requires
financial stimulation, go talk about it.  Talk
it up, talk about it incessantly.  Word-of-mouth
the living daylights out of it.  Normally this is
annoying behavior, in the case of this book we can
make a moral exception.  This book demands discussion
because it's full of amazing and completely
apt material which can't be found anywhere else.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Further note that there is an associated book tour.
If your town is being graced with WORLDCHANGING
authors you should get up, leave the screen, go there,
press the flesh, vow some Bright Green fealty and buy
more of the book, so that the tour is extended.  Yes,
I am completely in earnest about you doing this.
That's practical, it's doable and it can make a
serious difference. But, you know, not five months
from now.  The iron is red-hot right now.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((You may have been reading Viridian Notes for
eight years.  Lord knows I have.  Imagine those hours
of labor and, uh, occasional amusement.  Well, the
release of this book is a crux event.  If this book is
a hit, the world will actually change.  And in a
direction of which we strongly approve.  If that
happens, you're going to see sprightly, forward-
marching Viridian Notes full of cheery news about
cool Bright Green developments hitting mainstream
acceptance, like, for instance, the Googletorium
bedizened with a zillion solar panels.  Who can't
like that?)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Otherwise, you'll be locked in the souring
terror-bunker  watching black water pour in over
the sill as a society poisoned by Lysenkoist denial
drowns in its own spew.  Okay, frankly, you're just
bound to get some black darkside spew from Viridian
List, no matter how grand things are going, but let's
face it: this is a unique opportunity for you to take
a direct and personal action that briskly heaves
that slider-bar into the direction of light and reason.
So do it.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((If you are one of our non-Anglophone readers,
go pester somebody to translate it.)))</span></P>

<P>Our Toronto stop is shaping up to be one of the
biggest of the entire tour. It's been really amazing
to see the way all our Canadian colleagues have come
together to create what looks to be an absolutely
phenomenal evening of big ideas, worldchanging
innovation, and community celebration.
Ed Burtynsky, the noted photographer (and WC board
member) and Ron Dembo (of Zerofootprint) will be
joining Alex on stage to present an evening of
Worldchanging ideas on November 14. Folks from the
Art Gallery of Ontario will be creating an
installation. Various DJs will lay down some
sounds while we meet and mingle and party until late.
This promises to be one of the most exciting events
of the year. We hope you'll plan to attend.
