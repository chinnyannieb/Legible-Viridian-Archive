<DL><dt>Key concepts:</dt> <dd>2012, futurism, John L. Peterson,
Arlington Institute, prognostications</dd>

<dt>Attention Conservation Notice:</dt>  <dd>Happy new years...
these meditations by Washington-based pundit
John Peterson seem to reflect the current mood of the
times in the Beltway, which are about as dazed and
miserablist-apocalyptophile as one can imagine.
Looks like the world will be hit on the head
with a series of hammers until morale improves.
I'm having a lot of black-humored fun at this
guy's expense here, but I think he's dealing
with the season as best he can.

"Regional Nuclear War Could Spark Climate Change."  It's our
dear old friend, "nuclear winter," now
creatable by most anybody.  Imagine global warming
AND a nuclear winter.   "We are at a perilous
crossroads," said Owen Toon of the University of
Colorado at Boulder's Department of Atmospheric and
Oceanic Sciences. "The current combination of nuclear
proliferation, political instability and urban
demographics form perhaps the greatest danger to
the stability of society since the dawn of humanity."

<P>John Peterson writes:<BR>
"This time of the year always generates an unusual
amount of deep thinking. People try to stop for a
moment and consider what has happened over the last
year and attempt to get a handle on the more profound
implications of what this thing called life is all
about and where we are all going.
"And then, here's one from me. It's a chapter for
a book which will be published next year."</P>

<P>Getting to 2012: Big Changes Ahead
John L. Petersen</P>

<P>Consider this recent BBC headline:
"Current global consumption levels could result in
a large-scale ecosystem collapse by the middle of
the century, environmental group WWF has warned."
One that followed was: "Climate change threatens
supplies of water for millions of people in poorer
countries, warns a new report from the Christian
development agency Tearfund"  <span class="bluetext">(((Great name for
a Christian development agency.)))</span></P>

<P>About the same time the Washington Post said:
"Birds, bees, bats and other species that pollinate
North American plant life are losing population,
according to a study released yesterday by the
National Research Council."</P>

<P>Reuters added: "Failing to fight global warming now
will cost trillions of dollars by the end of the
century even without counting biodiversity loss
or unpredictable events like the Gulf Stream
shutting down."</P>

<P>Author James Howard Kunstler chimed in: "The Long
Emergency is going to be a tremendous trauma for
the human race. We will not believe that this is
happening to us, that 200 years of modernity can
be brought to its knees by a world-wide power shortage.
The survivors will have to cultivate a religion of
hope -- that is, a deep and comprehensive belief
that humanity is worth carrying on.”  <span class="bluetext">(((You gotta
love J. Kunstler.  A situation that dire creates "a
religion of hope?"  The top religious activists in
the world already cultivate a religion of holy suicide
and blow up their own mosques! Imagine the jolly,
affirmative, carry-on mood those jihadis would be
in during a Regional Nuclear Winter.)))</span></P>

<P>"Then, in a landmark report compiled by Sir Nicholas
Stern for the UK government, comes the admonition:
The world has to act now on climate change or face
devastating economic consequences. Sir Nicholas
estimated that at most humanity has ten years before
the shift is unrecoverable.  <span class="bluetext">(((What if it's already
ten years too late?  Or twenty years?  Shouldn't we
be giving this prospect a lot more serious thought?
We're not averting anything much; there are daisies
blooming in Moscow.)))</span></P>

<P>What's going on here? What does this all mean?
<span class="bluetext">(((Settle in, folks; he's about to let fly.)))</span></P>

<P>These are extraordinary statements about massive
earth changes. Are they just random trends that
happen to be coincidentally showing up at the same
time, or perhaps they reflect some big, historic,
underlying dynamic == maybe the world is about to
experience a shift unlike anything ever seen before.
<span class="bluetext">(((You know what's worse than a futurist who over-
promises?  A futurist who over-delivers.)))</span>
There are reasons to believe the latter could be
the case. Many sources, both conventional and
unconventional, suggest that we are living in a
special time == that between now and 2012 the world
will undergo an epochal shift to a new era.</P>

<P>This rapid evolution will produce a world that
operates in fundamentally different ways than it
has in the past.<span class="bluetext">(((For instance, it might well
operate the way a 500-pound gorilla operates when
it (a) has Ebola (b) is on fire and  (c ) has
recently converted to Islam.)))</span></P>

<P>The indicators are there. Take a closer look at
what is already happening.</P>

<P>Demographics:</P>

<P>Nearly a half of all people on the planet are under
the age of 25[i]. That's the largest youth generation
in history. The overwhelming majority of these young
people live in the developing world and almost a
quarter are surviving on less than $1 a day[ii]
Most of them know about the quality of life in the
West. Many have seen and used a computer or a
mobile phone.  <span class="bluetext">(((Bring it on, kids! Got all the
pirate MP3s and YouTube you can eat!)))</span></P>

<P>Peaking of the Global Oil Supply:</P>

<P>Regardless of the increased awareness that our oil
resources are finite, demand for oil is growing.
In the last years it grew from 79.8 (2003) to 84.3
(2005) million bpd[iii]. Even if the Chinese economy
were to slow down, the growth is still likely to
continue with a pressure from India.</P>

<P>Supply, on the other hand, appears to have peaked.
We now have nine and a half months of "rearview
mirror" action to look back and see that world oil
production has retreated from its all-time high of
just over 85 million barrels a day (m/b/d) achieved
in December 2005 (just as geologist Kenneth Deffeyes
of Princeton had predicted). For 2006, production
has remained in the 84 m/b/d range every month
reported so far, while demand has exceeded that.[iv]</P>

<P>Oil curse is a term coined to reflect the desperate
situation of many oil rich but otherwise
underdeveloped countries. The Chinese are now
involved in a comprehensive international outreach
to African countries, buying up resources (not just
oil) in Nigeria, Angola, Congo, Sudan. So far oil
importers used mostly economic and political means
to compete for oil but will inevitably resort to
military strategies as soon as they realize that
they have probably passed peak oil threshold.
<span class="bluetext">((("Inevitably?" It's a done deal; the Iraq War's
been going on for years now and producing LESS oil,
not more.)))</span></P>

<P>The report "Peaking of World Oil Production:
Impacts, Mitigation and Risk Management” prepared
by SAIC for the Department of Energy concludes that
humanity is facing asymmetric risks associated with
the peaking of oil. Although mitigation actions
initiated prematurely may result in a poor use of
resources, late initiation of mitigation may result
in severe consequences. Early mitigation measures
are necessary to install production capacities for
alternative energy in time for the peaking of oil.
<span class="bluetext">(((Why do weird spook-boffin outfits like SAIC use such
bland and anonymous bureaucrat-speak?)))</span></P>

<P>Species Extinction</P>

<P>Despite an avowed reverence for life, human beings
continue to destroy other species at an alarming rate,
rivaling the great extinctions of the geologic past.
In the process, we are foreclosing the possibility
of discovering the secrets they contain for the
development of new life-saving medicines and of
invaluable models for medical research, and we are
beginning to disrupt the vital functioning of
ecosystems on which all life depends. We may also
be losing some species so uniquely sensitive to
environmental degradation that they may serve as
our "canaries," warning us of future threats to
human health.[v]  <span class="bluetext">(((Not to mention that they
make all the oxygen.)))</span></P>

<P>The speed of species extinction has forced
scientists to refer to the current era as the
sixth extinction event comparable to only five
other events in the known history of biosphere
(that's a few billion of years!)
<span class="bluetext">(((Yeah, and imagine how the scientists will direly
refer to these things when the scientists themselves
are extinct.)))</span></P>

<P>A good example is a new study that shows that the
oceans' fish are being depleted so fast that
eating seafood might be just a memory in 40 years.
The researchers say more is at stake than our diet,
for they find the dwindling of fish stocks hurts
the world economically and the ocean environmentally.
Researchers say it is not too late to reverse the
trend.[vi]  <span class="bluetext">(((What if it WAS too late? "Welp,
the ocean's turned to carbonic seltzer-water and
all the fish just died."  I wonder who would be
hired to spin that.)))</span></P>

<P>According to Millennium Ecosystem Assessment,
the challenge of reversing the degradation of
ecosystems while meeting increasing demands for
their services could be partially met under some
scenarios that they have considered but these
involve significant changes in policies,
institutions and practices, that are not
currently under way.  <span class="bluetext">(((Unless you count
nuclear proliferation, which could create some
big flaming changes in institutions and practices
as quick as you can say "Jack Robinson.")))</span></P>

<P>Climate Change: <span class="bluetext">(((Let's settle on down and throw
another shrimp on the barbie... wait, the
shrimp all died and Australia's consumed
with brushfires.)))</span>)</P>

<P>Earth is already as warm as at any time in the
last 10,000 years, and is within 1&deg;C of being
its hottest for a million years. Another decade
of business-as-usual carbon emissions will probably
make it too late to prevent the ecosystems of the
north from triggering runaway climate change[vii].
<span class="bluetext">(((Well, there you have it, ladies and gentlemen;
an outright futurist prophecy of doom.)))</span></P>

<P>Feedback loops (the self-reinforcing relationships
between the change in CO2, global warming and
other factors) are driving the dynamics of climate
change. In fact, they are the source of exponential
rates of growth. We may be entering a phase in
which global warming becomes a runaway train.
<span class="bluetext">(((Good thing the train ran out of oil, then.)))</span></P>

<P>Glaciers in the Himalayas are receding faster than
in any other part of the world and if the present
rate of retreat continues, they may be gone by 2035.
More than 2 billion people == a third of the world's
population, rely on the Himalayas for their water[viii]
<span class="bluetext">(((Definitely dents our prospects for Szechuan
chow and Bollywood movies.)))</span></P>

<P>An increase in global temperatures can interfere
with the workings of the ocean conveyor belt and
bring another ice age to Europe. The earth's
ocean system is characterized by thermal inertia.
This means that it adapts slowly to global cooling
and warming but once it starts to warm up or cool
down, the process will extend for a long period of
time. For us, it means that even if all human
emissions were to stop now, thermal inertia of
the ocean could sustain an increase in global
temperatures.</P>

<P>According to conclusions of Intergovernmental Panel
on Climate Change of the World Meteorological
Organization (WMO) <span class="bluetext">(((These IPCC guys need a much
snappier name == I suggest "Giant Planetary Flaming
Doom Patrol")))</span> and the United Nations Environment
Programme (UNEP), there is new and stronger evidence
that most of the warming observed over the last 50
years is attributable to human activities.</P>

<P>Major Economic Disruption  <span class="bluetext">(((Show me the money!)))</span></P>

<P>During 2003-4, in a concern about possible "deflation",
the Federal Reserve ran the interest rates that they
charged banks down so low (1%), that mortgage lenders
began offering below-prime mortgages with little or
no money down. Refinancing of existing mortgages
was at an all-time high. Huge increases in mortgages
resulted (more than five times the amount between
2002 and 2006 than in the preceding five-year period).</P>

<P>Many if not most of those loans (whose real interest
rate was higher than "prime" mortgages secured in
historical ways) had extra-low payments in the
loan's early years with a substantial increase in
payments after the "balloon" period. People were
buying homes whose income would never have allowed
them to own a home previous to that time . . . and
those least able to pay their loans began using
credit card credit to make up for the shortfall in
income.</P>

<P>In 2005 for the first time since 1933, the savings
rate in America became negative.<span class="bluetext">(((Could this possibly
make any difference at all if the Chinese and the
Indians have no water to drink and America's
pollination species have died off?  This is like
a banker in a collapsing World Trade Center tower
trying to re-schedule lunch with his broker.)))</span></P>

<P>This happened about the same time that personal
credit card debt reached its highest level ever
(number of U.S. credit cards grew 75% from 1990
to 2003 while the amount that was charged increased
350%). Consumer credit as a percentage of personal
income has never been so high (30 % increase since
2000 alone) and household debt as a percentage of
house assets is at a record. <span class="bluetext">(((So what?  They're
supposed to scrimp and save so their kids can
enjoy the Sixth Great Extinction?  Obviously
the only course for a rational economic actor
under these conditions is to eat drink &amp; be
merry.  Max out the plastic!  Hey, it works
for the government.)))</span></P>

<P>Independent analysis shows that credit card
defaults begin about 24 months after a borrower
has fundamentally overextended him or herself and
therefore history suggests that we should see a
dramatic increase in mortgage defaults starting
in 2006. In fact, the percentage of U.S. subprime
loans that were made in 2006 and delinquent in
payments by 60 or more days by August of the year
rose 100% over similar loans made in 2005.[ix]
<span class="bluetext">(((Okay, I'm getting a little confused here...
we get a Great Depression <STRONG>first,</STRONG> then the
oil peak, the oil warand the self-reinforcing
climate juggernaut that freezes Europe and also
parches the Himalayas?  Can we have one from
Column A and two from Column B?)))</span></P>

<P>All banks have a great percentage of their
assets tied up in mortgage-based securities.
If the default rate on mortgages increases
significantly it could well translate into a
major threat to the solvency of many banks.
<span class="bluetext">(((Why would we even NEED banks?  I don't
remember many ATMs on the set of "Mad Max
Beyond Thunderdome.)))</span></P>

<P>The debt situation will be exacerbated by the
retirement of the baby boomers <span class="bluetext">(((The "flood of
gray hippies threat," oh Lordy)))</span> and implementation
of the new banking regulations under the auspices
of the Basel II Accords that demand the revamping
of the global banking system, for which no banks
are likely to be ready.  <span class="bluetext">(((If nobody's bothering
with Kyoto or the Geneva Convention, why would
they care about the "Basel II Accords"?)))</span></P>

<P>According to Warren Buffet, the current financial
system is highly unstable. Highly complex financial
instruments == derivatives == are time bombs and
"financial weapons of mass destruction". "Derivatives
generate reported earnings that are often wildly
overstated and based on estimates whose inaccuracy
may not be exposed for many years".  <span class="bluetext">(((Or, in
fact, ever.  You think we'd be worried about Enron's
books if Katrina had wiped out Houston?)))</span></P>

<P>"Large amounts  of risk have become concentrated
in the hands of relatively few derivatives dealers
. . . which can trigger serious systemic problems"
Derivatives can push companies onto a "spiral that
can lead to a corporate meltdown".  <span class="bluetext">(((Given that
2 percent of the planet owns fifty percent of
everything, why don't they just buy themselves some
fresh governments and re-invent all the paper?)))</span></P>

<P>Investor George Soros pronounced the same criticisms
regarding the global financial system. He believes
that unless fundamental reforms are implemented,
the current system will continue on a spiral of
crises[x].</P>

<P>Watershed Time?</P>

<P>Is the nexus of these forces a unique watershed time
that will usher in a new era on this planet? Will
the structures and institutions that we are all
familiar with and depend upon struggle and even
fail in the near future under the stress produced
by breakdowns in multiple sectors?  <span class="bluetext">(((Those words
sound so amazingly dull compared to what that
would "breakdowns in multiple sectors" would
actually feel like.  Oh well, at least, unlike
most Oil Peakists, he's not rubbing his hands
in glee about it.)))</span></P>

<P>Add to the litany above <span class="bluetext">(((oh goody)))</span> increasingly
sophisticated terrorism, serious global shortages
of drinking water, growing population pressures,
and the possibility of other shocks like a global
pandemic <span class="bluetext">(((bird flu, you return at last, we
scarcely knew ye)))</span> and you've got the line up for
the potential for a major directional shift.
The convergence of climate, oil and financial trends
alone could produce a "perfect storm" that reorders
the future of humanity on this planet.
<span class="bluetext">(((Really, pretty much any one of those factors would
pop the World As We Know It like a boot on a
Christmas ornament... "re-ordering?" Is that
quite the proper word?)))</span></P>

<P>A New Paradigm</P>

<P>If failure of the present system is what we're
looking at, it would certainly be followed by a new
paradigm. If the old system came down, a new one
would evolve that attempted to bypass the systemic
frailties of the previous world. <span class="bluetext">(((Kind of like
Soviet Communism being replaced by a sunny new realm of
Mafia Petrocracy.)))</span> It would necessarily be a
fundamentally different way of understanding reality,
attended by new perspectives of science, ecology,
economy, cosmology, governing, agriculture, and
education, among the other basic intellectual
structures which support human activity.
<span class="bluetext">(((You know, that sounds pretty radical, but I'm
so fed up by this time that I think I might be
willing to go for that.  Sure, man, junk the works!
The rotten Roman Empire has gotta go!  Just as long
as I don't get vandalized,  become feudal slave
labor or undergo a religious conversion.)))</span></P>


<P>The new world, as in all paradigm shifts, would
not make much sense from our present
perspective. Never having seen group larger than
a clan, a hunter-gatherer contemplating the
future would have been hard-pressed to envision
a world that included people living in towns and
villages. Similarly, the future that may arrive
with 2012 would necessarily seem strange in the
context of most of our upbringing.<span class="bluetext">(((That's five
years away, folks.  I hope they're still reading
sci-fi novels in Wonderland.)))</span></P>

<P>But as we get closer to the time of this epic shift
the early outlines of a new future appear to be
emerging. First of all, the new world is a highly
interdependent and connected one. The complexity
of our present communications systems link individual
humans in ways that would have seemed impossible just
two decades ago (the World Wide Web had not yet been
invented only fifteen years ago!) As the ability
to interact in increasingly more sophisticated ways
develops, a point will be passed when humanity begins
to act like an organism, rather than unrelated
individuals and small groups. <span class="bluetext">(((What KIND of
"organism"?  Hope it has a backbone.)))</span></P>

<P>Ideas will transit the world like rumors in a small
town. Concepts and perspectives will infect the
global brain and produce behavior never before seen.
We will see our future tied to others many thousands
of miles away from us in ways that would have made
no sense five years ago. We will rapidly become
planetary citizens.  <span class="bluetext">(((Hey, it's working for me
here in Serbia.)))</span></P>

<P>Similarly, ecological interconnectedness is also
rapidly becoming obvious. For many of us, we now
know that we are all related to the larger
environmental system in which we live in ways that
we never previously understood. The death of a
third of the coral reefs in the world and ten-thousand
other species a year will surely affect the
system that supports human life . . . and certainly
not beneficially.<span class="bluetext">(((Yeah, and while you can
always start a new bank, good luck re-inventing
the coral reef.)))</span></P>

<P>All of this new knowledge will of necessity change
our behavior in the future. We will see ourselves
as an integral part of the whole system in which we
live. We will know that we are all in the same
life boat and each of our futures is a function of
the future of all of us. Self-interest and security,
whether characterized in personal or national terms,
will very quickly encompass far more space and
people than it has in the past.</P>

<P>In the face of rapid  climate change, for example,
national security would  approach becoming synonymous
with global security. <span class="bluetext">((("Khaki Green."  I'd be
happier about this prospect if I'd seen any national
army win a war lately.)))</span></P>

<P>We'll also see ourselves connected in spiritual terms.
Perhaps this is where the real paradigm shift will
take place.<span class="bluetext">(((No it isn't.  At least, I sure
hope not.)))</span></P>


<P>More and more individuals are beginning to experience
and internalize the fact that we are connected to
each other and with animals, plants and even the
earth in ways that even though inexplicable are
nevertheless demonstrable. Serious new scientifically
based books are now being written about how human
behavior is connected to the larger cosmos and how
that throughout history it has predictably reflected
in how we behave. Agricultural systems are in place
that claim to tap into elemental spiritual forces in
order to grow crops better. Many studies now show
that the intentionality of prayer significantly
affects single-cellular life as well as humans . . .
and it doesn't make any difference whether either
party knows the other one (or that they're praying)
or not.<span class="bluetext">(((It's kind of pitiful to see the guy
reduced to this kind of knee-wobbling guff.
It's like the last reel of Dickens' A CHRISTMAS
CAROL, the one with my personal favorite, the
utterly terrifying Ghost of Christmas Future.
He must be really, seriously scared to offer
prayer to bacteria as the sign of way forward.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Here are some interesting bacteria that
probably aren't much affected by prayer because
they apparently CAME FROM MARS.  "What, you're
kidding, right?" Uh... maybe.)))</span>
Link:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.astrobiology.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=22750">http://www.astrobiology.com/news/viewsr.html?pid=22750</A></P>

<P>"There is evidence now that somehow humans anticipate
big disruptions to the system (like 9/11 and the
Indonesian tsunami) and begin to have extraordinary
precognitive dreams before these major events.
<span class="bluetext">(((If that's somehow so, I really, really hope
that I'm spared those.  Imagine DREAMING about
total ecological collapse before it happened.
It'd be like something out of Stephen King.)))</span></P>

<P>This spiritual awareness seems on a trajectory
that will expand to include the ability to tap into
the global collective unconscious and may even become
somewhat predictive == marrying advanced knowledge
technology with dreaming and other intuitive
processes.<span class="bluetext">(((If you can't think of a way out
of this mess, maybe you'd better sleep on it.)))</span></P>

<P>Growing numbers of thoughtful people are coming to
the conclusion that intentionality directly shapes
reality. How our thoughts translate into the
reconfiguration of matter and different behavior
in others is not clear, but for many, life-long
experiences tell them that that is how it works.</P>

<P>In all of this there appears to be an alternative
dimension(s) for communication that facilitates
this interconnectivity. Who knows, perhaps human
telepathy may be emergent as we see ourselves more
tightly committed to each other in the future.
<span class="bluetext">(((I'd be tempted to read the mind of a climate
skeptic and see if there's anything actually in
there.)))</span></P>

<P>In any case, there are a great number of indicators,
both historical and contemporary, that suggest that
we are approaching a time of extraordinary change.
Although no one now alive has ever lived through a
similar shift, the history of the planet, as we
know it, suggests that these kinds of major upheavals
have happened many times in the past == in fact,
they are the fundamental evolutionary mechanism for
the planet. Biological life moved abruptly from
single-cellular life to multiple-cellular life after
a very long period of equilibrium. Then multiple-
cellular life was punctuated by a radical
transformation that yielded vertebrates . . .
which were followed by rapid shifts to mammals,
early humans, and then homo sapiens.<span class="bluetext">(((Which then
briskly killed themselves off and left the world
to its next possessors, the telepathic Martian
microbes.  Hey, it could happen!)))</span></P>

<P>Social evolutionary punctuations continued moving
hunter-gathers into villages and towns, finally
resulting in the printing press which enabled the
industrial age. Perhaps the Internet represents
the new communications infrastructure upon which
the radically new paradigm will be built.<span class="bluetext">(((Or,
if there's no fuel whatsoever and complete economic
collapse, a printing press in a village would
be lookin' pretty good.)))</span></P>

<P>Perhaps we are about to experience another
punctuation in the equilibrium of human evolution.
Patterns from the past suggest that the time is
right for another one. The question is, are we ready?
<span class="bluetext">(((For THAT!? By 2012? Gimme a break!)))</span></P>

<P>If the change that seems to be forming on the
horizon is anything like it appears it might be,
then all humans will need to move into a new mode
of living and thinking in order to survive the
transition.<span class="bluetext">(((Aw come on, we can't ALL survive...
is it too much to ask that the living won't
envy the dead in five years? I like to think that
my demands on futurity are pretty modest, but,
well. . . .)))</span></P>

<P>There will need to be a constant orientation of
openness == having a wide aperture for sensing subtle
indicators that point toward coming change and
being receptive to newly emerging approaches to
dealing with the rapidly changing environment.
If one is not open to the suggestions and ideas
of others, they will necessarily falter, as no
one individual will have the capability to deal
with this change by themselves. New ideas and
explanations about how reality works will begin
to bubble-up in many places; they must be openly
considered and honestly evaluated. <span class="bluetext">(((And,
if the ideas turn out to be moronic, the guys
who hold them need to be kicked out of power.)))</span></P>

<P>There must also be an openness to adapt == to
rapidly change when it is required.
The survivors of this epochal shift will necessarily
live closer to the earth. They will know that
their food does not come from the supermarket . . .
in fact, they may well know the farmer who grows it.
They will be sensitive to the earth in ways that
they perhaps previously reserved only for humans.
The current movement toward "relocalization" ==
shifting one's life and relationships closer to
a sustaining support system == will probably be
rather mature.<span class="bluetext">(((Well, none of that is sending
my morale soaring, just yet... You know what would
be really great right now?  A twelve-year-old
single-malt Scotch and a big chocolate ice-cream
sundae.)))</span></P>

<P>Effectively transitioning to this new world will
require envisioning it into reality. We will all
need to develop a basic, but coherent idea of what
the new world might look like == the principles,
values, structures, behavior, etc. == and begin
to carry that common picture in our minds.
<span class="bluetext">(((Kinda like the concepts of cyberpunk in the
early 1980s == "Hey wow, someday there will be
a world rather like the late 1990s.")))</span></P>

<P>We need to "get together" at regular times with
as many others as possible to project the new
images into the space from which everything comes.
<span class="bluetext">(((I hope there's catering.)))</span></P>

<P>We should do it as though our life depends on it,
as it probably does.  <span class="bluetext">(((Well, that's a nicer
sentiment than packing up some survivalist ammo
and heading for the hills.)))</span></P>

<P>We are all blessed to live at this time of
extraordinary transformation. Each in his or her
own way has a special role to play in contributing
to the ultimate shape and function of this new
world. That's probably why we are here at this time.
We should not hesitate to vigorously play our part.
Time is short.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Well, it may be that we're damned to live in
this time of sinister and extraordinary collapse.
But even if so, he's right: we need to vigorously
play.  Just look tomorrow right in the eye and go for
it.  The silliest suggestion in here is a thousand
times better than sticking your fingers in your
ears.  We're gonna catch-it big time, so we
might as well put our hands out.)))</span></P>
