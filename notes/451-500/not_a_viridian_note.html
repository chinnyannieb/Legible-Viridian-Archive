<P>SHARE AWARD : DIGITAL ART PRIZE 2008

Subject<BR>
Piemonte Share Festival announces the second edition
of the Share Prize 2008 for digital art.
The competition jury will award a prize of  E2,500.00
to the work (published or unpublished) which best
represents experimentation between arts and new
technologies.<BR>
<span class="bluetext">(((I am the chairman of this competition jury.
Yes, me!  As all entrants to Viridian Design Contests
know, I take such duties with lethal seriousness.
Are you an experimental new-media digital-arts
type with a hankering to stun all Europe?  You
are?  Then trot that thing over pronto.)))</span></P>

<P>The candidates for the prize (a short list of a
maximum of 6 competitors) will be guests at the 4th
edition of the Share Festival, taking place in Turin
March 2008 at the Accademia Albertina di Belle Arti,

Share Festival, by preparing his or her work of art,
to be properly evaluated by jury and public.</P>

<P>The organization is available at offering all the
costs regarding the preparation of the 6 selected
works as well as travel and accommodation expenses
for the artists, and, possibly, the prize itself.
<span class="bluetext">(((That's right, we will FLY YOU TO EUROPE and
likely feed you spaghetti there, given that the Euro
is at an unprecedented $1.38.  That'll  might
even make up for mysterious Italian withholding
taxes on the Italian prize.)))</span></P>
