vigorously rebuilding their former fossil-fuel car

metropolis.)))</span><BR>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((It's fabulous to be on the ground where Europeans
are visibly re-creating their infrastructure in such
a design-centric, immediate fashion.  There's something
exhilarating about it... because it's not a Viridian
Pope-Emperor theoretical design engagement; I mean,
they're literally ripping up the street outside here
and installing light urban rail.  I wouldn't call it
Oz; it's just an Italian industrial burg;
but their previous situation was just so grim, glum,
unbearable, palpably doomed and clearly unsustainable
that they pretty much had to swallow the blue pill
and  leap for the unknown.  So they suffered ==
but changed.  Now one sees eerie stuff like THIS ==
a smokestack turned into a steeple dedicated to the
Shroud of Turin.)))</span></P>

I hope to learn something useful about real-world,
hands-on, down-and-dirty, urban sociotechnical

unsustainable.  Changing that is the work of the
world.  It's happening.)))</span></P>

Solzhenitsyn in the midst of a dark regime.

to look at Nobelist Solzhenitsyn and think:
"Well, we can't give up on 'em; here's this
heroic guy endlessly scraping up and archiving

a lead from Al's own sobering response.  Al's not
making any big deal of this. I suspect that's because
Al has sincerely and actually come to realize, on some
bone-deep, post-cynical, wolves-at-the-door
level, that there really is a global climate crisis.
That's not a vehicle for generating Al Gore worship.
It's an emergency.  A deep,  terrible, lasting
emergency whose permanent scars for society all lie
ahead of us.  The Turinese are certainly changing
their local piece of the world == but they got
<STRONG>scourged</STRONG> into changing.  The bright spots here

<P>"Gore: Award Puts Focus on Global Warming</P>

<P>"By SETH BORENSTEIN and LISA LEFF
"The Associated Press<BR>
"Saturday, October 13, 2007; 7:48 AM</P>

<P>"PALO ALTO, Calif. == He spent decades trying to get
the world to listen and believe as he did that global
warming would destroy the planet unless people changed
their behavior, and fast. But after former Vice
President Al Gore and a host of climate scientists
were awarded the Nobel Peace Prize on Friday for
their warnings, Gore took only the briefest of bows
on a live world stage. He avoided the issue of a
U.S. presidential run to 'get back to business' on
'a planetary emergency.'</P>

<P>"'For my part, I will be doing everything I can to
try to understand how to best use the honor and the
recognition from this award as a way of speeding up
the change in awareness and the change in urgency,'
Gore said at the offices of the Alliance For Climate
Protection, a nonprofit he founded last year to
engage citizens in solving the problem.</P>


<P>(...)</P>

<P>"If he felt any sense of triumph over the political
and scientific critics who belittled or ignored
his message, Gore did not betray it during his only
public appearance Friday. He learned of his award
at 2 a.m. while watching the live TV announcement _
hearing his name amid the Norwegian  <span class="bluetext">(((aren't
those guys Swedes?)))</span>  at his apartment in San
Francisco.</P>

<P>"Nine hours later, his tone was somber and his
remarks brief. With his wife, Tipper, and four
Stanford University climate scientists who were
co-authors of the international climate report at
his side, he referenced a recent report that
concluded the ice caps at the North Pole are
melting faster than previously thought and
could be gone in 23 years without dramatic action.</P>


<P>"Gore said he planned to donate his share of the
$1.5 million prize to the nonprofit alliance he chairs.</P>

<P>"This is a chance to elevate global consciousness
about the challenges that we face now," he said...</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((I see Al's not living in San Francisco for nothing.
Global consciousness, rock concerts, yeah, thanks
a lot, sir.  You deserve the prize. Congrats.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((In the meantime, I wanted to share this long
and remarkable document, which details a grueling
transition undergone by a society which, unlike
Torino, isn't all glossy, Eurocentric and designery.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Nobody imagines that life changes much in Cuba,
because the same dictator's been running things
for half a century.  I just saw a local presentation
by an exiled Cuban author == (periodically, Cuban
agents try to push her under a Parisian bus) == and she
said that the worst thing about being an exiled
Cuban dissident in Europe is that Europeans
somehow imagine that Cuba is a socialist paradise
with free healthcare and cool mambo music. Also,
Che had such a cool haircut and beret.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Just because US Republicans
don't like them doesn't mean they're great, okay?
They're authoritarian Reds on a scrawny island
whose lives are pitifully delimited in all kinds
of bleak, hairshirt-Marxist, soul-crushing ways.
This article is by an American leftie Cuban
sympathizer who's all perky about how the Cubans
transcended their energy emergency.  It's all about
emergency living.  Except you'd never guess it
by the way it's phrased.  It's a long, long article,
but it serves pretty well as an unintentionally
sinister portrait of an oppressed, hapless, stricken
society in a no-kidding, tear-the-walls down
Greenhouse emergency.)))</span></P>

<P>"The power of community: How Cuba survived peak oil</P>

<P>By Megan Quinn,  Permaculture Activist</P>

<P>First published on Sunday, February 26, 2006</P>

<P>Havana, Cuba == At the Organip&oacute;nico de Alamar,
a neighborhood agriculture project, a workers'
collective runs a large urban farm, a produce
market and a restaurant.</P>

<P>"Hand tools and human labor replace oil-driven
machinery. Worm cultivation and composting create
productive soil. Drip irrigation conserves water,
and the diverse, multi-hued produce provides the
community with a rainbow of healthy foods.</P>


<P><span class="bluetext">(((I want you to stop here and try to imagine
the stark reality of a Communist restaurant run
by a workers' collective.  In former Communist
countries like Russia, there aren't any left.  Because
those are not "restaurants." The chef hates you.
There aren't any "waiters."  You have no reason
to be there and they do not want to feed you.)))</span></P>

<P>In other Havana neighborhoods, lacking enough land
for such large projects, residents have installed
raised garden beds on parking lots and planted
vegetable gardens on their patios and rooftops.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Did you ever wonder why people <STRONG>stopped</STRONG>
planting "Victory Gardens" after World War II
ended?  Because farming parking-lots is hard work.
All farming is hard work. That's why subsistence
farmers flee farms and go to urban slums.)))</span></P>

<P>Since the early 1990s, an urban agriculture movement
has swept through Cuba, putting this capital city
of 2.2 million on a path toward sustainability.
<span class="bluetext">(((Fidel Castro == a prince of sustainability.
Hasta La Sustainability Siempre.  "Thank you
Comrade, my vegetable hash from that parking lot
was very sustainable.")))</span></P>

<P>A small group of Australians assisted in this
grass-roots effort, coming to this Caribbean island
nation in 1993 to teach permaculture, a system
based on sustainable agriculture which uses far
less energy.  <span class="bluetext">(((I don't have a problem with
Australians going to assist the Revolution == I
think everybody oughta go to Cuba, and Eastern
Europe is even more eye-opening == but is it
"grass roots" when Australian politicals are doing
it?  In the old unashamed days, that used to be
"Communist International Solidarity," not
sustainable grass roots.)))</span></P>

<P>This need to bring agriculture into the city began
with the fall of the Soviet Union and the loss of
more than 50 percent of Cuba's oil imports, much of
its food and 85 percent of its trade economy.
<span class="bluetext">(((This is a risk one takes when one gets all
chummy with petrocratic states. They turn the fuel
tap off?  Man, you're toast == just like a Californian
in the Enron glory days.)))</span></P>

<P>Transportation halted, people went hungry and
the average Cuban lost 30 pounds. <span class="bluetext">(((I didn't
believe this assertion at first. I mean, try
to imagine the law-and-order problems in an
American suburb where the average American ==
the <STRONG>average!</STRONG> == lost thirty pounds of body weight
from lack of groceries.  And average Americans have
got thirty pounds to lose, easy.)))</span></P>

<P>"In reality, when this all began, it was a necessity.
People had to start cultivating vegetables wherever
they could," a tour guide told a documentary crew
filming in Cuba in 2004 to record how Cuba survived
on far less oil than usual.  <span class="bluetext">(((These "tour guide"
Potemkin figures are kind of a vanishing breed,
but you run into 'em sometimes... I hate to say
that they make Fox News look accurate.  Nobody
can do <STRONG>that.</STRONG>)))</span></P>

<P>The crew included the staff of The Community
Solution, a non-profit organization in Yellow
Springs, Ohio which teaches about peak oil == the
time when oil production world-wide will reach
an all-time high and head into an irreversible
decline. Some oil analysts believe this may
happen within this decade, making Cuba a role
model to follow.  <span class="bluetext">(((Activists of every stripe
always imagine that they're "teaching" stuff.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">((("Teaching" peak oil... or, you could just be in an
oil-dependent power that loses an oil war.
Or petrocrats could just charge whatever they
please for the stuff.  Oil doesn't have to
actually run out for the lights to go off,
as Californians should remember keenly. Cuba
didn't have a "peak," they just had no fuel.)))</span></P>

<P>"We wanted to see if we could capture what it is
in the Cuban people and the Cuban culture that
allowed them to go through this very difficult time,"
said Pat Murphy, The Community Solution's executive
director.  <span class="bluetext">(((Amazing how they gazed raptly at "people"
and "culture" rather than the Cuban secret police,
party apparatus and army.)))</span></P>

<P>"Cuba has a lot to show the world in how to deal
with energy adversity."  <span class="bluetext">(((That part, I'm buying.
Cuba shows all kinds of stuff, most of it about
as attractive as watching your grandma drop
thirty pounds from hunger.)))</span></P>

<P>Scarce petroleum supplies have not only transformed
Cuba's agriculture. The nation has also moved toward
small-scale renewable energy and developed an energy-
saving mass transit system, while maintaining its
government-provided health care system whose
preventive, locally-based approach to medicine
conserves scarce resources.<BR>
<span class="bluetext">(((Closely study how this paragraph of perky
eco-geek-speak paraphrases the stark reality that
Cuba went broke and the people went desperately
hungry.  If an eco-calamity makes you lose thirty
pounds, you'll be hearing a lot of this.)))</span></P>

<P>The era in Cuba following the Soviet collapse is
known to Cubans as the Special Period. <span class="bluetext">(((Oh
brother.)))</span></P>

<P>Cuba lost 80 percent of its export market and
its imports fell by 80 percent. The Gross Domestic
Product dropped by more than one third.</P>

<P>"Try to image an airplane suddenly losing its engines.
It was really a crash," Jorge Mario, a Cuban
economist, told the documentary crew.</P>


<P>A crash that put Cuba into a state of shock.</P>

<P>There were frequent blackouts in its oil-fed
electric power grid, up to 16 hours per day.
The average daily caloric intake in Cuba dropped
by a third.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Now try to imagine yourself being Al Gore
and watching this happen on a planetary scale.
You think Al is gonna clutch his prize certificate
and think, "Wow, I got the Nobel for warning
about this sort of thing?"  That's why he's got
that glum look.  He's paying attention.)))</span></P>

<P>According to a report on Cuba from Oxfam, an
international development and relief agency:
"In the cities, buses stopped running, generators
stopped producing electricity, factories became
silent as graveyards. Obtaining enough food for
the day became the primary activity for many,
if not most, Cubans."  <span class="bluetext">(((Note that Oxfam doesn't
chime in about how Cubans got all sustainable and
carbon-neutral due to imitating graveyards.)))</span></P>

<P>In part due to the continuing US embargo, but
also because of the loss of a foreign market,
Cuba couldn't obtain enough imported food.
Furthermore, without a substitute for fossil-fuel
based large-scale farming, agricultural production
dropped drastically.</P>

<P>So Cubans started to grow local organic produce
out of necessity, developed bio-pesticides and
bio-fertilizers as petrochemical substitutes,
and incorporated more fruits and vegetables into
their diets.</P>

<P>Since they couldn't fuel their aging cars, they
walked, biked, rode buses, and carpooled.</P>


<P>"There are infinite small solutions," said Roberto
Sanchez from the Cuban-based Foundation for
Nature and Humanity.  <span class="bluetext">(((You gotta love an
entity with a soft, mushy title like that one.)))</span></P>

<P>"Crises or changes or problems can trigger many
of these things which are basically adaptive.
We are adapting."  <span class="bluetext">(((In the climate crisis,
we're gonna hear a lot of this kind of glum
ideological lacquer.  "The lawn is on fire!
There's a flood in the basement!"  "Stop
whining, for such problems trigger a basically
adaptive behavior."  You wouldn't want to rebel
against Nature and Humanity, I hope.)))</span></P>

<P>A New Agricultural Revolution</P>

<P>Cubans are also replacing petroleum-fed machinery
with oxen, <span class="bluetext">(((boy, there's a step forward == ask
any Indian)))</span> and their urban agriculture reduces
food transportation distances. Today an estimated
50 percent of Havana's vegetables come from inside
the city, <span class="bluetext">(((outdoing the siege of Stalingrad)))</span>
while in other Cuban towns and cities urban gardens
produce from 80 percent to more than 100 percent of
what they need.   <span class="bluetext">(((You've got too many squash
and green beans in that dirtpile where you used to
own a car. "Wow, I have more than 100 percent of
what I need!")))</span></P>

<P>In turning to gardening, individuals and neighborhood
organizations <span class="bluetext">(((read: party apparatus)))</span> took the
initiative by identifying idle land in the city,
cleaning it up, and planting.  <span class="bluetext">(((At least, being
a dictatorship of the proletariat, they don't
have much trouble with NIMBYism and eminent domain
issues.)))</span></P>

<P>When the Australian permaculturists came to Cuba they
set up  the first permaculture demonstration project
with a $26,000 grant from the Cuban government.</P>

<P>Out of this grew the Foundation for Nature and
Humanity's urban permaculture demonstration project
and center in Havana.</P>

<P>"With this demonstration, neighbors began to see the
possibilities of what they can do on their rooftops
and their patios," said Carmen L&oacute;pez, director of
the urban permaculture center, as she stood on the
center's rooftop amongst grape vines, potted plants,
and compost bins made from tires.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((It's kind of touching to see these "permaculture
activists" interviewing their own cadres to confirm
the glowing success of their "demonstration
projects.")))</span></P>

<P>Since then the movement has been spreading rapidly
across Havana's barrios. So far L&oacute;pez' urban
permaculture center has trained more than 400 people
in the neighborhood in permaculture and distributes
a monthly publication, "El Permacultor." <span class="bluetext">(((That
sounds pretty great until you realize we've got
two thousand people in Viridian List and we never
even got a Cuban state grant.)))</span></P>

<P>"Not only has the community learned about
permaculture," according to L&oacute;pez, "we have also
learned about the community, helping people wherever
there is need."  <span class="bluetext">(((Given that Marxism is all about
that issue, you have to wonder what they've been
learning since Fidel took power in the early 1960s.)))</span></P>


<P>One permaculture student, Nelson Aguila, an
engineer-turned-farmer,  <span class="bluetext">(((and this represents
a major civilizational advance, presumably)))</span>
raises food for the neighborhood on his integrated
rooftop farm. On just a few hundred square feet he
has rabbits and hens and many large pots of plants.</P>

<P>Running free on the floor are gerbils, which eat
the waste from the rabbits, and become an important
protein source themselves. <span class="bluetext">((("Mom!  Mom, the
former engineer has brought us gerbils!"  I hope
they've got this post-slaughter waste-consumption
thing cleared with the spongiform encephalopathy.
What do they feed the gerbil waste to?)))</span></P>

<P>"Things are changing," Sanchez said. "It's a local
economy. In other places people don't know their
neighbors. They don't know their names. People don't
say 'hello' to each other. Not here."  <span class="bluetext">(((Yeah ==
because if you don't have a steady source for
fried gerbils, you're gonna lose thirty pounds.)))</span></P>

<P>Since going from petrochemical intensive agricultural
production to organic farming and gardening, Cuba
now uses 21 times less pesticide than before the
Special Period.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((That phrase "Before the Special Period" sure has
a chilly tang, doesn't it?  "Did you know Al Gore
once won the Nobel?"  "Oh, that was Before the Special
Period."  "Both my grandparents were alive Before
the Special Period."  "Before the Special Period,
these tires were on my car instead of serving
as compost heaps.")))</span></P>


<P>They have accomplished this with their large-scale
production of bio-pesticides and bio-fertilizers,
exporting some of it to other Latin American countries.
<span class="bluetext">(((Until Chavez started shipping them subsidized
oil, and then, whew!  Thank God!)))</span></P>

<P>Though the transition to organic production and animal
traction was necessary, the Cubans are now seeing the
advantages.</P>

<P>"One of the good parts of the crisis was to go back
to the oxen," said Miguel Coyula, a community
development specialist. "Not only do they save fuel,
they do not compact the soil the way the tractor
does, and the legs of the oxen churn the earth."</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((I hate to think of a place where farmers hide
their tractors from the "community development
specialists."  When you think how many bad Socialist
Realist novels were written about the heroic
effort to <STRONG>get</STRONG> tractors...  In the peasants
and workers states, Communism and tractors were
practically synonymous.  But no, now those dainty
little oxen hooves have become organic plows
somehow... yeah, a political rhetoric is a
multipurpose tool.)))</span></P>

<P>"The Cuban agricultural, conventional, 'Green
Revolution' system never was able to feed the people,"
Sanchez said. "It had high yields, but was oriented
to plantation agriculture. We exported citrus,
tobacco, sugar cane and we imported the basic things.
So the system, even in the good times, never
fulfilled people's basic needs."</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Yeah, and once the Russians, who bought those
exports, shut off the taps, trade withered and the
island could suddenly aspire to the autonomous status
of glorious North Korea.)))</span></P>

<P>Drawing on his permaculture knowledge, Sanchez said,
"You have to follow the natural cycles, so you hire
nature to work for you, not work against nature. To
work against nature, you have to waste huge amounts
of energy."  <span class="bluetext">(((Isn't "hiring" nature just a tad
exploitative?  Where's nature's union and free
health system?)))</span></P>

<P>Energy Solutions<BR>
Because most of Cuba's electricity had been
generated from imported oil, the shortages affected
nearly everyone on the island. <span class="bluetext">(((One wonders
who the unaffected were.  Security services,
I'd be guessing.)))</span></P>

<P>Scheduled rolling blackouts several days per week
lasted for many years.</P>

<P>Without refrigerators, food would spoil.</P>

<P>Without electric fans, the heat was almost unbearable
in a country that regularly has temperatures in the
80s and 90s.  <span class="bluetext">(((Or higher.  Most every summer.)))</span></P>

<P>The solutions to Cuba's energy problems were not easy.
<span class="bluetext">(((Though I don't doubt there was some hairshirt
ideologue  eager to make all that sound
progressive.)))</span></P>

<P>Without money, it couldn't invest in nuclear power
and new conventional fossil fuel plants or even
large-scale wind and solar energy systems.
Instead, the country focused on reducing energy
consumption and implementing small-scale
renewable energy projects.  <span class="bluetext">(((Yeah, that sounds
all grass-rootsy and romantic till you get to those
years of rolling blackouts and the spoilt food.)))</span></P>

<P><BR>
Ecosol Solar and Cuba Solar are two renewable energy
organizations leading the way. They help develop
markets for renewable energy, sell and install
systems, perform research, publish newsletters,
and do energy efficiency studies for large users.
<span class="bluetext">(((Reading stuff like this can be a useful corrective.
Like: somewhere in this world is the world's most
evil, backward and exploitative solar energy company.
I'm not saying they're in Cuba == maybe they're
a merciless voodoo warlord solar-energy company
somewhere in the war-torn Congo. But they're
somewhere, and they've got solar panels and they're
awful.)))</span></P>

<P>Ecosol Solar has installed 1.2 megawatts of solar
photovoltaic in both small household systems
(200 watt capacity) and large systems (15-50 kilowatt
capacity). In the United States 1.2 megawatts would
provide electricity to about 1000 homes, but can
supply power to significantly more houses in Cuba
where appliances are few, conservation is the
custom, and the homes are much smaller.  <span class="bluetext">(((And
the homes smell of solar-fried gerbils.)))</span></P>

<P><BR>
About 60 percent of Ecosol Solar's installations go
to social programs to power homes, schools, medicals
facilities, and community centers in rural Cuba.
<span class="bluetext">(((Look, the entire island is a "social program"
and "community center." It's a Communist society.
If you don't count hard-currency hotels packed
with guys spending euros.)))</span></P>


<P>It recently installed solar photovoltaic panels
to electrify 2,364 primary schools throughout rural
Cuba where it was not cost effective to take the grid.
In addition, it is developing compact model solar
water heaters that can be assembled in the field,
water pumps powered by PV panels, and solar dryers.
<span class="bluetext">(((This is teaching an entire generation of rural
Cuban kids to hate solar power as the very symbol
of their backwardness, but what the heck; there's
no power in their grid anyway, and maybe they'll
at least learn to read.)))</span></P>

<P>A visit to "Los Tumbos," a solar-powered community
in the rural hills southwest of Havana demonstrates
the positive impact that these strategies can have.
Once without electricity, each household now has a
small solar panel that powers a radio and a lamp.</P>

<P>Larger systems provide electricity to the school,
hospital, and community room, where residents gather
to watch the evening news program called the "Round
Table." <span class="bluetext">(((Yeah, I bet that program's real newsy.)))</span></P>

<P>Besides keeping the residents informed, the television
room has the added benefit of bringing the community
together.  <span class="bluetext">(((Has Jerry Mander been informed of
this?)))</span></P>

<P>"The sun was enough to maintain life on earth for
millions of years," said Bruno Beres, a director of
Cuba Solar. "Only when we [humans] arrived and
changed the way we use energy was the sun not enough.
So the problem is with our society, not with the
world of energy."  <span class="bluetext">(((The invention of fire was
also clearly a problem.)))</span></P>

<P>Transportation - A System of Ride Sharing
<span class="bluetext">(((It just trundles right along, bearing its
bundles of red-green ideological joy.)))</span></P>

<P>Cubans also faced the problem of providing
transportation on a reduced energy diet.</P>

<P>Solutions came from ingenious Cubans, who often
quote the phrase, "Necessity is the mother of
invention."</P>

<P>With little money or fuel, Cuba now moves masses
of people during rush hour in Havana. In an
inventive approach, virtually every form of vehicle,
large and small, was used to build this mass
transit system. Commuters ride in hand-made
wheelbarrows, buses, other motorized transport
and animal-powered vehicles.  <span class="bluetext">(((Even if Cubans
are "the masses," a heterogenous crawl of
hand-made wheelbarrows is not a "mass transit
system.")))</span></P>

<P>One special Havana transit vehicle, nicknamed a
"camel," is a very large metal semi-trailer,
pulled by a standard semi-truck tractor, which
holds 300 passengers.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((The "Transportation of Cuba Pool."  Man,
FlickR is awesome.)))</span><BR>

<P>Bicycles and motorized two-passenger rickshaws are
also prevalent in Havana, while horse drawn carts
and large old panel trucks are used in the smaller
towns.  <span class="bluetext">(((Large old <STRONG>heavily polluting</STRONG> panel
trucks, but let's gloss over that.)))</span></P>

<P>Government officials in yellow garb pull over nearly
empty government vehicles and trucks on Havana's
streets and fill them with people needing a ride.
Chevys from the 1950s cruise along with four people
in front and four more in back.
<span class="bluetext">(((Imagine the joy of being brusquely waved to the
curb by one of these "government officials in
yellow garb.")))</span></P>

<P>A donkey cart with a taxi license nailed to the
frame also travels Cuba's streets. Many trucks were
converted to passenger transport by welding steps to
the back so riders could get on and off with ease.
<span class="bluetext">(((Scientific socialist production buries inefficient
capital, making the exploitation of man by man
a thing of the past.)))</span></P>

<P>Health Care and Education - National Priorities</P>

<P>Even though Cuba is a poor country, with a per
capita Gross Domestic Product of only $3,000 per year
(putting them in the bottom third of all nations),
life expectancy is the same as in the U.S., and
infant mortality is below that in the U.S.</P>

<P>The literacy rate in Cuba is 97 percent, the same
as in the U.S. Cuba's education system, as well as
its medical system is free.  <span class="bluetext">(((I'm all for free
health care, but not really nuts about the prospect
of being in the bottom third of all nations.  You'd
think that a society with so much savoir faire
and unleashed ingenuity would rank in a little above,
say, fascist-plagued Chile.)))</span></P>

<P>When Cubans suffered through their version of a peak
oil crisis, they maintained their free medical system,
one of the major factors that helped them to survive.
Cubans repeatedly emphasize how proud they are of
their system.  <span class="bluetext">(((Cue agitprop.)))</span></P>

<P>Before the Cuban Revolution in 1959, there was one
doctor for every 2000 people. Now there is a doctor
for every 167 people. Cuba also has an international
medical school and trains doctors to work in other
poor countries. Each year there are 20,000 Cuban
doctors abroad doing this kind of work.  <span class="bluetext">(((With
the obligatory nationalist bragging taken care of,
we can now return to the topic of permaculture.)))</span></P>

<P>With meat scarce and fresh local vegetables in
abundance since 1995, Cubans now eat a healthy,
low-fat, nearly vegetarian, diet. They also have
a healthier outdoor lifestyle and walking and
bicycling have become much more common.</P>

<P>"Before, Cubans didn't eat that many vegetables.
Rice and beans and pork meat was the basic diet,"
Sanchez from the Foundation for Nature and
Humanity said. "At some point necessity taught
them, and now they demand [vegetables]."  <span class="bluetext">(((I
wonder what they really demand.  I bet they
wouldn't turn up their noses at a 14-ounce
T-bone steak with all the trimmings.)))</span></P>

<P>Doctors and nurses live in the community where they
work and usually above the clinic itself. In remote
rural areas, three-story buildings are constructed
with the doctor's office on the bottom floor and
two apartments on the second and third floors,
one for the doctor and one for the nurse.  <span class="bluetext">(((In
other words, the Cuban medical profession is
a rural mom-and-pop shop.)))</span></P>

<P>In the cities, the doctors and nurses always live
in the neighborhoods they serve. They know the
families of their patients and try to treat people
in their homes.</P>

<P>"Medicine is a vocation, not a job," exclaimed a
Havana doctor, demonstrating the motivation for her
work. In Cuba 60 percent of the doctors are women.
<span class="bluetext">(((One wonders why pink-collar jobs are ritually
demeaned and disenfranchised == likely its this
time-honored willingness of women to go out and
labor for social-capital rather than actual pay.)))</span></P>


<P>Education is considered the most important social
activity in Cuba. Before the revolution, there was
one teacher for every 3,000 people. Today the ratio
is one for every 42 people, with a teacher-student
ratio of 1 to 16. Cuba has a higher percentage of
professionals than most developing countries, and
with 2 percent of the population of Latin America,
Cuba has 11 percent of all the scientists.
<span class="bluetext">(((Another state poster glued here... how come
all these teachers and scientists can't boost
the economy out of the bottom ranks? China is
Communist, everybody hates and fears them much
more than they do Cubans, and yet they're rockin'
it.)))</span></P>

<P>In an effort to halt migration from the countryside
to the city during the Special Period,  <span class="bluetext">(((try
to imagine the scenes of woe and mayhem there)))</span>
higher  education was spread out into the provinces,
expanding learning opportunities and strengthening
rural communities. <span class="bluetext">(((Kind of a "send those weak
intelligentsia to the countryside" Red Guard
innovation.   Bet those scientists got a lot of
labwork done in those quiet, scholastic retreats.)))</span></P>

<P>Before the Special Period there were only three
institutions of higher learning in Cuba. Now there
are 50 colleges and universities throughout the
country, seven in Havana.  <span class="bluetext">(((Why?)))</span></P>

<P>The Power of Community</P>

<P>Throughout its travels, the documentary crew saw
and experienced the resourcefulness, determination,
and optimism of the Cuban people, often hearing the
phrase "S&iacute;, se puede" or "Yes it can be done."
<span class="bluetext">(((They're also a handsome people who can dance
like angels and their ice cream is really tasty.)))</span></P>

<P>People spoke of the value of "resistir" or
"resistance," showing their determination to overcome
obstacles. And they have lived under a U.S. economic
blockade since the early 1960s, viewed as the
ultimate test of the Cuban ability to resist.
<span class="bluetext">(((The US has  lived under a Cuban economic
blockade since the early 1960s, leading American
food producers to put fructose corn syrup into
prepared foods instead of Cuban sugarcane
sucrose sugar, causing hapless Americans to bloat as
drastically as overfed Cuban gerbils.  Also,
no decent cigars.)))</span></P>

<P>There is much to learn from Cuba's response to the
loss of cheap and abundant oil. <span class="bluetext">(((Yeah.  It shows
that a repellent regime deprived of oil fails
to collapse, becoming even more repellent, while
disguising the sufferings of the population with
wads of predigested green rhetoric.  And: no matter
how bad things get in the climate crisis, there's
gonna be some moron wandering around claiming
that all the mayhem is great and should be construed
as a civilizational advance.  Pray that this guy
doesn't have a gun, a uniform and the power of
arrest.)))</span></P>

<P>The staff of The Community Solution sees these
lessons as especially important for people in
developing countries, who make up 82 percent of
the world's population and live more on life's edge.
<span class="bluetext">(((Yeah: "Third World" people, always be leary of
white guys with "appropriate" "solutions" that they
would never dream of imposing on themselves.)))</span></P>

<P>But developed countries are also vulnerable to
shortages in energy. And with the coming onset of
peak oil, all countries will have to adapt to the
reality of a lower energy world.</P>

<P>With this new reality, the Cuban government changed
its 30-year motto from "Socialism or Death" to
"A Better World is Possible."  <span class="bluetext">(((Did Cuba really
do that? That's like changing the motto "Of the
People, By the People, For the People" to "How
about some extra fries with that?")))</span></P>

<P><BR>
Government officials allowed private entrepreneurial
farmers  <span class="bluetext">((("kulak class enemies")))</span> and neighborhood
organizations <span class="bluetext">((("Marxist party cadres")))</span> to use
public land to grow and sell their produce.</P>

<P>They pushed decision-making down to the grassroots
level and encouraged initiatives in their
neighborhoods. <span class="bluetext">((("You're on your own, sucker.")))</span></P>

<P>They created more provinces. <span class="bluetext">(((Don't blame
Castro, blame the provincial flak-catchers.)))</span></P>

<P>They encouraged migration back to the farms and
rural areas and reorganized their provinces to be
in-line with agricultural needs.  <span class="bluetext">(((Forced relocation
out of cities before they implode.)))</span></P>

<P>From The Community Solution's viewpoint, <span class="bluetext">(((I
know I've been going on a bit here, but this is
ALL the "Community Solution's viewpoint" == this
whole thing is a put-up job without a whisper of
dissent)))</span> Cuba did what it could to survive,
despite its ideology of a centralized economy.</P>

<P>In the face of peak oil and declining oil production,
will America do what it takes to survive, in spite
of its ideology of individualism and consumerism?
<span class="bluetext">(((Why not worry about Australia?  They've got
the very same problems, plus no rain.)))</span></P>

<P>Will Americans come together in community, as
Cubans did, in the spirit of sacrifice and mutual
support?  <span class="bluetext">(((Or will we all end up in the handbasket
to hell of Cuban reality, with spies on every block,
commandeered cars crammed with strangers, wheelbarrow
traffic jams and food grown on the levelled sites
of former strip malls and fried-food shacks?  Yes,
yes, I know this sounds very James Howard Kunstler
== there are times when one has to appreciate the
prophet of a long emergency.  At least the guy
writes in real English instead of a numbing, tapioca
nomenklatura-ese.)))</span></P>

<P>"There is climate change, the price of oil, the crisis
of energy," Beres from Cuba Solar said, listing off
the challenges humanity faces. "What we must know is
that the world is changing and we must change the
way we see the world."</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Or we can face the facts on the ground without
blinding ourselves with political spin, which may
be Al Gore's greatest gift to his fellow politicals.
He knows they're in major trouble even if they can't
force inconvenient truths out of their mouths.)))</span></P>
