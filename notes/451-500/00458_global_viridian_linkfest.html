<span class="bluetext">(((Nice colored map of the relatively-searing
Arctic transformation here. I've heard tell that
last year was the hottest year in over a hundred
years. And in 1200 years. And in a million years.)))</span></P>

Tough break for George Deutsch, the climate-denial
and anti-evolution commissar who wormed his way,
despite credentials, into NASA's public relations.
"NASA, accused of censoring its scientists on global
warming and the origin of the universe, pledged on
Wednesday to reform its policies to ensure "open and
full communications."</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.antievolution.org/features/wedge.html">http://www.antievolution.org/features/wedge.html</A><br />
<span class="bluetext">(((Of course, young George Deutsch is just one of many.
Check out these scarifying fanatics "destroying
scientific materialism" through their web activism.
Bolsheviks couldn't be any more cocksure. They're
the self-proclaimed "Center for the Renewal of
Science and Culture.")))</span><BR>
<span class="bluetext">(((That lethally mendacious astroturf title of theirs
reminds me: I sure haven't heard much out of the
"Greening Earth Society" lately.)))</span><br><br>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Please let me know if you detect any public sign
of Chris Paynter or Ned Leonard, former Greening Earth
spinmeisters. Wherever they are, evil is occurring.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Meanwhile, having perhaps wrecked civilization,
Exxon-Mobil at least made more money while doing it
than any corporation in the history of capitalism.
Grant Exxon this much; it was their money and power
at stake, not sheer love of dumb Lysenkoist spite.
I mean: if they killed us, at least they killed us
for cash.)))</span><BR>

"Exxon Mobil reported Monday it earned more money in
2005 than any company, any year, ever. (...) On the
strength of energy prices that hit all-time highs last
year, Exxon Mobil earned $36.1 billion, equal to the
gross domestic product of Croatia."</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Who paid for Exxon's grand success? New Orleans,
for one. Did you notice when the tornadoes hit
New Orleans five months AFTER Katrina?)))</span></P>

""Don't ever ask the question, `What else could
happen?'" said Marcia Paul Leone, a mortgage banker
who was surveying the new damage to her Katrina-flooded
home." <span class="bluetext">(((Look, Marcia: you need to ask that
question. Other people have their cities at risk,
too. And you're a mortgage banker!)))</span></P>

<p>Fifty years from now: the "Lost City of New Orleans," one among many.<br>

<p>Check this out: from now on, if an "act of nature," like a flood, wildfire, storm or levee breech,  destroys your fossil-fueled rental car from Hertz, you have to pay the damage. Kind of says it all,  doesn't it? The climate damage was distributed among everybody with a car-key, and now, so is the liability.<br>

hurricanes, mind you. Imagine a Ninth Ward Manhattan.<br>

<P>If the Homeland Security Department were underwater
instead of the New Orleans, American emergency
responses might actually improve. "Homeland Security"
was invented during the Bush Administration, and it's Brownies top to bottom, folks.<br>

"Blinding lack of situational awareness and disjointed
decision making needlessly compounded and prolonged
Katrina's horror."</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((American climate-change politics: Blinding lack
of situational awareness. Ideological Lysenkoism.
Frenetic, obscurantist media campaigns. And
ever-worsening unnatural disasters, with bills
that can't be met.)))</span></P>

"In many respects, our report is a litany of mistakes,
misjudgments, lapses and absurdities all cascading
together, blinding us to what was coming and hobbling
any collective effort to respond." <span class="bluetext">(((Journalism is
the first draft of history: that's the American
Greenhouse post-mortem, freshly written in the blood
of New Orleans.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((May I point out that the Canadians just elected
a government that doesn't believe in climate change,
either? Even though the good people of Canada are
sitting right next to the thawing North Pole, and
watching foreign ships zoom by their shores in areas
that used to be ice?)))</span><BR>

The awesome scale of the Greenhouse, by the numbers.</P>

<P>Certain evangelicals are realizing that climate
change might hurt them, too.<BR>

looming over a baffled and terrified mankind are
a major recruitment opportunity. Chapter and verse!
It couldn't be any clearer!<BR>

"The God of the Bible proclaims to control the weather.
In other scriptures He says He dries up rivers,
controls the seas and works in the whirlwinds.
He also says that He will curse a nation that
refuses to obey His laws by turning the heaven
into iron and the earth into brass. Men will spend
their strength in vain trying to gain an increase.
See Leviticus 26 and Isaiah 29:6.<BR>
"America, Britain, Australia and Canada are<BR>
experiencing these curses because God wants them
to repent of their disobedience. Salubrious weather
is a natural blessing that comes with obedience to
God's laws. As long as His laws are trampled upon,
God will continue to correct us so we will change
our evil ways."<BR>
<span class="bluetext">(((See that? We're seeing the emergence of Greenhouse
Fundamentalism. It'll be very interesting to see
the inevitable Fundie-Islamic spin on this same issue.
Maybe if it were made clearer to them, with some
cartoons.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Speaking of religion, nationalism, climate, and
terror, imagine you are the nation of Georgia.
Imagine that Muslim Chechnyan terrorists, or possibly
a former superpower, or both, go out and blow up
your natural-gas pipelines in the dead of winter.
Well, that's a complete political and economic
calamity. You've still got the Army, though, right?
Kind of Khaki Green possibility there! However, it
turns out the Army's no good, either.)))</span><BR>

the pipelines, Georgia. Look at yourself. Thanks
to fossil fuels, you're a state-collapse waiting to
happen.)))</span><BR>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Russia, whose economy is fantastically corrupt,
used to tremble at the hands of skeptical currency
speculators. Now who cares about mere transparency?
Russia sells gas and oil! So to hell with you, Soros,
euro, dollar, yen, rupee, renminbi: we're Russia,
and we can still sell gas and oil! In fact, if we
took a leaf out of the Chavez book and turned into
oil-selling COMMUNISTS, you'd STILL have to buy our
oil. You know what? In 2006, oil's bigger than capitalism
and democracy put together!)))</span><BR>

<span class="bluetext">(((Just listen to the lucid, golden rhetoric of
these Swedish bureaucrats.)))</span></P>

<P>"Climate change is the greatest and most important
environmental challenge of our time. Most of the
world's climate researchers agree that the Earth's
climate system is changing == and in order to slow
down these changes, emissions of greenhouse gases
must be reduced. The Government is therefore setting
a new policy target: the creation of the conditions
necessary to break Sweden's dependence on fossil
fuels by 2020."</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Couldn't have recommended a better policy myself!
Thank you, Sweden! 2020, eh? Wow, that's a mere
eight years after the official date of the expiration
of the Viridian Movement, in 2012!)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Who would have thought, back in 1998, that by 2006,
our arcane issues would be major news, around the
planet, every dang day? Well, I did think that.
But that's not what I wanted to see. What I wanted to
see was intelligent awareness of the genuine scope of
the problem, and effective response. And maybe, here
and there, in growing bits and pieces, I'm seeing
some.)))</span></P>
