Gore: Make All US Electricity From Renewable Sources<br>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Or, "American politician schemes to save
civilization."  It's curious how Al Gore's thinking
repeatedly circles around nets and grids.  This is
one of his better net-and-grid concepts.  It's an
ambitious scheme, but certainly no more ambitious
than his father's Eisenhower-era Interstate Highway
System, a scheme so modest and useful that,
by the standards of the early Cold War, it almost
vanished in the noise of other federal activity.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Gore refers repeatedly here to the weakness
and the imperilled state of the American political
system and its national government, and, yes,
despite a huge, unilaterally powerful military
force, the government of the USA is clearly very
weak now,  almost weak enough to drown in a
bathtub.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((On the other hand, there is no other prominent
political figure from any other nation-state who is
thinking this creatively.  So, Al's got some right
to frame his idea as a great last hope.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Objections to Al's idea cannot be framed as
support of a status quo, because the status
quo doesn't exist.  Nor can it be framed as
against a free market, as OPEC is a cartel.
It needs be to be framed as the costs of doing
something as opposed to the population-crushing
costs of doing nothing.)))</span></P>

<P>July 17, 2008<BR>
A Generational Challenge to Repower America<br>
(as  prepared)<BR>
D.A.R. Constitution Hall<BR>
Washington, D.C.</P>

<P>by Al Gore</P>

<P>Ladies and gentlemen:</P>

<P>There are times in the history of our nation when our
very way of life depends upon dispelling illusions
and awakening to the challenge of a present danger.
In such moments, we are called upon to move quickly
and boldly to shake off complacency, throw aside
old habits and rise, clear-eyed and alert, to
the necessity of big changes.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((I would have wished that we
could have eluded this kind of Churchillian
sentiment by successfully making green very Viridian-sexy.
Well, green is indeed sexier than hell now,
that part the consumer society managed to understand.
However, a scheme of Al's size probably can't be sexied-up
into existence; it's too top-down and will
have to be, uhm, voted for.  It may also be
direly necessary so, well, that's why he's
Al and not the loveable guys at Treehugger.com.)))</span></P>

<P>Those who, for whatever reason, refuse to do their part
must either be persuaded to join the effort or
asked to step aside. This is such a moment.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((I wonder where Al plans to put the people
who have stepped aside.  The  United States
population didn't get into this much trouble
for arbitrary reasons.  If you look at the
areas of the USA that merrily voted for Bush
twice, you see a resurgent Confederate States
of America that believes in states' rights,
military adventures, bossism and fundamentalist
Christianity, a weak and impoverished region
that lacks organizational muscle and technocratic
capacity.  Eight years of their policies have
led the former superpower to become as weak and unstable
as the Confederacy.  Where are they going to go?
The last time they screwed up this badly, they
were militarily conquered by fellow Americans
and held at bayonet-point by Reconstruction
carpetbaggers.  For years.)))</span></P>

<P>The survival of the United States of America as we
know it is at risk. And even more &ndash; if more
should be required &ndash; the future of human
civilization is at stake.  <span class="bluetext">(((It gives me little
pleasure to see history repeatedly bearing Al
out.  If he actually were the ozone crank his
enemies insisted he was, I'd sleep so much
easier at night.  By this time, though, the
Ozone Man has taken on the vaporous, smoky
proportions of Banquo's Ghost.)))</span></P>

<P>I don't remember a time in our country when so many
things seemed to be going so wrong simultaneously.
<span class="bluetext">(((What really bothers me is the gathering mayhem
in modest, humble little peaceable societies that
didn't do much of anything to deserve it.)))</span></P>

<P>Our economy is in terrible shape and getting worse, gasoline prices
are increasing dramatically, and so are electricity
rates. Jobs are being outsourced. Home mortgages
are in trouble. Banks, automobile companies and
other institutions we depend upon are under
growing pressure. Distinguished senior business
leaders are telling us that this is just the
beginning unless we find the courage to make
some major changes quickly.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((This is the point where I customarily make
some kind of reference to the downfall of the
Soviet Union, but just google "Collapsnik."
The author was actually there during those
circumstances and he's got a new book out.  If you
think black Russian humor is funny, this guy
is hilarious.)))</span></P>

<P>The climate crisis, in particular, is getting
a lot worse &ndash; much more quickly than predicted.
<span class="bluetext">(((The predictions were too conservative.  Even
Cassandra couldn't get it.  This really needs to
be seen as a failure of the scientific
community.  They let Stockholm syndrome from
their political captors keep them from objectively
following the facts.  We need a much better
scientific look-out system than the ramshackle,
underpowered, all-volunteer one we've got.)))</span></P>

<P>Scientists with access to data from Navy submarines
traversing underneath the North polar ice cap have
warned that there is now a 75 percent chance that
within five years the entire ice cap will completely
disappear during the summer months. This will
further increase the melting pressure on Greenland.
According to experts, the Jakobshavn glacier, one
of Greenland's largest, is moving at a faster
rate than ever before, losing 20 million tons
of ice every day, equivalent to the amount of
water used every year by the residents of New York City.</P>

<P>Two major studies from military intelligence experts
have warned our leaders about the dangerous national
security implications of the climate crisis, including
the possibility of hundreds of millions of
climate refugees destabilizing nations around the world.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((And even when "nations" no longer exist &ndash;
when they're failed states and outside Al's
Westaphalian system entirely &ndash; the climate
crisis further destabilizes the already destabilized.
It's not like a state collapses and then
you get some kind of limbo; it's more like,
a state collapses and you get permanent
refugee flows a la the pre-Westphalian
Thirty Years' War.  The collapse of the USA
would be  <STRONG>start</STRONG> of the big troubles,
not some kind of unimaginable bogey.)))</span></P>

<P>Just two days ago, 27 senior statesmen and retired
military leaders warned of the national security
threat from an "energy tsunami" that would be
triggered by a loss of our access to foreign oil.
Meanwhile, the war in Iraq continues, and now the
war in Afghanistan appears to be getting worse.</P>

<P>And by the way, our weather sure is getting
strange, isn't it?  <span class="bluetext">(((Yes, Al, it certainly is.
My house in Austin was hit by hail four times
this spring.)))</span>  There seem to be more tornadoes
than in living memory, longer droughts, bigger
downpours and record floods.</P>

<P>Unprecedented fires are burning in California and
elsewhere in the American West. Higher temperatures
lead to drier vegetation that makes kindling for
mega-fires of the kind that have been raging in
Canada, Greece, Russia, China, South America,
Australia and Africa. <span class="bluetext">(((It's great to hear
him say this stuff to the face of the American
political class, though it's rather like hearing
Solzhenitzyn mournfully reciting the names of
gulags.)))</span></P>

<P>Scientists in the Department of Geophysics and
Planetary Science at Tel Aviv University tell us
that for every one degree increase in temperature,
lightning strikes will go up another 10 percent.
<span class="bluetext">(((Had a tree in my back yard destroyed by
lightning recently.  Wicked stuff, lighting.)))</span></P>

<P>And it is lightning, after all, that is
principally  responsible for igniting the
conflagration in California today.</P>

<P>Like a lot of people, it seems to me that all
these problems are bigger than any of the
solutions that have thus far been proposed for
them, and that's been worrying me.   <span class="bluetext">(((Well,
so much for Kyoto.  Remember my first Viridian
speech, when I was prophesying that we'd
be winding things up here by, at the very
latest, 2012?  Well, I always had it figured
that Kyoto was kind of a weak-sister thing to
do.  It's like an unfunded Congressional
mandate when what you really need to do is
re-engineer the society's power base.)))</span></P>

<P>I'm convinced that one reason we've seemed
paralyzed in the face of these crises is our
tendency to offer old solutions to each crisis
separately &ndash; without taking the others into
account. And these outdated proposals have not
only been ineffective &ndash; they almost always
make the other crises even worse.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((This is as close as a political system
gets to design thinking.  But, yeah: the fact
that oil now costs arbitrary amounts of
American dollars changes everything.  The
environment is always somebody else's problem &ndash;
it belongs to the "globe" &ndash; but add financial
crisis and military failure and you've got
the recipe for 1989-style upheaval.)))</span></P>

<P>Yet when we look at all three of these seemingly
intractable challenges at the same time, we can
see the common thread running through them,
deeply ironic in its simplicity: our dangerous
over-reliance on carbon-based fuels is at the core
of all three of these challenges &ndash; the economic,
environmental and national security crises.</P>

<P>We're borrowing money from China to buy oil from
the Persian Gulf to burn it in ways that destroy
the planet. Every bit of that's got to change.
<span class="bluetext">(((I want to see the Murdoch <em>Wall Street Journal</em>
and the K Street crowd disagreeing with this.  "No,
Al,  no &ndash;- we're <STRONG>pro</STRONG> on mortaging the America's
future to the Communists so as to enrich the Arabs!
It's the all-American way!")))</span></P>

<P>But if we grab hold of that common thread and
pull it hard, all of these complex problems begin
to unravel and we will find that we're holding
the answer to all of them right in our hand.
The answer is to end our reliance on carbon-based
fuels.  <span class="bluetext">(((Or, alternately, to freeze naked
in the unravelled ruins of our Chinese-made
sweater while bowing the knee to oil shieks,
which would be the robust "free-market"
solution.)))</span></P>

<P>In my search for genuinely effective answers
to the climate crisis, I have held a series of
"solutions summits" with engineers, scientists,
and CEOs.  <span class="bluetext">(((Al actually talks to scientists.
Furthermore, he understands what they say.
Thats why he keeps miraculously re-appearing
in American political life on the factual side
of large arguments.)))</span></P>

<P>In those discussions, one thing has become
abundantly clear: when you  connect the dots,
it turns out that the real solutions to the
climate crisis are the very same measures needed
to renew our economy and escape the trap of
ever-rising energy prices. Moreover, they are
also the very same solutions we need to guarantee
our national security without having to go to war
in the Persian Gulf.</P>


<P><span class="bluetext">(((Actually, wars in the Persian Gulf have
been boiling along for millennia with or
without fossil fuels, but I think one can
make the good point that it's not absolutely
necessary to go there and lose them.)))</span></P>

<P>What if we could use fuels that are not expensive,
don't cause pollution and are abundantly available
right here at home?  <span class="bluetext">(((Then we'd probably
get whiplashed by Enron gaming the gas pipelines
while they still could.  They don't do that now
because Enron is dead.  We'll never be safe
while American oil majors are in power.)))</span></P>

<P>We have such fuels. Scientists have confirmed
that enough solar energy falls on the surface of
the earth every 40 minutes to meet 100 percent of
the entire world's energy needs for a full year.
Tapping just a small portion of this solar energy
could provide all of the electricity America uses.
<span class="bluetext">(((If somebody could store it.  I love solar,
but man, it sure is starting from a small
base.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((On the other hand, if Chinese Communists
can turn a blasted, overpopulated brain-dead
wasteland into a planetary megamall in a
generation, jeez, anything's possible.)))</span></P>

<P>And enough wind power blows through the Midwest
corridor every day to also meet 100 percent of
U.S. electricity demand. Geothermal energy,
similarly, is capable of providing enormous
supplies of electricity for America.</P>

<P>The quickest, cheapest and best way to start
using all this renewable energy is in the
production of electricity. In fact, we can
start right now using solar power, wind power
and geothermal power to make electricity for
our homes and businesses.  <span class="bluetext">(((I've had solar power
on my roof ever since Al's long-vanished
"Million Solar Roofs" initiative.  That's
paleolithic solar compared to the stuff that's
around now, but hey, it's been up there piping
fume-free voltage ever since.)))</span></P>

<P>But to make this exciting potential a reality,
and truly solve our nation's problems, we need
a new start.</P>

<P>That's why I'm proposing today a strategic
initiative designed to free us from the crises
that are holding us down and to regain control
of our own destiny. <span class="bluetext">(((I can't believe that
any nation-state is gonna control its destiny
when the global sky overhead is poisoned, but
Al's a nationalist and a patriot, so, what the
heck, at least he's doing more than whining
on his globalized email list.)))</span></P>

<P>It's not the only thing we need to do. But this
strategic challenge is the lynchpin of a bold
new strategy needed to re-power America.</P>

<P>Today I challenge our nation to commit to
producing 100 percent of our electricity from
renewable energy and truly clean carbon-free
sources within 10 years.   <span class="bluetext">(((Technical note
here: Al doesn't say that <STRONG>all</STRONG> American energy is
carbon-free &ndash; he says the <STRONG>electrical grid</STRONG>
becomes carbon-free.  This is plausible.
France's grid is 80 percent carbon free &ndash; because
it's nuclear.)))</span></P>


<P>This goal is achievable, affordable and
transformative. It represents a challenge to all
Americans &ndash; in every walk of life: to our
political leaders, entrepreneurs, innovators,
engineers, and to every citizen.  <span class="bluetext">(((Well,
if Kyoto internationalism won't do it, maybe
American nationalism will do it.  Failing that,
it'll be down to states, and also cities, and,
eventually, climate-refugee shanty camps
where they haul their broken solar power
panels along with their corrugated tin roofs.)))</span></P>

<P>A few years ago, it would not have been possible
to issue such a challenge. But here's what's
changed: the sharp cost reductions now beginning
to take place in solar, wind, and geothermal
power &ndash; coupled with the recent dramatic price
increases for oil and coal &ndash; have radically
changed the economics of energy.</P>

<P>When I first went to Congress 32 years ago,
<span class="bluetext">(((Al is old, and he's even become kind of wise)))</span>
I listened to experts testify that if oil ever got
to $35 a barrel, then renewable sources of energy
would become competitive. Well, today, the price
of oil is over $135 per barrel.  <span class="bluetext">(((So, you
can either make a massive change while you're
rich and it's easy, or else you can suffer
dreadfully and make a massive change while you
lose your homes, your currency and your children's
future.  Guess what choice Scarlett O'Hara took
in "Gone With the Wind," and you've got an
infallible guide to the strategic thinking of the
Bush Administration.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((The interesting part is that Al, who
is after all a Southerner from Tennessee,
has kinda got the Rhett Butler role in that
movie.  Too much a gentleman to duel!)))</span></P>

<P>And sure enough, billions of dollars of new
investment are flowing into the development
of concentrated solar thermal, photovoltaics,
windmills, geothermal plants, and a variety of
ingenious new ways to improve our efficiency
and conserve presently wasted energy.  <span class="bluetext">(((Too
bad that trillions are hastening toward
Dubai, Caracas and Moscow, but who knows, maybe
even the wretched among us who are damned by
the Curse of Oil will find some way, in time,
to redeem themselves.)))</span></P>

<P>And as the demand for renewable energy grows,
the costs will continue to fall. Let me give you
one revealing example: the price of the specialized
silicon used to make solar cells was recently as
high as $300 per kilogram. But the newest
contracts have prices as low as $50 a kilogram.</P>

<P>You know, the same thing happened with computer
chips &ndash; also made out of silicon. The price paid
for the same performance came down by 50 percent
every 18 months &ndash; year after year, and that's
what's happened for 40 years in a row.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((If solar had been following Moore's Law
then a megawatt ought to be literally cheaper
than sand right now, but, well, I do kind of find
it touching that Al would even try to explain
Moore's Law to the general voter.)))</span></P>

<P>To those who argue that we do not yet have the
technology to accomplish these results with
renewable energy: I ask them to come with me to
meet the entrepreneurs who will drive this
revolution. I've seen what they are doing
and I have no doubt that we can meet this challenge.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((The new American energy moguls.  The dot-
greenies.  Could they be any worse than oil sheiks,
Nigerians and Russians?  As a Viridian, I dare
to hope that they might have better aesthetic
taste than Moscow blingbling and Dubai skyscraper
fever.  Maybe this latest crop of Silicon Valley
zillionaires will flaunt their millions with
stuff like Ross Lovegrove "Tech Nouveau"
furniture.)))</span></P>

<P>To those who say the costs are still too high:
I ask them to consider whether the costs of oil
and coal will ever stop increasing if we keep
relying on quickly depleting energy sources to
feed a rapidly growing demand all around the world.
When demand for oil and coal increases, their price
goes up. When demand for solar cells increases,
the price often comes down.  <span class="bluetext">(((It's also rather
hard to blow up "solar pipelines.")))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((The weird part is that this autarchic
national-security argument would have made
so much more sense in the 1910s, the 1940s
or the 1960s than it does today.  For any
government anywhere to seize command-and-control
of its domestic energy grid would have been
a nothing-deal. It really shows how much capacity
to act has been lost through globalization.
The "Golden Straitjacket," as Thomas Friedman
used to put it &ndash; but if you fall overboard
in a straitjacket, man, you drown.)))</span></P>

<P>When we send money to foreign countries to buy
nearly 70 percent of the oil we use every day,
they build new skyscrapers and we lose jobs.
When we spend that money building solar arrays
and windmills, we build competitive industries
and gain jobs here at home.  <span class="bluetext">(((I wonder
if Al thinks he has a "job."  A "job" with
what?  With health insurance, with guaranteed
long-term employment?  Do workers in China
and India have any "jobs"?  No, and that's why
they get hired, I reckon.)))</span></P>

<P>Of course there are those who will tell us this
can't be done. Some of the voices we hear are
the defenders of the status quo &ndash; the ones with
a vested interest in perpetuating the current
system, no matter how high a price the rest of
us will have to pay. <span class="bluetext">(((Yeah, and thanks a lot,
fellas.  See you in The Hague.)))</span></P>

<P>But even those who reap the profits of the carbon
age have to recognize the inevitability of its
demise. As one OPEC oil minister observed,
"The Stone Age didn't end because of a shortage
of stones."  <span class="bluetext">(((That's a funny thing to say,
but clearly the Oil Age is ending because of
shortages of oil.  If somebody somehow found
a Saudi Arabia of oil in the thawing Arctic
we'd clearly be back to square one.)))</span></P>

<P>To those who say 10 years is not enough time,
I respectfully ask them to consider what the
world's scientists are telling us about the
risks we face if we don't act in 10 years. The
leading experts predict that we have less than
10 years to make dramatic changes in our global
warming pollution lest we lose our ability to
ever recover from this environmental crisis.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((I find the idea that we could somehow
factually "recover" from the Greenhouse
Effect to be amazing.  It's almost as farfetched
as the peaceful downfall of Communism, but,
what the heck; if our insight failed us
and the climate problem is much worse than we
imagined, maybe the solution is similarly easier
than we fear.  We pretty much gotta try
something, and, as Ralph Waldo Emerson once
thundered, "God will not have his work made
manifest by cowards." )))</span></P>

<P>When the use of oil and coal goes up, pollution
goes up. When the use of solar, wind and geothermal
increases, pollution comes down.</P>

<P>To those who say the challenge is not politically
viable: I suggest they go before the American
people and try to defend the status quo. <span class="bluetext">(((Yeah &ndash;
at least the Americans, even the Red Staters,
and finally and truly really good and sick.
It's gonna take a truly degraded American populace
to kneel and lick the cold vomit of the neocons
off the pavement in November.)))</span>  Then bear witness
to the people's appetite for change.</P>

<P>I for one do not believe our country can withstand
10 more years of the status quo. Our families cannot
stand 10 more years of gas price increases. Our
workers cannot stand 10 more years of job losses
and outsourcing of factories. Our economy cannot
stand 10 more years of sending $2 billion every 24
hours to foreign countries for oil. And our soldiers
and their families cannot take another 10 years of
repeated troop deployments to dangerous regions that
just happen to have large oil supplies.   <span class="bluetext">(((Yep &ndash;
the next politician with a plan this ambitious is
gonna have to cook up a Marshall Plan for a defeated
USA.  I can dare to hope the USA gets more
coherent help than the collapsed former USSR did.)))</span></P>

<P>What could we do instead for the next 10 years?
What should we do during the next 10 years?
Some of our greatest accomplishments as a nation
have resulted from commitments to reach a goal that
fell well beyond the next election: the Marshall
Plan, Social Security, the interstate highway system.
But a political promise to do something in ten years
is about the maximum time that we as a nation can
hold a steady aim and hit our target. <span class="bluetext">(((That means
that, for any kind of trouble longer than a ten-year
time frame, nation-states are useless.  Clearly
we need more capable frameworks for long-term
action on long-term threats.  "The Outquisition,"
anyone?)))</span></P>

<P>When President John F. Kennedy challenged our nation
to land a man on the moon and bring him back safely
in 10 years, many people doubted we could accomplish
that goal. But 8 years and 2 months later, Neil
Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin walked on the surface of
the moon.  <span class="bluetext">(((I can hope that defeating a climate
catastrophe is rather more solemn and important than
this particular piece of Nixonian street-theater.
Except for its usefulness in humiliating the Soviets,
the long-term benefits of a manned moon landing
were negligible.  Which is why we don't do them
any more.  National energy grids, by stark contrast,
are entities one shouldn't merely trifle with.)))</span></P>

<P>To be sure, reaching the goal of 100 percent renewable
and truly clean electricity within 10 years will
require us to overcome many obstacles.   <span class="bluetext">(((It'll
come a lot easier if the paralytic USA has to watch
Danes and Germans, or maybe even Chicagoans and
San Franciscans, doing it with serenity.  The
Europeans can't  afford ten years of paying Arabs
either, by the way.  Neither can the Chinese or
Indians, who've both had severe stock-market
setbacks lately.)))</span></P>

<P>At present, for example, we do not have a unified
national grid that is sufficiently advanced to link
the areas where the sun shines and the wind blows
to the cities in the East and the West that need
the electricity.</P>

<P>Our national electric grid is critical infrastructure,
as vital to the health and security of our economy
as our highways  <span class="bluetext">(((crumbling)))</span> and telecommunication
networks  <span class="bluetext">(((yanked from the inventive hands of Al
Gore and handed to a sinister and exploitative duopoly
who spy on you for the Bush Administration)))</span>.</P>

<P>Today, our grids are antiquated, fragile, and
vulnerable to cascading failure. Power outages and
defects in the current grid system cost U.S. businesses
more than $120 billion dollars a year. It has to be
upgraded anyway.</P>


<P>We could further increase the value and efficiency of
a Unified National Grid by helping our struggling auto
giants switch to the manufacture of plug-in electric
cars. An electric vehicle fleet would sharply reduce
the cost of driving a car, reduce pollution, and
increase the flexibility of our electricity grid.</P>

<P>At the same time, of course, we need to greatly
improve our commitment to efficiency and conservation.
That's the best investment we can make.  <span class="bluetext">(((Nobody
is ever gonna "conserve more energy" than a dead guy,
which is why, as a Viridian, I don't believe this
in fact our best investment.)))</span></P>

<P>America's transition to renewable energy sources
must also include adequate provisions to assist
those Americans who would unfairly face hardship.
For example, we must recognize those who have toiled
in dangerous conditions to bring us our present
energy supply. <span class="bluetext">(((Yeah, thanks, oil-stained
Third Worlders, oppressed by autocrats and blown
apart by terrorists...)))</span></P>

<P>We should guarantee good jobs in the
fresh air and sunshine for any coal miner displaced
by impacts on the coal industry. Every single one of them.
<span class="bluetext">(((Oh wait &ndash; Al means American guys
digging up American energy.  They're, what,
thirty percent of that effort?  Anyone who's ever
heard a Loretta Lynn record oughta know what kind
of deal American coal-miners get from life.)))</span></P>

<P>Of course, we could and should speed up this
transition by insisting that the price of
carbon-based energy include the costs of the
environmental damage it causes. <span class="bluetext">(((Which is
basically infinite.  Have you priced a molten
pole lately?)))</span></P>

<P>I have long supported a sharp reduction in payroll
taxes with the difference made up in CO2 taxes.
We should tax what we burn, not what we earn.
<span class="bluetext">(((That oughta be thrilling news for moguls,
especially solar and wind moguls, who would
get to live tax-free.)))</span></P>

<P>This is the single most important policy change we
can make.   <span class="bluetext">(((Okay, give me my money back and
I'll cheerily buy the green energy &ndash;- because
I've been doing it for years!)))</span></P>

<P>In order to foster international cooperation, it is
also essential that the United States rejoin the
global community  <span class="bluetext">(((what's left of it... let's see,
there's Europe, there's some kind of weird Sarkozy
"Mediterranean Basin" thing and there's a bunch of
dusty for a where weary, graying diplomats wait for
the  Americans to show up and blow up and shred things,
John Bolton style)))</span> and lead efforts to secure an
international treaty at Copenhagen in December of next
year that includes a cap on CO2 emissions and a global
partnership that recognizes the necessity of addressing
the threats of extreme poverty and disease as part of
the world's agenda for solving the climate crisis.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((The treaty might conceivably be of some use,
but who's gonna enforce it?  Also, while constructing
a grid is doable, our old pals poverty and disease
are firmly in the saddle in a world where food costs
are rocketing and ecosystems are poisoned.  The
idea of the corps diplomatique tackling this is
about as likely as it's being solved by inky,
unread newspaper editorials.)))</span></P>

<P>Of course the greatest obstacle to meeting the
challenge of 100 percent renewable electricity in
10 years may be the deep dysfunction of our politics
and our self-governing system as it exists today.
<span class="bluetext">(((At least he's got the guts to say it &ndash; that
must sting after 30+ years of public service.)))</span></P>

<P>In recent years, our politics has tended toward
incremental proposals made up of small policies
designed to avoid offending special interests,
alternating with occasional baby steps in the right
direction. Our democracy has become sclerotic at a
time when these crises require boldness.  <span class="bluetext">(((Yes.)))</span></P>

<P>It is only a truly dysfunctional system that
would buy into the perverse logic that the short-term
answer to high gasoline prices is drilling for more
oil ten years from now.  <span class="bluetext">(((Yes.  Actually, if
there was a national federal crash-drilling program,
run by the able likes of the Homeland Security
Department as a pressing matter of national survival,
that would likely stop the drilling entirely.)))</span></P>

<P>Am I the only one who finds it strange that our
government so often adopts a so-called solution
that has absolutely nothing to do with the problem
it is supposed to address?  <span class="bluetext">(((No.  "Clean Skies
Program, "War on Terror," I could go on...)))</span></P>

<P>When people rightly complain about higher gasoline
prices, we propose to give more money to the oil
companies and pretend that they're going to bring
gasoline prices down. It will do nothing of the sort,
and everyone knows it.  <span class="bluetext">(((Yes they do.  The tower of
lies here... how high do they tower?  They tower
about 147 dollars high, at the moment.)))</span></P>

<P>If we keep going back to the same policies that have
never ever worked in the past and have served only
to produce the highest gasoline prices in history
alongside the greatest oil company profits in history,
nobody should be surprised if we get the same result
over and over again.</P>

<P>But the Congress may be poised to move in that
direction anyway because some of them are being
stampeded by lobbyists for special interests that
know how to make the system work for them instead
of the American people.   <span class="bluetext">(((Bow to the masters of
the pump.  Actually, quite a lot of Americans <STRONG>are</STRONG>
in oil companies, and they're doing great by the
distress of the rest of us.  Houston hasn't boomed
like this in years.  I might forgive 'em this if
Houston hadn't already drowned once in a major
Greenhouse flood.)))</span></P>

<P>If you want to know the truth about gasoline prices,
here it is: the exploding demand for oil, especially
in places like China, is overwhelming the rate of
new discoveries by so much that oil prices are
almost certain to continue upward over time no
matter what the oil companies promise. And
politicians cannot bring gasoline prices down
in the short term.</P>

<P>However, there actually is one extremely effective
way to bring the costs of driving a car way down
within a few short years. The way to bring gas
prices down is to end our dependence on oil and
use the renewable sources that can give us the
equivalent of $1 per gallon gasoline.  <span class="bluetext">(((Go for
it, Vinod Khosla.  Glad you were able to immigrate
to USA before a million guys with odd names ended
up on no-fly lists.)))</span></P>

<P>Many Americans have begun to wonder whether or not
we've simply lost our appetite for bold policy
solutions.  <span class="bluetext">(((It's not a matter of "appetite" &ndash;
they privatized the dining table and sold off the
knives and forks.  And those napkins?  All Chinese.)))</span></P>

<P>And folks who claim to know how our system works
these days have told us we might as well forget
about our political system doing anything bold,
especially if it is contrary to the wishes of
special interests. And I've got to admit, that
sure seems to be the way things have been going.</P>

<P>But I've begun to hear different voices in this
country from people who are not only tired of baby
steps and special interest politics, but are hungry
for a new, different and bold approach.  <span class="bluetext">(((Because
they're the new special interests.  And not a
day too soon, boys.)))</span></P>

<P>We are on the eve of a presidential election. We are
in the midst of an international climate treaty process
that will conclude its work before the end of the first
year of the new president's term. It is a great error
to say that the United States must wait for others to
join us in this matter. In fact, we must move first,
because that is the key to getting others to follow;
and because moving first is in our own national
interest.  <span class="bluetext">(((Plus, scenting American blood in
the water, the currency sharks are circling, and
we're looking at the raw potential for the biggest
shock-economy looting spree since Yeltsin sold
Russia to seven moguls.)))</span></P>

<P>So I ask you to join with me to call on every
candidate, at every level, to accept this challenge &ndash;
for America to be running on 100 percent zero-carbon
electricity in 10 years. It's time for us to move
beyond empty rhetoric. We need to act now.</P>

<P>This is a generational moment. A moment when we decide
our own path and our collective fate. I'm asking you
&ndash; each of you &ndash; to join me and build this future.
Please join the WE campaign at wecansolveit.org.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((It kills me that this whole plea is aimed squarely
at a website. It's some kind of Viridian apotheosis,
really.  All of this, and he wants us to go click
on a website?  Well, you know &ndash; maybe that's how
it's done, nowadays.)))</span></P>

<P>We need you. And we need you now. We're committed to
changing not just light bulbs, but laws. And laws will
only change with leadership. <span class="bluetext">(((Or collapse.)))</span></P>

<P>On July 16, 1969, the United States of America was
finally ready to meet President Kennedy's challenge
of landing Americans on the moon. I will never forget
standing beside my father <span class="bluetext">(((the major mover in the
Internet Highway System, and Al has never gotten over
than any more than Bush II can resist trumping his
father's "prudence")))</span> a few miles from the launch
site, waiting for the giant Saturn 5 rocket to lift
Apollo 11 into the sky. I was a young man, 21 years
old, who had graduated from college a month before
and was enlisting in the United States Army three
weeks later.</P>

<P>I will never forget the inspiration of those minutes.
The power and the vibration of the giant rocket's
engines shook my entire body. As I watched the rocket
rise, slowly at first and then with great speed <span class="bluetext">(((and
powered by fossil fuels)))</span>, the sound was deafening.</P>

<P>We craned our necks to follow its path until we
were looking straight up into the air. And then four
days later, I watched along with hundreds of millions
of others around the world as Neil Armstrong took one
small step to the surface of the moon and changed the
history of the human race.  <span class="bluetext">(((Sorta.)))</span></P>

<P>We must now lift our nation to reach another goal that
will change history. Our entire civilization depends
upon us now embarking on a new journey of exploration
and discovery. Our success depends on our willingness
as a people to undertake this journey and to complete
it within 10 years. Once again, we have an opportunity
to take a giant leap for humankind.</P>

this.  Green energy isn't a moon race, and, given
their huge head start, Europeans ought to be able to
leave the US in the dust. Of course, the Europeans,
who to their post-governmental dismay don't even
have a Constitution, may be even more politically
sclerotic than the Americans but... come on!
Even the Soviet Union had an honest shot at the
Moon &ndash; once.  They failed, and they're gone.
