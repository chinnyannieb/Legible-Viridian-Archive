aware that global warming exists.  Luntz just doesn't

<P>We can rebuild the planet's energy systems.  That's
hard. It means taxing the hell out of skywrecking

economy with climate shocks and killing off some hefty
percentage of the planet's consumers.

<h2>Can America go green?</h2>
<P>Cover story by Elizabeth Kolbert<br>
Monday 19th June 2006</P>

<P>"Why are Americans so sceptical about global warming?
Possibly because they really don't want to do anything about it,
argues Elizabeth Kolbert</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Or, possibly the Americans don't want to "go green"
in any way that requires approval from the likes of
"New Statesman."  For instance, Americans are doing
plenty "about" climate change as they panic this storm
season.  They're just not global in sentiment or global
government-centric.  It may be that Americans will
come to believe in "national warming" with a
private-enterprise climate-change industry.)))</span></P>

<P>"In <STRONG>An Inconvenient Truth,</STRONG> perhaps the world's
first film based on a PowerPoint presentation,
<span class="bluetext">(((judging by most Hollywood product, surely not)))</span>
Al Gore plays himself: a sometimes brooding,
sometimes funny ex-politician come to deliver a
message about 'a planetary emergency'.</P>

<P>"He gives an impressive performance, one that
the American press == a group that never before
seemed terribly sympathetic to the former vice-
president == has greeted with almost universal
enthusiasm. (In two fairly representative examples:
the New York Times described Gore as "the surprisingly
engaging vehicle for some very disturbing information",
while USA Today called the documentary a showcase for
his "dedication, warmth and, yes, charm".)</P>

<P>"An Inconvenient Truth has prompted a great deal
of discussion in the United States about what might
have happened had Gore revealed a few more of the
qualities of his on-screen persona while out
campaigning in 2000, and even more speculation about
whether he is preparing to run again in 2008.</P>

<P>"Perhaps not surprisingly, the strongest claims
about the film's reception have come from the star
himself. Speaking last month on the popular public
radio show Fresh Air, Gore said that recent events had
made him 'optimistic' that American attitudes towards
global warming were finally changing. The US political
system, he further observed, 'shares one thing in
common with the climate system. It's non-linear.
It can appear to move at a glacier's pace and then,
after crossing a tipping point, it can suddenly move
rapidly into a completely new pattern. I've seen that
happen.'</P>

<P>"Certainly, there are few questions more urgent
than how == and how quickly == the US will react to
climate change.   As is well known, Americans represent
less than 5 per cent of the world's population, and
yet they produce roughly 25 per cent of its carbon-
dioxide emissions.  <span class="bluetext">(((In other words, even if
Americans magically vaporize to the last man, woman,
and overfed child, the climate is still in deep
trouble.)))</span>  The country is one of only two
industrialised nations that has rejected the Kyoto
Protocol and, with it, mandatory emissions cuts.
(The other is Australia.)  <span class="bluetext">(((And don't forget those
new right-wingers running Canada, the Maple Leaf
State.)))</span></P>

<P>"Even as European leaders are pushing for
negotiations to begin on a post-Kyoto treaty, the
US has refused to participate. And on and on.
<span class="bluetext">(((The Americans don't do multilateral "treaties"
about anything any more.  Have you noticed the WTO,
always considered the primary tool of the Washington
Consensus, is collapsing?  <strong>Not only is America not
running the world, nobody is.</strong>)))</span>  At this point,
it is almost impossible to imagine how the world
will avoid disastrous climate impacts without a
fundamental, and prompt, change in US policy.</P>


<P><span class="bluetext">(((I can imagine it.  Somebody discovers cold fusion.
The fossil-fuel biz would collapse from the sheer
number of shots already being fired at it.  Or, I can
imagine a summit of the G-17 where America is simply
delivered an ultimatum: quit wrecking the planet, or
we declare you an outlaw state, indict your leaders
and launch economic embargos.   The USA is only five
percent of the population: if they became the new
Serbia or South Africa, they would totally panic.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((But never mind those "unimaginable" scenarios.
Consider the "unthinkable" one: the glaring likelihood
of a reeling, comprehensive collapse in global
governance DURING and AFTER the "disastrous climate
impacts."  New Orleans already had a "disastrous
climate impact."  New Orleans is still there.
More or less.  If global governance fails, then we
get a "failed globe." Living in a failed glove is
pretty much like living in a failed state, only the
problem's much, much bigger.)))</span></P>

<P>"Gore's professed optimism that such a change
is at hand, which is shared, at least for the purposes
of public consumption,  <span class="bluetext">(((come on, Elizabeth, tell
us what they really think, we're all grownups here)))</span>
by many of the country's leading environmentalists,
<span class="bluetext">(((the "retreating environmentalists")))</span> rests on
what might be called the democratic (with a small "d")
imperative. <span class="bluetext">(((Well "democracy" sure worked for Iraq!
Hoo-ah!)))</span></P>

<P>"As Gore points out, accurately enough, companies
such as ExxonMobil and General Motors, working in
concert with right-wing think-tanks such as the George
C Marshall Institute, have spent millions of dollars
trying systematically to obscure the facts. (Indeed,
as if on cue, the Competitive Enterprise Institute
greeted the premiere of Gore's movie with a pair of
60-second TV ads full of jumping gazelles and kids
skipping rope, carrying the tag line: <strong>"Carbon dioxide:
they call it pollution; we call it life."</strong>) Add to
this an American press corps axiomatically devoted
to the notion of "balance", and the result has been
confusion. But as soon as Americans understand "the
inconvenient truth" about climate change, Gore has
asserted, they'll do the right thing. <span class="bluetext">((("Carbon
dioxide: they called it pollution, and we got life
in prison for creating disastrous climate impacts."
<STRONG>That</STRONG> would be Americans "doing the right thing.")))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((This also elides the fact that the federal
government itself has spent millions of dollars trying
systematically to obscure the facts.  The American
government is not in opposition to capitalist
"companies." The American political elite consists
almost entirely of people from "companies."  When the
Vice President is closeted with Exxon and Enron, he's
speaking directly to his colleagues.)))</span></P>

<P>"Making generalisations about an entire nation is
always a dubious enterprise,  <span class="bluetext">(((oh come on, go right
ahead)))</span> and this is especially true of the US. The
modern environmental movement was born in America and
enjoyed its first successes there. Even under George W
Bush == perhaps the most polluter-friendly president
in the nation's history == the country still spends
more money than any other on environmental science;
as the president likes to boast, this year alone,
the federal government will spend roughly $2bn on
climate research and monitoring. <span class="bluetext">(((I wonder why nobody
ever points out how much pollution the federal
government itself emits.  It's like the federal
government exists on some Hegelian plane of abstraction
where nobody has fossil-fueled armies and navies.)))</span></P>

<P>"Britain's Met Office has the Hadley Centre: the
US supports three climate modelling teams == one at
Nasa, the second at the National Oceanic and
Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and the third at
the National Centre for Atmospheric Research (NCAR).
<span class="bluetext">(((Let's take bets on which of these climate-watching
enterprises will be the first one smashed by a
"megacat" disastrous climate impact.  Are any of them
sited anywhere near sea level?)))</span></P>

<P>"All around the country there are towns and
cities and state governments that are actively working
to reduce their emissions in spite of == or perhaps
one should say because of == federal inaction.
<span class="bluetext">(((Even if the Kyoto Accords passed tomorrow, who
would enforce them?  Halliburton?  Blackwater?
It isn't a matter of the federal government coming
to its senses, it's a matter of whether there will
be an enterprise that fits that description of a
government.)))</span></P>

<P>"In February 2005 the mayor of Seattle, Greg Nickels,
<span class="bluetext">(((should be President, but he'd probably get less
useful done)))</span> began to circulate the "US Mayors
Climate Protection Agreement", which calls on cities
to "strive to meet or beat the Kyoto Protocol targets
in their own communities"; as of this month, 243
mayors, representing communities as diverse as Miami,
<span class="bluetext">(((megacat target)))</span> Racine in Wisconsin and
Charleston, South Carolina, <span class="bluetext">(((megacat target)))</span> had
signed on. <span class="bluetext">(((US mayors are getting together to look
Kyoto-friendly; that may look better politically to
politicians offshore, but it's not going to avert
disastrous climate change, because that's already
happening.)))</span></P>

<P>"New York, New Jersey and several other north-eastern
states have pledged to freeze their power-plant
emissions at current levels and, eventually, to begin
to roll them back. Even Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger,
the Hummer collector,  <span class="bluetext">(((at least they've stopped
calling this weird guy "the Austrian bodybuilder")))</span>
has joined in the effort: an executive order he signed
last year  calls on California to reduce its
greenhouse-gas emissions to 2000 levels by 2010 and
to 1990 levels by 2020. 'I say the debate is over,'
Schwarzenegger declared before signing the order.
'We know the science. We see the threat. And we know
the time for action is now.' The California Public
Utilities Commission recently launched a $2.9bn
rebate programme aimed at installing solar-power
arrays on one million rooftops. <span class="bluetext">(((They're outdoing
Al Gore's "Million Solar Roofs Initiative" all by
their little Californian selves.)))</span></P>

<P>"Ballooning house sizes</P>

<P>"If you focus on efforts such as these, it's tempting
to conclude that the US is ready to shift course and,
indeed, to some extent is already doing so. Look
elsewhere, however, and it's far less clear. Consider
what has happened to the average new home built in the
country. Even as average household size has declined,
the size of the average house has ballooned. <span class="bluetext">(((Lonely
people need more toys.)))</span></P>

<P>"It was 1,000 square feet in 1950 and is nearly 2,500
square feet to-day. New homes, meanwhile, now routinely
feature a gamut of energy-intensive conveniences, such
as outdoor kitchens, professional-sized appliances and
heated towel racks.  <span class="bluetext">((("Heated towel-racks," how dare
they, oh the humanity.)))</span></P>

<P>"Or consider what has happened to the American
automobile.  <span class="bluetext">(((They stopped selling.)))</span>  At the same
time Americans were being presented with ever more
compelling evidence of global climate change, they
were also, in ever greater numbers, purchasing cars
like GM's Yukon Denali, which has a 335-horsepower
engine, weighs 7,000lb, comes equipped with heated
leather seats, <span class="bluetext">(((boo!)))</span> and gets 13 miles to the
gallon.</P>

<P>"On  average, passenger vehicles purchased in the
US last  year got 21.0 miles to the gallon; this was
a worse gas mileage than the average passenger vehicle
got 20 years earlier. <span class="bluetext">(((As an interesting sidelight,
the British SUV is fondly known as the "Chelsea
Tractor.")))</span></P>

<P>"In many parts of the country George Bush's
recalcitrance isn't representative, but in others
his equivocations look positively progressive:
Senator James Inhofe, Republican of Oklahoma, who
chairs the Senate committee on environment and
public works, has famously called global warming
the "greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American
people". <span class="bluetext">((("National warming."  The hoax perpetrated
on the 95% of the planet that isn't American simply
doesn't matter to Inhofe.)))</span></P>

<P>"Every year Senator John McCain, the Republican
Party's most vocal proponent of action on climate
change, brings to the floor a bill that would impose
federal limits on CO2 emissions. Every year it's a
foregone conclusion that the bill will be defeated.
<span class="bluetext">(((Because it's McCain's bill.)))</span> It is worth noting
that all the way back in 1992, Gore published a book,
Earth in the Balance, which eloquently laid out the
dangers of global warming.  <span class="bluetext">(((I read it.)))</span> The book
became a bestseller. Gore became the vice-president.
And still nothing happened. <span class="bluetext">(((All kinds of things
happened, just nothing that this commentator considers
progressive.  On the plus side, it's kind of nice to
see a British article about climate change that doesn't
ritually lambaste BP, whose green corporate climate-
change propaganda is literally drenching the UK.
The same for Shell, DuPont, GE... they are WAY ahead
of the politicals.)))</span></P>

<P>"Are such patterns really the result of disinformation?
Do Americans drive around in 7,000lb cars because
somehow they missed the many thousands of news stories
and scientific studies documenting record high
temperatures, rising sea levels and shrinking ice caps?
As an American, I'd like to believe this is so. But
it's hard to. <span class="bluetext">(((As an American, you ought to be able
to believe in inerrant Biblical prophesy and
creationism, because that's the creed of the politically dominant
electoral clique.  So maybe you should ease up a little
on the knowing incredulity there.  They needed that 7,000lb
SUV to take the kids to Bible-study class.)))</span></P>

<P>"Life in the United States, more than just about
anywhere else save perhaps some of the oil-producing
Gulf states, depends on cheap and plentiful energy.
<span class="bluetext">(((EVERYBODY WITHOUT EXCEPTION depends on cheap and
plentiful energy, because otherwise, when they starve
at subsistence-level, nobody flies in with fossil-
fueled choppers to hand them fossil-fueled food.
And you shoulda seen the mayhem this winter when
the Russians and Chechnyans started shutting off gas
pipelines.  The southern USA doesn't spend every
winter in 15 feet of freezing snow.)))</span></P>

<P>"This is a fact of American culture and also of the
American economy. Really addressing the problem of
climate change will require many small-scale
adjustments (no more heated towel racks)  <span class="bluetext">(((I
predict that heated towel racks will surge in
popularity if banned)))</span> and also a great many more
substantial ones: changes in energy consumption,
energy production, patterns of land use, transportation
systems, international relations. <span class="bluetext">(((This list of
"actions" is so vague as to be meaningless.I'm starting
to think that the real crux of the matter is sucking
the carbon-dioxide out of the sky.  There may already
be too much CO2 up there for civilization to survive.
Fighting the greenhouse has to mean redressing the
damage, and it may well be that the only way out
of a "tipping point" is the artificial creation of
some "tipping-back point.")))</span></P>

<P>"Rather than assume that Americans haven't done
anything about global warming because they are
sceptical about the threat, one could just as plausibly
argue that they are sceptical about the threat because
they don't want to do anything.  <span class="bluetext">(((If American's
didn't want to do anything, they wouldn't be
workaholics busting every sinew to buy those huge
houses and cars.  They just don't want to do
vague and ludicrous hairshirt-Green things, and
neither does anybody else.  Even hairshirt-Greens do
hairshirt Green things for the sake of the hairshirt,
not for the green-ness.  If you had a solar-powered
heated towel-rack, you'd still get a scolding from
the hairshirt contingent because your warm, toasty
flesh is insufficiently mortified.)))</span></P>

<P>"Shortly after Gore was elected vice-president, he
proposed a tax on energy == specifically on the
energy content of fossil fuels. It was defeated
ignominiously, even though the Democrats still
controlled Congress. Gore never raised the prospect
of an energy tax again. Four years later he flew to
Japan to salvage the Kyoto Protocol when negotiations
seemed on the verge of breaking down. The Clinton
administration eventually signed the protocol but
never presented it to the Senate for ratification.
Though Gore knew that the very future of the planet
was at stake, he apparently concluded that pressing
for action was hopeless, or politically inexpedient,
or both. Talk about an inconvenient truth.
<span class="bluetext">(((What would you do if you concluded that a political
solution to climate change was hopeless and
politically inexpedient?  Well, whatever that course
of action is, stop scolding Al Gore and just go do
that right now.)))</span></P>

<P>"Beyond the tipping point</P>


<P>"At this point, midterm elections in the US are just
five months away. Recent polls suggest that control
of both houses of Congress is up for grabs. It's
possible that the Democrats will win a majority in
at least one, in which case the chairmanships of
certain important committees will shift to less
openly anti-science members. <span class="bluetext">(((For the time being.
Being openly anti-science is kinda the coming thing
worldwide; ask any Moslem.)))</span></P>

<P>"On the other hand, it is also possible that the
Republicans will retain their majorities, in which
case they are likely to interpret the results as a
mandate for staying the course. Two years from now
is a presidential election. Among the current leading
contenders are some of the most passionate advocates
of action == Gore and McCain == and also some of the
leading obstructionists, such as Senator Chuck Hagel,
Republican of Nebraska. (Hagel was among the chief
opponents of Kyoto.) Whoever wins in 2008 will face
an American public that still expects the government
to respond to rising energy prices by cutting gasoline
taxes. <span class="bluetext">(((Unless energy prices have gone into complete
Global-War-On-Terror Peak Oil insanity by 2008, which
would seem to me to be at least a lively prospect,
especially given that Russia, Venezuela, Iran and
the Saudis are sitting on the  taps.)))</span></P>

<P>"Such is the inexorable nature of global warming that,
at some point or other, even the US will be forced to
acknowledge the scale of the problem. As McCain has
observed: "'his is clearly an issue that we will win
on over time because of the evidence.'  <span class="bluetext">(((Maybe.
Evolution is pretty inexorable too, and the guys who
deny it have faithful voters.)))</span> The tragedy is: we
don't have more time. The earth's climate system is
vast and hugely inertial, and so already we are much
further along the path to catastrophe than it appears.
The rapid melting of mountain glaciers, the
accelerating flow off the Greenland ice sheet, the
2003 heatwave in Europe, the 2005 hurricane season
in the US == these are just the first faint harbingers
of changes that have, by now, already become
inevitable.</P>

<P>"If we continue on our present course, at a certain
point, truly terrible climatic disasters == the
disintegration of the Greenland or the West Antarctic
ice sheet, for instance == will become similarly
unavoidable. These disasters may take centuries to
play out fully, but once the process begins, it
will become self-reinforcing and therefore virtually
impossible to stop. This "tipping point" could be
reached 20 years from now, or ten years from now, or,
if truth be told, it could have already been reached
ten years ago. Of course the US can go green. The
question is: will it do so before it is too late?"</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((I note that James Lovelock, who concluded in despair
that the planet's population would end up as ragged
Mad Max barbarians clustered at the poles, recently
changed his stance to suggest that we ought to be
planning a "polar civilization." We're not literally
running out of time; we may be spending centuries
dealing with the huge and evil consequences of the past 200 years.</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((With the best  political will in the world, there
isn't time for a political solution to global climate
change.  As Bush should have learned in New Orleans and
probably didn't, it's gonna be the climate change
shaping the politics from now on, not vice versa.
Politics and climate change don't have that much to
do with one another: there are no ballotboxes in the
clouds. Nobody ever voted to have climate change.
There isn't a single nation on the planet, including
the Americans, who favors climate change.  There is
no pro-climate-change political party anywhere.
Plus, the Washington Consensus is over. It'll likely
take a generation before anybody on the planet is any
mood to do anything Americans say about anything.</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((The real need is pretty simple: we've gotta stop
burning stuff.  Thinking that President Al will save
our bacon after negotiating Kyoto II: that is the
figment of a lost epoch.  If that approach was
ever gonna work, it's not gonna work now that the
bacon's visibly smoking in the pan.)))</span></P>
