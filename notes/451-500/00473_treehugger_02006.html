<P>"The world's greatest green inventions</P>

<P>"We all want the latest cars, the grooviest clothes
and the shiniest gadgets. <span class="bluetext">(((You bet!)))</span> But what
of the price to the planet? Is it possible to go
shopping with a  clear conscience? Can environmentally
sound products still be objects of  desire?
The cutting-edge environmental website treehugger.com
thinks so. <span class="bluetext">(((And they're dead right, too!)))</span>
Here, its editor, Michael Richard, shows Josh Sims
how a new breed of  inventors is coming up with the
goods == and they don't cost the earth.</P>

<P>"04 September 2006</P>

<A NAME="_the_eco_kettle"> </a><br />
<H2>"THE ECO KETTLE</H2>

<P>"It is estimated that, on average, we boil twice
the volume of water needed  every time we use our
kettles. With a 3kW kettle that's the same as wasting
the energy of around 50 light bulbs. And standard
kettles are often highly  inefficient == a stove-top
kettle, for instance, requires energy to heat the
handle and shell in addition to the water. But
British designer Brian  Hartley's Eco Kettle solves
these problems at a stroke. You fill it up, and
then use the measuring button to release the exact
amount of water you  require == from a single cup to
a full jug == into a separate chamber for  boiling.
It is also insulated to keep the water hot. The
result is an energy  saving of up to 30 per cent.

<P><span class="bluetext">(((And thanks to climate change, soon they'll be able
to GROW TEA in tropical Britain instead of flying
it in from Ceylon!)))</span></P>

<A NAME="_green_roofs"> </a><br />
<H2>"GREEN ROOFS</H2>

<P>"Cities may be losing their green spaces to
development, but all is not lost.  Look up to the
roofs of buildings, especially office blocks, and
there,  where once there was dead space, you could
now find a 'sky garden'  (Barclays' HQ in Canary
Wharf, London, has one).</P>

<P>"They could be used as  community spaces, chill-out
areas for hassled workers, or even to grow food.
But there are other advantages for the bottom line, too:
they reduce run-off in periods of heavy rain,
and they cut back on the heat that gets trapped in
built-up areas, thus reducing the need for air
conditioning. They could even  improve air quality
in congested cities.<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.greenroofs.com">http://www.greenroofs.com</a><br /></P>

<P><BR>
<span class="bluetext">(((Plus, after the Peak Oil Apocalypse, sky gardens
on top of abandoned skyscrapers would make great
sets for post-disaster thrillers!)))</span></P>

<A NAME="_frictionless_wind_turbines"> </a><br />
<H2>"FRICTIONLESS WIND TURBINES</H2>

<P>"The problem with wind turbines? Often, it's just
not windy enough to get  them turning. It's not
really the lack of wind that is the problem, but the
friction in the turbines themselves.</P>

<P>"Chinese scientists may have cracked  this problem
with the first 'magnetic levitation' (or MagLev)
wind turbines,  which replace ball-bearings with
the technology used in advanced monorails,
making a frictionless turbine that can generate
electricity from winds as  low as 1.5m per second.
They're ideal for low wind areas, such as mountain
regions and small islands. The MagLev wind turbines
could also use the  airflow caused by passing cars
to generate roadside lighting.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((It might even generate power from foreigners
wringing their hands over Chinese environmentalism!)))</span></P>

<A NAME="_solar-powered_cellphones"> </a><br />
<H2>"SOLAR-POWERED CELLPHONES</H2>

<P>"Germany's Fraunhofer Institute, an alliance of 50
technology research  organisations, is looking at how
to integrate solar cells into mobile phones, allowing
them to be powered continuously on just two hours of
sunlight a day. The big manufacturers are interested,
as the more software that's packed into mobiles, the
bigger batteries they need.<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.fraunhofer.de">http://www.fraunhofer.de</a><br /></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Yeah, and all you have to do is leave your cellie
on the windowsill like a freshly-baked pie!)))</span></P>

<A NAME="_ice_energy"> </a><br />
<H2>"ICE ENERGY</H2>

<P>"Air conditioning can be a huge drain on electricity
supplies. Enter Ice Energy's Ice Bear, which integrates
with a standard AC unit. The water in the Ice Bear is
frozen overnight when temperatures are lower and
electricity, in many countries, is cheaper, and the
ice then cools the AC unit's refridgerant during the
day. This results in a 30 per cent saving in  energy
use. An AC unit should last 15 years, by which time
the Ice Bear will have paid for itself several times.
<A HREF="http://www.ice-energy.com">http://www.ice-energy.com</a><br /></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Might even save actual ice bears from drowning
in the molten Arctic!)))</span></P>

<A NAME="_greener_aircraft"> </a><br />
<H2>"GREENER AIRCRAFT</H2>

<P>"Conventional airliners are heavy, thirsty, noisy and
polluting, despite aeronautical designers' best
efforts. But in the future we may be travelling
in a flying wing or batwing (in which the entire
fuselage becomes the means of lift) == an idea first
suggested by Frederick Handley Page in 1961. Made
of plastic and with areas of the surface punctured
with tiny holes to reduce drag, the wings would be
much lighter and so more fuel efficient, and the
engines would be mounted on top to deflect noise
away from the ground. And they would be flown
differently, too: in formation perhaps, which would
reduce fuel consumption, and at different altitudes
to prevent the formation of polluting condensation
trails. The result could bring aircraft emissions
below today's levels by 2025, despite an expected
doubling in the amount of passenger air traffic.
Both Boeing and Airbus are already working on
flying-wing projects.</P>

<A NAME="_designer_carafes"> </a><br />
<H2>"DESIGNER CARAFES</H2>

<P>"It's ironic that in our bid to become healthier
by drinking more water, our  conviction that only
bottled water will do is causing increasingly precious
plastics to be thrown away (oil being an essential
component in plastic's  manufacture). Fashion designer
Pierre Cardin may have the solution. He has
just distributed 30,000 of his Eau de Paris designer
carafes for free in a  bid to convince Parisians that
the local tap water is just as healthy.</P>

<P>"The  idea is that many people buy bottled water in
response to marketing, so  getting them to drink tap
water requires a similar strategy. It's a simple
idea that, if it spread around the world, could
keep millions of plastic bottles out of landfills.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Mais oui, there's many a layer of irony here,
but I'll leave the excavation to the reader.)))</span></P>

<A NAME="_the_super-powered_electric_car"> </a><br />
<H2>"THE SUPER-POWERED ELECTRIC CAR</H2>

<P>"Electric cars: they're rather slow, aren't they?
They whir a bit and then  run out of juice on the
motorway? Not Tesla Motors' first car. This will be
a clutchless, Lotus-inspired roadster capable of
going from 0 to 60mph in  just four seconds, with
a top speed of 130mph. That's electricity with
attitude. And it does the equivalent of 135mpg.
The real benefit? This car  (named after the
electrical engineer Nikola Tesla) will generate
one-third  the CO2 and one-tenth the pollution of
hybrid cars == and, as Richard notes, as electricity
supplies get cleaner, so will the car. It can drive
for a  respectable 250 miles before its lithium-ion
battery needs recharging and will be available for
delivery from autumn of next year. Tesla Motors is
new in terms of its business model as well as
engineering; it's backed by the  founders of eBay,
Google and PayPal.<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.teslamotors.com">http://www.teslamotors.com</a><br /></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((And at its 130mph top speed, it'll run almost
but not quite two hours!)))</span></P>

<A NAME="_the_poweriser"> </a><br />
<H2>"THE POWERISER</H2>

<P>"If ever you thought people wobbling around on in-line
skates looked silly,  you'll be tickled pink by the
Poweriser. Essentially, these are springy
stilts that strap on to your calves and, once
you've got the hang of the correct rocking motion,
allow you to leap forward around five metres with a
single bound, leap vertically about two metres, and
generally upset the animals.</P>

<P>"With practice, this mode of transport is just as
green as skates, but faster. And a few stunts (of
the kind used in The Lion King stage production)
will impress the doubters: there is already a 'scene'
developing  around the device in Germany, where the
idea was first developed.</P>

<P>"'This one  is a bit out there,' admits Richard, 'but
as far as alternative  transportation goes, this has
got to be the coolest.'<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.powerisers.de">http://www.powerisers.de</a><br /></P>


<P><span class="bluetext">(((And if you think ski injuries and skateboard
burns make you look dashing, imagine jumping
five meters onto a fire hydrant!)))</span></P>

<P>"SOLAR-POWERED LEDs</P>

<P>"Picture a world in which the kids have to stop
reading because the sun has set. Or where you have
to burn dangerous, dirty and expensive kerosene to
see what you're doing. The Indian government hopes
to remedy this sutuation,  which affects 112,000 rural
villages across the country, over the next decade.</P>

<P>"The solution is a combination of light-emitting
diodes (LEDs) and solar power. The former are more
efficient than lightbulbs == the power  required to
light one conventional 100w bulb can now light an
entire village == and the latter allows electricity
to be stored in batteries and provides lighting where
there is no grid supply.</P>

<P>"Both LEDs and solar panels can also take the rough
and tumble of village life: having few moving parts,
they are very durable. 'People in the West often
take electricity for  granted, but in some places
just being able to see once the sun is gone is a
big deal,' says Richard.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Plus, with ample wattage, Indian kids can give
up reading schoolbooks and play with GameBoys just
like other kids!)))</span></P>
