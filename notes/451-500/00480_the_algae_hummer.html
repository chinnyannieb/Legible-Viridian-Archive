No snow in the Alps for ski season.  A few years
of this, and these airy enclaves of the rich will
go broke.  They'll be as deserted as the Ninth Ward
of New Orleans.</p>

<p><span class="bluetext">(((Reducing today's carbon emissions isn't going to
work.  We've clearly got too much carbon in the sky
already. The climate is destabilizing year by year
at today's levels of pollutant. Sooner rather than
later, we'll have to bend our attention to removing
the carbon that's already up there.  That's not a
"non-carbon economy" or "post-carbon economy" but a
carbon-removal economy, an anti-carbon economy)))</span>.</p>

<p><span class="bluetext">(((Likely methods for accomplishing this would be
found in the same industries that put the carbon up
there in the first place == lighting, heating and
transport tech that fixes CO2 rather than emitting it.
Instead of seeking a  lighter "environmental
footprint," these industries would  have a
deliberate environmental "handprint.")))</span></p>

<p><span class="bluetext">(((That's not impossible.  Cellulosic ethanol would
do that == it would pull some CO2 out of the sky
and fix it as topsoil in the biofuel fields.
That sounds counter-intuitive, but even
GM finds it thinkable.  They just proposed a Hummer
that improves the environment.  A car that is
better when bigger.  Imagine a world where you
couldn’t call yourself a serious environmentalist
without a huge car.  You'd drive a Hummer and hope
for snow.)))</span></p>

<h2>GM contemplates the living, breathing Hummer</h2>
<p>Fri Dec 1, 2006 11:05 AM GMT</p>


<p>LOS ANGELES (Reuters) == In the corporate imagination
of General Motors, Hummer could be transformed from
the SUV that environmentalists love to hate to an
algae-infused, oxygen-exuding buggy that would open
up like a flower.</p>

<p>GM's sketch for the "Hummer O2" was named the winner
on Thursday of a design contest at the Los Angeles
Auto Show that challenged major automakers to design
a vehicle with a five-year life span that could
be fully recycled.</p>

<p>The GM vision for the futuristic Hummer concept
includes an algae-filled body shell, designed to
shed oxygen, that also opens up like leaves on a
stem to catch sunlight when parked.</p>

<p>The concept sketch, which was produced by GM's
West Coast Advanced Design Studio, shows the
Hummer riding on an aluminum shell and powered
by a hydrogen tank and fuel cells.</p>

<p>"This design team said, 'We've done hybrids. We're
doing fuel cells. What's the next step that
actually improves the environment?'" said Frank
Saucedo, director of GM's California design lab.
Saucedo said the GM team had deliberately chosen
the polarizing Hummer brand for its imagined
environmental remake.</p>

<p>"People think of it as a military vehicle, as a
suburban SUV, but really these types of vehicles ==
the SUVs and the early Jeeps == were for people
who worked in the outdoors, environmentalists,
naturalists and outdoorsmen," he said. "This is
just us coming full circle."</p>

<p>GM said this week that its entire Hummer lineup
would offer biofuel engines, capable of running
on renewable fuels such as biodiesel, over the
next three years.</p>

<p>The GM entry in the Los Angeles Auto Show Design
Challenge won out over a number of equally
ambitious vehicle sketches from other automakers.
None of the sketches are even close to the full-blown
concept cars that automakers roll out at the
industry's major trade shows to generate buzz for
their brands.</p>

<p>Toyota suggested an electric-powered, tandem-style
vehicle with wicker seats that the occupants could
opt to pedal through stop-and-go Los Angeles
rush-hour traffic.</p>

<p>DaimlerChrysler's luxury Mercedes-Benz unit suggested
a diesel-burning convertible with wood panels that
could be easily replaced and recycled.</p>
