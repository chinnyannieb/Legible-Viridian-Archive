"Build 700 nuclear stations to replace fossil-fuel-
burning power plants, or increasing the use of solar
power by a factor of 700, or stopping all deforestation
and doubling present efforts at reforestation. Achieve
all three of these, and pull off four more equally
large-scale reallocations of capital and
infrastructure, and the world would probably stabilize
its carbon emissions."  Better get after it, then.)))</span></P>

<P>'James Lovelock: The Earth is about to catch a morbid
fever that may last as long as 100,000 years
'Each nation must find the best use of its resources
to sustain civilisation for as long as they can
Published: 16 January 2006</P>

<P>'Imagine a young policewoman delighted in the
fulfilment of her vocation; then imagine her having
to tell a family whose child had strayed that he had
been found dead, murdered in a nearby wood. Or think
of a young physician newly appointed who has to tell
you that the biopsy revealed invasion by an aggressive
metastasising tumour. Doctors and the police know that
many accept the simple awful truth with dignity but
others try in vain to deny it.</P>

<P>'Whatever the response, the bringers of such bad news
rarely become hardened to their task and some dread it.
We have relieved judges of the awesome responsibility
of passing the death sentence, but at least they had
some comfort from its frequent moral justification.
Physicians and the police have no escape from their
duty.</P>

<P>'This article is the most difficult I have written and
for the same reasons. My Gaia theory sees the Earth
behaving as if it were alive, and clearly anything
alive can enjoy good health, or suffer disease. Gaia
has made me a planetary physician and I take my
profession seriously, and now I, too, have to bring
bad news.  <span class="bluetext">(((I'm all for colorful, effective pop
science writing, but "Gaia" doesn't "make" any person
into any kind of planetary anything, much less a
planetary doctor or young female cop.)))</span></P>

<P>"The climate centres around the world, which are the
equivalent of the pathology lab of a hospital, have
reported the Earth's physical condition, and the
climate specialists see it as seriously ill, and soon
to pass into a morbid fever that may last as long as
100,000 years. I have to tell you, as members of the
Earth's family and an intimate part of it, that you
and especially civilisation are in grave danger.
<span class="bluetext">(((Okay, this part I'm buying.)))</span></P>

<P>'Our planet has kept itself healthy and fit for life,
just like an animal does, for most of the more than
three billion years of its existence. <span class="bluetext">(((Animals don't
make British scientists into planetary physicians.)))</span>
It was ill luck that we started polluting at a time
when the sun is too hot for comfort. We have given
Gaia a fever and soon her condition will worsen to a
state like a coma. She has been there before and
recovered, but it took more than 100,000 years. We
are responsible and will suffer the consequences:
as the century progresses, the temperature will rise
8 degrees centigrade in temperate regions and 5
degrees in the tropics.  <span class="bluetext">(((Why don't we just say
that "Gaia has made us into a suicide belt and blown
herself up?"  Wouldn't that be a lot less likely
to offend our amour-propre as we're roasting in the
lethal rays of Kindly Father Sun?)))</span></P>

<P>'Much of the tropical land mass will become scrub and
desert, and will no longer serve for regulation; this
adds to the 40 per cent of the Earth's surface we have
depleted to feed ourselves.  <span class="bluetext">(((What happens to that
40 per cent area of fertility when we humans are 90
percent dead?)))</span></P>

<P>'Curiously,  <span class="bluetext">(((interesting word choice there)))</span>
aerosol pollution of the northern hemisphere reduces
global warming by reflecting sunlight back to space.
This "global dimming" is transient and could disappear
in a few days like the smoke that it is, leaving us
fully exposed to the heat of the global greenhouse.
We are in a fool's climate, accidentally kept cool by
smoke, and before this century is over billions of us
will die and the few breeding pairs of people that
survive will be in the Arctic where the climate
remains tolerable.  <span class="bluetext">(((I don't want to cavil here,
but if smoke is all that's needed to keep us from
dwindling off like endangered polar penguins, what's
wrong with a brisk little nuclear exchange?  As I recall from 'nuclear winter theory,' 
those make
plenty of nice new fresh smoke.)))</span>
'By failing to see that the Earth regulates its climate
and composition, we have blundered into trying to do
it ourselves, acting as if we were in charge. <span class="bluetext">(((Unlike
Gaia, who's sitting there with the Three Fates weaving
those feedback loops.)))</span> By doing  this, we condemn
ourselves to the worst form of slavery. <span class="bluetext">(((Guantanamo?
Wait, I digress.)))</span></P>

<P>'If we chose to be the stewards of the Earth,
then we are responsible for keeping the atmosphere,
the ocean and the land surface right for life. A task
we would soon find impossible &ndash; and something before
we treated Gaia so badly, she had freely done for us.
<span class="bluetext">(((If you don't count those occasional ice ages and
the  annihilating meteor strikes.)))</span></P>

<P>'To understand how impossible it is, think about how
you would regulate your own temperature or the
composition of your blood. Those with failing kidneys
know the never-ending daily difficulty of adjusting
water, salt and protein intake. The technological fix
of dialysis helps, but is no replacement for living
healthy kidneys.  <span class="bluetext">(((Well, okay, but what if Gaia
gave me a lousy kidney? I mean, some of us are
born that way.)))</span></P>

<P>'My new book <STRONG>The Revenge of Gaia</STRONG> expands these
thoughts, but you still may ask why science took so
long to recognise the true nature of the Earth. I
think it is because Darwin's vision was so good and
clear that it has taken until now to digest it.
<span class="bluetext">(((Maybe Darwin should have written in a rather more
metaphorical, anthropomorphic, mystical fashion.)))</span>  In
his time, little was known about the chemistry of the
atmosphere and oceans, and there would have been
little reason for him to wonder if organisms changed
their environment as well as adapting to it.</P>

<P>'Had it been known then that life and the environment
are closely coupled, Darwin would have seen that
evolution involved not just the organisms, but the
whole planetary surface. We might then have looked
upon the Earth as if it were alive, and known that we
cannot pollute the air or use the Earth's skin &ndash; its
forest and ocean ecosystems &ndash; as a mere source of
products to feed ourselves and furnish our homes.
We would have felt instinctively that those ecosystems
must be left untouched because they were part of the
living Earth.  <span class="bluetext">(((Maybe, but I've noticed that when
people lack shelter and food, 'instinctive feelings'
are the first things they jettison.)))</span></P>

<P>'So what should we do?  <span class="bluetext">(((Die in large numbers from
the grim consequences of our obscurantist inattention
to physical reality.)))</span> First, we have to keep in mind
the awesome pace of change and realise how little time
is left to act; and then each community and nation must
find the best use of the resources they have to sustain
civilisation for as long as they can. <span class="bluetext">(((Imagine
preaching this screed to the Akkadians, Mayans, Easter
Islanders and Greenland Vikings.  "The best use of the
resources WE have?  What about those OTHER GUY'S
resources?")))</span>  Civilisation is energy-intensive and
we cannot turn it off without crashing,  <span class="bluetext">(((Look, if
we're gonna crash anyway, it makes perfect logical
sense to crash NOW before "Gaia" gets even more
peeved)))</span> so we need  the security of a powered
descent.  <span class="bluetext">((("Security"?)))</span> On these British Isles,
<span class="bluetext">(((Hey, speak for yourself, perfidious foreigner)))</span>
we are used  to thinking of all humanity and not
just ourselves; environmental change is global, but
we have to deal with the consequences here in the UK.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((I'm all for a tidy, eco-shipshape UK, but I question
whether that would do much about a shift in the
North Atlantic currents.  If environmental change
is global, even localities have to deal with global
consequences, not local ones.)))</span></P>

<P>"Unfortunately our nation is now so urbanised as to
be like a large city and we have only a small acreage
of agriculture and forestry. We are dependent on the
trading world for sustenance; climate change will deny
us regular supplies of food and fuel from overseas.
<span class="bluetext">(((I'm not quite sure how this is supposed to work.
If there's no food anywhere, then everybody dies in
short order. If there's food, but it's too difficult
or expensive to ship, then every locality who doesn't
produce a local agricultural surplus dies, not just
Britain. If we entered a period of mass global famine,
we would die off hugely and suddenly, in that
thoughtful way that Gaia culls lemmings and deer herds.
In a matter of a few years the survivors would be
in a nigh-empty global wilderness.  It might be stormy,
but the emission problem would be history.)))</span></P>

<P>"We could grow enough to feed ourselves on the diet of
the Second World War,  <span class="bluetext">(((really?  Wow)))</span> but the
notion that there is land to spare to grow biofuels,
or be the site of wind farms, is ludicrous.  <span class="bluetext">(((Aren't
British wind farms largely offshore? Besides, hasn't
the NIMBY crowd starved by now?)))</span> We will do our best
to survive, but sadly I cannot see the United States
or the emerging economies of China and India cutting
back in time, and they are the main source of
emissions. <span class="bluetext">(((Britain is starving while USA, China and
India are chugging right along?  Who's shipping food to
China?)))</span> The worst will happen and survivors will
have to adapt to a hell of a climate.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((If Lovelock were Chinese he would have written
an article where China starves horribly as America,
Britain and India all chuckle and play pinochle.)))</span></P>


<P>"Perhaps the saddest thing is that Gaia will lose as
much or more than we do.  <span class="bluetext">(((On the plus side, Gaia
won't pen any editorials about that.)))</span> Not only will
wildlife and whole ecosystems go extinct, but in human
civilisation the planet has a precious resource. We
are not merely a disease;  <span class="bluetext">(((hey, speak for yourself,
planetary physician)))</span> we are, through our intelligence
and communication, the nervous system of the planet.
Through us, Gaia has seen herself from space, and
begins to know her place in the universe.  <span class="bluetext">(((And then,
through us, her nervous system, Gaia went into the
garage, turned on the engine and died of the
fumes.)))</span></P>

<P>"We should be the heart and mind of the Earth, not its
malady. <span class="bluetext">(((If we're heart and mind, plus nerves and
damaged  kidneys to boot, Gaia's got very few organs
left.)))</span> So let us be brave and cease thinking of human
needs and rights alone, and see that we have harmed
the living Earth and need to make our peace with Gaia.
We must do it while we are still strong enough to
negotiate, and not a broken rabble led by brutal war
lords.  <span class="bluetext">(((Speaking of broken rabble led by brutal
war lords, I'm moving to Belgrade in a couple of
days.  It was calamitous for years, but nowadays
I kinda like it there.)))</span> Most of all, we should
remember that we are  a part of it, and it is indeed
our home.'</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((For all the acerbic fun I've had with it, this
is a very disturbing article.  After some days'
consideration, I've come to this conclusion about it.
I don't think humanity has the capacity to put "Gaia"
into a 100,000 year "coma."  Humanity's heading for
the clinic before Gaia does; we've already got
dubious food security, some cracking little resource
wars and emergent major-league diseases.  We don't
have the capacity to expand industrial development
flat-out while being hammered by global climate change
and three out of four apocalyptic horsemen.
We won't need Gaia's Revenge to do us in &ndash; by
the time Gaia was good and ready, we'd be doin'
a heck of a job eliminating ourselves.)))</span></P>
