<H2>'Catastrophe' for Austin if wildfires hit</H2>

<P><strong>Official says crews could not fend off blazes like the ones raging in the Panhandle.</strong><br><br>
By Laylan Copelin, Claire Osborn, <a href="http://www.statesman.com">AMERICAN-STATESMAN</a> STAFF  <span class="bluetext">(((Thank you Laylan 
Copelin and Clair Osborn, genuine working journalists!)))</span><br><br>Thursday, March 16, 2006</P>

<P>AMARILLO &ndash; Authorities urged residents in six Panhandle towns to evacuate Wednesday 
and warned that the state's largest wildfire outbreak in history could cross into 
Oklahoma.</P>

<P>Fire officials recommended that about 3,000 residents in Lipscomb County, in the far 
northeastern corner of the Panhandle, evacuate after winds gusting to 30 miles per hour 
began spreading the fire that started near Borger on Sunday. However, the county judge 
stopped short of making the evacuation mandatory.</P>


<P>Although this fire was raging in sparsely populated ranching country, Texas Forest 
Service Director James B. Hull warned Wednesday that such a fire striking Austin and 
Travis County would yield a more nightmarish fate.</P>

<P>"Austin is going to be the worst catastrophe Texas has ever seen," Hull said as he 
toured firefighting operations in the Panhandle. "The conditions we're having in the 
Panhandle right now, when it gets to Austin, it will be a tragedy."</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((I started the Viridian Movement in 1998, when wildfires from drought-stricken 
jungles in Chiapas were spewing smoke over Austin in an arc that reached Chicago. Today 
it's not Mexico.
It's here.  Two percent of the landmass of Texas has burned since Christmas.  Here, 
look:)))</span></P>

<P>Mix drought conditions and high winds in an urban-area forest like the cedar-covered 
hills of western Travis County and the area would be a tinder box of gigantic proportions, 
Hull said.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((There shouldn't be that much cedar fuel there.
Cedar is full of volatile cedar oils.  Cedar used to burn when grasslands caught fire from 
natural causes.
Thanks to barbed wire, however, Texas is no longer the
open range, so the cedar proliferates rapidly.
I happen to be violently allergic to cedar pollen (the tree in question is 'mountain 
juniper,' strictly speaking), so there's a certain schadenfreude here, but if you've ever 
seen dry cedar burn, which I have, those trees go up like oil-bombs.)))</span></P>


<P>Austin Fire Department Battalion Chief Palmer Buck
agreed: "It would not be what house we are going to save... it would be what neighborhood 
are we going to save."</P>

<P>The Fire Department does not have the resources to fight a major wildfire in the hills 
along Lake Austin or the rugged terrain of the Balcones Canyonlands Preserve area, Buck 
said.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Nobody's "got the resources" to deal with climate change.  It's gonna take a massive 
remobilization of the whole economic base, something like a comprehensive,  1989-style 
shock.  In the meantime, they're trying to patch it up with mercenaries, so they don't 
have to take charge themselves.
Who's gonna pay these guys? Climate change doesn't mean a passing aberration or two.  It 
means a changed climate.  We're going to have vast corps of people doing this: for 
keeps.)))</span></P>

<P>Hull, whose agency is charged with coordinating
wildfire response, said the Legislature never has
fully funded a state wildfire plan developed in 1998.
<span class="bluetext">(((Great job Brownie!  Do you know why Hull is going
on the record with all this?  Because Hull's in charge
and Hull knows what happened to Brownie.)))</span></P>

<P>Senate Finance Committee Chairman Steve Ogden, R-Bryan,
said Wednesday that lawmakers have not been able to
give the forest service all the money it needs because
of ongoing budget constraints.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((The planet's going broke, you incompetent morons!
The state you represent is on fire!  Stop doing the
"ostrich maneuver!"  Do you think your fatcat
oil lobbyists are going to pay to rebuild your own
homes?)))</span><BR>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((This is the capital's newspaper of record, soberly
discussing the likelihood of the state's capital going
up in an inferno!  Austin is where you meet to divvy up
the pork!  Do you think you're going to breeze your
way to re-election in the middle of a flaming Katrina?
You're too stupid to live!)))</span></P>

<P>"One of the issues that the Legislature needs to look
at &ndash; now that we've had serious outbreaks of fires &ndash;
is whether or not in hindsight we should have funded
that," Ogden said. Legislators had questioned whether
rural firefighters and cities already had enough
equipment to fight serious fires, Ogden said.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((They're NOT GOING AWAY, these climate crises.
Texas has the most violent and unstable weather in
North America.  The wolf is at the door, pal.  If
a scientist cries wolf, you can spin that, but if the
wolf is at the door, you can't spin him.)))</span></P>

<P>Hull says they don't.</P>

<P>The 1,800 volunteer fire departments with 40,000
firefighters are the backbone of protection in rural
communities. But almost half those departments have
budgets of $10,000 or less. Hull said volunteer
departments often have old equipment and are not
equipped to battle blazes that last days or weeks.
<span class="bluetext">(((Not "days or weeks." DECADES! LIFETIMES!  Wake up
to it!  Get used to it!  Hell, if Lovelock is right,
we end up huddled around molten puddles at the poles!  And you're in there gerrymandering? 
That's what you've
got to contribute, as a political leadership?   It's
your watch!  New Orleans is a day-trip away, people!
New Orleans is a basketcase, just like Galveston was
in 1901.  You're like some kind of Brezhnev Comintern
who pulls the curtains over the windows so that nobody
notices that the train has stopped. God help you.)))</span></P>


<P>If the state fully funded the wildfire plan, it could
do more, Hull said.</P>

<P>When Sunday's 55-mph winds first fueled the Panhandle
fires, the state at first could offer only minimal
backup to local fire departments. The Texas Forest
Service had a management team in Amarillo and,
luckily,  had been able to get five large air tankers
from the U.S. Forest Service to fly from Albuquerque,
N.M., and Ardmore, Okla., to drop fire retardant.</P>

<P>Typically, those planes would be fighting fires in
other parts of the country,  <span class="bluetext">((("typically")))</span> and
Texas would have to rely on eight National Guard
helicopters to fly large buckets of water to the
fires. The war in Iraq, however, has reduced that
option. <span class="bluetext">(((How handy.)))</span></P>


<P>"There have been times when none of the helicopters
were available," Hull said.<BR>
He said several states, including California, Georgia,
Florida, Minnesota and North Carolina, maintain their
own fleets. Even if Texas can't afford that, Hull said,
the state should have planes under contract for
emergencies.  <span class="bluetext">(((How do you "afford" losing major
towns to catastrophes?  Do you have a line-item for
that?)))</span></P>

<P>"Texas is 'renting' its fire protection from other
states and the federal government," Hull said.</P>

<P>Although state firefighting officials were able to
predict the threat of the Panhandle fires because of
the projected wind speeds, drought conditions and low
humidity, they had no firefighting equipment on the
ground to back up local operations.</P>

<P>Twenty-four firefighters from Travis County arrived
Wednesday to help fight a 54,000-acre fire south of
Childress.</P>

<P>Part of the problem is the sheer size of the state.
<span class="bluetext">(((It's the sheer size of the planet.)))</span></P>

<P>"We're fighting fires all the way from Laredo to East
Texas, through the Hill Country, to here in the
Panhandle," Hull said. "We're stretched very
thin."  <span class="bluetext">(((Meanwhile, Oklahoma's kindling.  Good thing
we Texans don't need to fret about that, eh?)))</span></P>

<P>In 1998, the Forest Service, a state agency affiliated
with Texas A&amp;M University, provided the Legislature
with a wildfire protection plan.</P>

<P>Hull said it calls for stationing people and
firefighting resources regionally so it would be
easier to support local efforts. On top of the $4
million a year the state gives his agency for the
wildfire prevention plan, Hull said he needs another
$12 million to fully implement the plan.</P>

<P>Lawmakers actually raised the agency's total budget
(which includes operations beyond firefighting)
slightly to $23.7 million last year. That came at a
time when other agencies faced reductions to balance
the budget, House Speaker Tom Craddick said.</P>

<P>"Regretfully, the Legislature is unable to anticipate
natural disasters of this kind," Craddick said.
<span class="bluetext">(((That's because, in order to support your lords and masters in the fossil fuel industry, 
you are
blindfolding yourself and the population in order to
march faster off the cliff.  Of course you could
"anticipate" it!  You don't WANT to anticipate it, so,
instead, you obfuscated it.  You are living a lie.)))</span>
"We are currently working with the Forest Service
staff to address their funding needs as they deal with
this emergency."  <span class="bluetext">(((Perhaps you can rename the Forest
Service as the "Blackened Wasteland Homeland Security
Service".)))</span></P>

<P>Gov. Rick Perry's office said that the state is already
doing some of the regional planning Hull is talking
about and that the forest service might be able to
shift money from other parts of its budget.
<span class="bluetext">(((I take a certain grim satisfaction in watching
this happen while this Republican know-nothing is in
office.  Even if Perry's replaced by a japing radical
lunatic like Kinky Friedman, however, that's not gonna
reduce the intensity of the 2006 hurricane season.
Not to mention 2007, 08, 09, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15,
16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28,
29, 30, 2031...  The climate change problem is
already two hundred years old.)))</span></P>

<P>"There's been a whole lot of disaster planning that
has occurred since 1998, and what the governor has
directed... is to pre-position assets, firefighters
and equipment in location so they can be moved as
quickly as possible to areas that have the need,"
Perry spokeswoman Kathy Walt said.  <span class="bluetext">(((You need to
preposition people in oil wells and coal-fired power
plants, and shut the damned things off.)))</span></P>


<P>Perry will visit the Panhandle today. A study done
by the Austin Fire Department in 2003 showed that
about 50,000 homes in Travis County are in either
extreme- or high-risk fire zones. Fire officials
have been holding educational sessions in high-risk
neighborhoods asking residents to clear brush away
from their homes, Buck said.<BR>
<span class="bluetext">(((Are you an Austinite?  Do it.  I know the tree
looks pretty and you want to hug it.  A burning tree
is not the friend of your roof.  Or your neighbor's roof.)))</span></P>

<P>Since Dec. 1, Hull said, there have been 8,900
wildfires in Texas fought at a cost of $41 million,
which will be shared by the federal, state and local
governments. Eighty-five percent of the fires
started within two miles of a town or city.</P>


<P>"Texas still has a rural mentality," Hull said.
"But with 22.5 million people, we are an urban state,
and we have to plan for that urban catastrophe."</P>
