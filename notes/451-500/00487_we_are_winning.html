<P><span class="bluetext">(((The boiled frog is jumping.  It turns out that a 
boiled frog always jumps. To think otherwise was 
a mere urban legend. The frog won't jump free from 
its dire, life-threatening menace at the first effort,
but next year will be even hotter and scarier, 
and the frog will jump harder. From now on, the frog
will jump all the time.  Further urging to jump will
not be required from the likes of us Viridians. 
The frog has gotten the message. We are winning!)))</span><BR>

I doubt we will ever reach 500 of these.  That won't
be needed: because we are winning.)))</span><BR>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((The cogent quote from the  first Viridian speech,
eight years ago:)))</span></P>

<P>"Now let me explain to you why my 21st century design
movement is going to be a great technical improvement
over  all previous art movements.  Let me give you 
a tour of its many unique and innovative features.</P>

<P>"Number One.   Perhaps most importantly, this
movement has a built-in expiration date.   The problem
with previous art movements is this unexamined 
assumption that  they have discovered some eternal 
cultural truth, and that  they will therefore go on 
forever.   In point of fact, no  matter how much truth
they discover, movements never do last very long.</P>

<P>"So, this is where our movement gets it built-in 
expiration date.  The date is 2012, a date in the Kyoto
accords, when people are supposed to be engaged in a
serious decline in CO2 emissions."</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((We Viridians have beaten that clock. There is no 
need to wait for distant 2012 to declare victory in 
our war to make green trendy and to create 
"irresistible demand for a global atmosphere upgrade."
Green will never get any trendier than it is this year.
The atmosphere upgrade is on the way.  That process 
won't be pretty, but it's going to happen.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((The 2012 deadline for  Kyoto is already a dead 
letter, because Kyoto was far too weak and too slow.
We are going to see a series of monstrous efforts by
large  enterprises: private, local, state and national,
to save whatever can be saved of the previous natural
order.  The primary motivator of this effort will 
be fear.   The climate is changing much more quickly
and more severely than anyone suspected it would. 
A rapid, ruthless, headlong clean-tech techno- 
revolution &ndash; in fact, a series of them &ndash; is 
the only global option with a ghost of a chance to 
save our smoldering planetary bacon.  That's coming;
it is under way.)))</span></P>

<P>((When the Davos Economic Forum steals your clothes,
there's no reason left to wear them any more.
We are winning.  The Great and the Good agree with 
us.  They're more scared than we ever were.)))</span> <br>

"Ten Major U.S. Companies Join Environmental Defense
and Others to Endorse Mandatory Limits on America's 
Global Warming Pollution. Watch press conference live
this morning on CSPAN at 11:30am Eastern."  <span class="bluetext">(((These
companies are demanding carbon regulation in order to
punish their competitors.  They have a jump in going
clean,  and their competitors, who were stubborn and
fatally tardy,  will be destroyed. Not in a week, no:
but in five years they'll be deader than Enron.  They
have fatally misjudged the flow of events, they threw
a war-for-carbon and lost it, they have no friends 
left and a million commercial enemies sharpening 
knives...  they are doomed.)))</span><br>

<P>"The companies involved in today's announcement are 
well-known Fortune 500 corporations: Alcoa, BP America,
Caterpillar, Duke Energy, DuPont, Florida Power and 
Light, General Electric, Lehman Brothers, Pacific Gas
&amp; Electric, and PNM Resources. They have joined 
Environmental Defense, the World Resources 
Institute, Pew Center on Global Climate Change, and 
Natural Resources Defense Council to form an 
unprecedented alliance &ndash; the United States Climate 
Action Partnership (US-CAP)."  <span class="bluetext">(((If you are Exxon, 
what is your response when you see this?  Your PR 
reaction is contempt.  Your private response is 
anguish.  Fear, and a desperate attempt to muddle 
and temporize.  It's not just that Viridians are 
winning.  Denialists are losing.  Horribly. 
We win.  They're toast.)))</span><br>

move: but you made your bed of Procrustes and you will
be torn to pieces.  First, denial: you tried that 
for years.  Then anger.  You'll try that, that will 
be brief.  Then resignation... and at last you'll beg
for pity, but, although you're the world's largest 
and most profitable corporation, you have brought 
such fantastic suffering onto such vast hosts of 
other people that there will not be a drop of pity 
left for you.)))</span><BR>

<P><span class="bluetext">((("Corporate Green."  Get used to this.  It's what's
for breakfast, lunch and supper.  You're going to get
Corporate Green whether you like it or not.  Green is
is sexy as it's ever going to get, right now, 02007.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((When the brown alternative begins disappearing 
wholesale, when that's simply unavailable and we have
to live Corporate Green, then green will not be sexy.
No, Green will just be what there is.  Brown could not
be sustained.  So Brown died.  Green will work better
eventually, but when we first get it, the alpha- 
rollout of a sustainable world... man, is that ever 
going to suck.  I own some eco-chic shoes.  I had to
stop wearing them because they were rotting right off
of my feet.  It'll be like that, okay? Only more so.
We're not gonna win pretty; we are gonna win kinda 
ugly, frankly &ndash; but we are winning.)))</span></P>

"This year's Greenbuild, the annual conference of the US Green Building Council (USGBC), 
was all about two things:</P>

<P>"Green has gone corporate &ndash; and that's exactly what
everybody wanted. Past gatherings may have been 
intimate affairs, but this year's event, in Denver, 
was a full-scale trade show, with 13,000 attendees 
walking around with tan totes emblazoned with Honda 
on the side, lots of corporate-sponsored parties, and
a sold-out exhibition hall, with 700 exhibitors 
hawking their green products. It left little doubt 
that green, at least as it's represented by the USGBC,
isn't about the counter-culture anymore."  <span class="bluetext">(((Because
it is not the "counterculture," it's the culture.

successfully changing culture:  "That's ridiculous,"
"it's true but trivial," "I always said so."  Terra 
Rossa are Christian white-green albedo right-wing 
greens.  Do you understand what this means?  The right
cannot go away.  The right you always have with you. When the right steals your clothes, 
that means you win.
We Viridians have cruised through those three stages
in jig time.  We are winning.)))</span><BR>

Evangelical Ecologist.  I don't know their slogan, 
so I'll say "for maximum cognitive dissonance." 
Look at that awesome blogroll of lunatics you've 
never heard of.  I wouldn't trust these clowns 
with a burnt-out match, but they're there because 
they HAVE to be there.<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.evaneco.com/">http://www.evaneco.com/</A></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Okay: did we do all this ourselves?  No, of 
course not.  But it's a lot easier to get something 
done when you don't bother to take credit for 
doing it.  Do all these people we claim as "successors"
even know we exist?  Maybe not.  Likely not.  And 
that's GOOD.  That means we win.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((This isn't the first time I've seen this happen. 
I remember when there was such a thing as "cyberpunk":
visionaries in the early 1980s writing farfetched, 
daring stories that predicted that someday there would
be a world rather like the late 1990s.  We didn't 
create that world, but it was obvious.  Now the prefix
"cyber" has gone away &ndash; not because it failed, but 
because it is EVERYWHERE.  There is nothing left now
that isn't "cyber."  The "virtual" is going away, too.
The word "actual" is older than the word "virtual," so
when the one subsumes the other, the virtual vanishes
and becomes the actual.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((We Viridians used to be a rather novel effort, 
virtual activists in a cyber space: today there is no
other kind.  It's all the same.  There is no 
such thing as a political, aesthetic, cultural,
literary, military, governmental or nongovernmental 
movement without a digital component.  Such a thing 
is no longer possible, such things no longer exist.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((This means that it is becoming  necessary for 
us to vanish.  Not because we are losing.  If we 
were losing &ndash; like the Arts and Crafts movement 
lost, like Modernism lost &ndash; then we could complain 
for the next dozen decades.  Viridian is <STRONG>winning.</STRONG> 
We threw a match or two, and less than a decade 
later the planet is consumed in prairie fires. 
The smart thing to do is to stop.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Then what happens?  There are two choices.  You 
can attempt to seize control, or you can get out 
of the way.  Oh wait, there's a third choice: 
getting cold feet and apologizing for having won. 
I didn't mention that option because that one 
didn't occur to me.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((We are winning because we were ahead of the curve:
we Viridians were an avant-garde who understood, 
almost ten years ago, that something like this was 
bound to happen.  That does not make us the proper 
people to actually carry it out.  First, we don't 
have the scale, the resources, or the ability. 
Second, and let me be very clear to you here: 
the primrose path to sustainability, even it is
construed as sexy, trendy and stylish,  will be 
dark and thorny. Behind Corporate Green is its 
darker, bloodstained cousin, Khaki Green, and we'll 
be seeing a lot of that.  Sustainability will be a 
comprehensive revolution in the tenor of daily life.
There will be blood on the hands of the people who 
bring it about.  Not because they are bloodthirsty. 
But because there is so much blood.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Genuine climate mayhem is underway.  It is 
intensifying fast.  People are going to die: of heat,
of disease, freezing, starving, drowning and dying of
thirst.  Not in mere tens of thousands as they 
did in the Paris heatwave, but in hecatombs.  We 
have a global climate crisis.  A real one, not a futurist
speculation.  People are going to make agonizing 
sacrifices in increasingly frantic  efforts 
to ameliorate that and redress that crisis.  Then, next
year, they will discover that the situation 
is vastly worse than then imagined, and the spillage
of blood and treasure and sacred honor that they 
thought would surely help is a fraction of what was necessary.)))</span></P>


<P><span class="bluetext">(((Two thousand people on an email list 
are not the masters of a global situation.  We're going
to be sucked into it just like everybody else is. 
Nevertheless, we are winning.  And that's good news.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((The climate crisis is in its Neville Chamberlain 
phase right now.  People still imagine that a 
concern with the climate is trendy, and that a judicious
head-nod here will mean peace in our time.  Those 
people are not merely mistaken, they are delusionary.
They are nodding in disdain at the basic laws of 
physics.  The human race has spent two industrious 
centuries unearthing the planetary dead and setting 
them aflame in the sky. There is hell to pay for 
an affront like that, and it's all ahead of us in 
this century.  We are in in 2007 and we are about 
seven percent of the way into very, very deep and 
very, very hot water.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Nevertheless, the frog will jump from that hot 
water.  We are winning.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((I wish, very much, that we were not winning 
on those awesome and frightening terms, but we 
are winning.  Our ideas are becoming mainstream ideas.
Our approaches and assumptions will be mainstream 
approaches and assumptions. Our ideas are becoming 
truisms. They are being absorbed at such a deep and 
irrevocable level that they'll become cliches. 
The victory condition for successful prophecy is 
not prophecy.  It's cliche'. Viridian is becoming 
cliched.  Our sensibility is becoming mainstream 
sensibility.  And that is good news.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((That means it is time to declare victory. 
Further rhetorical effort on this line is not required,
and the cleverest activist tactic when you get what 
you want is to take it and vanish into the woodwork.
A strutting triumphalism will only annoy people who 
are doomed to end up thinking like us anyhow. So, the
sooner we can vanish and let them get on with the 
hard, sweaty labor of jumping from a boiling pot, 
the better off the world will be.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((I am thinking hard about what comes next.  Some 
different enterprise should build on this achievement.
It'll take me a while to understand that, but it should
be as far ahead of 2007 as Viridian was ahead of events
in 1998. Likely a little farther.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((I'm good at thinking ahead: the track record shows
that my speculations, even the daffiest and most 
sarcastic ones, do tend  to be crowned with some success.
Still, I tend to oversell my own foresight: Viridian shows
that events and developments that  I imagine 
are twenty years out, are  only about eight or nine.
As a futurist, I'm clearly not  trying hard enough. 
Next time, I'll try to take a bigger bite.)))</span></P>
