a former Democrat, and current Republican (who cares?
They're both for sale).<BR><br>
Bloomberg's self-set salary as mayor of New York
is one dollar. He's hugely popular. "Hey, rich people:
you bought the world, you fix it." Bloomberg is
the kind of guy who would take a wisecrack

<h2>Long Term Planning in New York City &ndash; Challenges and Goals</P></h2>

<P>by Michael Bloomberg</P>

<P>Gotham Gazette, December 12, 2006</P>

<P>Mayor Michael Bloomberg outlined the major challenges
facing New York City as it tries to develop a
25-year sustainability plan, and its goals in
forming such a plan, in a speech at the Queens
Museum of Art on December 12, 2006.
<span class="bluetext">(((I have to like it that he chose to do this in
a Museum of Art. Very Medici-like.)))</span></P>

<P>The speech was followed by a video presentation
and panel discussion about these challenges.
The text of the speech is below; you can also
watch a video of the entire event by clicking here:</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Can't beat it for net-centric politics.)))</span></P>

<P>
"New York City 2030: Accepting the Challenge"</P>

<P>Thank you to the League of Conservation Voters
for hosting us today as we look ahead to the year
2030, and to the immense challenges facing our city.</P>

<P>Some might think that whatever happens by then won't
be our problem. But, speaking for myself, I'm going
to be 88 years old, and the kind of city we
have will certainly matter to me. (What's more,
my mother will be 121, and she might come for a
visit some time.) <span class="bluetext">(((Hey look! The zillionaire's
got a mom, just like an everyday guy!)))</span></P>

<P>And that's why we've come together today at the
Queens Museum, which plays such a vital role in
the cultural and civic life of Queens, and which
I also want to thank for their hospitality.</P>

<P>Because it's here in Flushing Meadows, in the heart
of Helen Marshall's borough, <span class="bluetext">(((it's kind of awesome,
the way city politicians learn to name-check minor
players the rest of us have never heard of)))</span> that
more than once, New Yorkers have looked beyond the
present, to see the promise of the future.</P>

<P>Whether it was at the 1939 World's Fair, when
men and women still feeling the effects of the
Great Depression dared to imagine a dazzling "World
of Tomorrow," <span class="bluetext">(((actually, that was mostly designers
like Loewy and Bel Geddes imagining a world-tomorrow,
whilst the American public gaped at New York in vague
incomprehension)))</span> or at the 1964 World's Fair, whose
glorious panorama you just walked through, and which
featured the futuristic wonders of what people were
starting to call 'the global village.' <span class="bluetext">(((Kinda liking
the nostalgic sci-fi pitch here, Mr. Mayor!)))</span></P>

<P>LONG TERM PLANNING: WHAT'S BEEN DONE IN THE LAST
FIVE YEARS</P>

<P>Only five years ago, looking 25 years into the
future might have seemed unimaginable. After 9/11,
we weren't sure what even the next day would hold.
Instead of looking ahead, many people were looking
back, fearful of seeing a return to the days when
New York's dangerous streets, graffitied subways,
and abandoned housing were national symbols of urban
decay. <span class="bluetext">(((I used to visit New York in those days,
and yeah, New York was much, much scarier than it is
during the "War on Terror.")))</span></P>

<P>We recalled seeing our city's population plummet by
nearly one million people in just ten year's time.
Many of us remember that era all too well.</P>

<P>And many of us have worked hard over the years to bring New York &ndash; and new New Yorkers &ndash; back &ndash; and then some. <span class="bluetext">(((I hope you've got room for millions
of Australians yearning to breathe free of airborne
soot.)))</span></P>

<P>The past five years have truly rewarded our efforts.
Building on the successes of our predecessors, we've
driven crime down to levels last seen when the '64
World's Fair opened. Our welfare rolls are lower than
they were in 1964, as well. Today, our streets are
cleaner than they've been in 30 years. We've increased
high school graduation rates to a 20-year high. Our
bond rating is the best ever. Unemployment is at an
all-time record low. New Yorkers are living longer
than the average American for the first time since
World War II.<BR><br>
<span class="bluetext">(((That's a lot of mayoral bragging, but it must
be pleasant to have so much to brag about. Record
low unemployment and expanding lifespans? Sounds
like Sweden.)))</span></P>

<p>And the most visible symbol &ndash; and source &ndash; of New York City's comeback is that we're growing again &ndash; our population is at an all-time high.
 <span class="bluetext">(((Hey yeah, and even the darkside bird-flu estimates
are forecasting a mere 68 million dead! That's
barely one human being in a hundred! Bring on the
population bomb, the mayor's with us all the way!)))</span>
Link:<BR>
<br><a href="http://www.itv.com/news/world_71fc1ed238921413b3190c2d06661f0b.html">http://www.itv.com/news/world_71fc1ed238921413b3190c2d06661f0b.html</A></P>

<P>A generation of dedicated New Yorkers &ndash; including
 many in this room <span class="bluetext">(((can't name-check the audience,
you're too humble for that, but you know who you
are)))</span> have all played a role in making this happen.
I want to especially acknowledge the strong
leadership provided by my predecessors: Mayors Koch,
Dinkins, and Giuliani. <span class="bluetext">(((Kind of a nice politically
ecumenical class act there. He didn't <STRONG>have</STRONG> to say
nice things about the former mayors.)))</span> As a city, we stand on their shoulders &ndash; and because we do, we are standing taller and stronger than ever.
We should be proud of what we've achieved together, not just over the past five years &ndash; but over the past twenty-five.</P>

<P>It would be easy to sit back now and enjoy what we've
done. To let our successors worry about the future.
But we must not become complacent. That's not how
New York became great. And it's not how I plan to
spend the last 1,115 days of my term as mayor!</P>

<P>Over the first eighteen hundred days, we've already
begun making the investments that will ensure the
city's long-term future: A $4 billion commitment to finishing the Third Water Tunnel &ndash; double what's
 been spent by the last five administrations combined</P>

<span class="bluetext">(((unlike Australia, New York has water handy)))</span>;
 $1.6 billion to build the vital Croton water
filtration plant <span class="bluetext">(((and we'll recycle water if we
run out for some weird climatic reason)))</span>; and
$13 billion for the largest school capital plan
in the city's history. <span class="bluetext">(((Even if the kids can't use
cellphones in class. And no, in New York, they
can't. I don't know why we require children
to pay coherent attention to something for so many
hours a day when adults sure can't.)))</span></P>

<P>We're turning Fresh Kills, once the world's largest
landfill, into the biggest new city park in more
than a century. <span class="bluetext">(((Presumably it's still a large
landfill, but with a nice park layered on top of it.
Come on, hey, that's progressive! They could
rename it "Stale Kills" and mine it for methane.)))</span></P>

<P>And a few days ago, we sold bonds for the Number 7
line, the first major extension of the subway system
in decades, and the first in modern memory paid for
by the city. <span class="bluetext">(((It's public transit! Come on! What
greenie can't love the Republican here?)))</span>
But we also know that much more work needs to be done.</P>

<P>THE NEXT 25 YEARS: LOOKING FORWARD<br>
<span class="bluetext">(((It's getting good here.)))</span></P>

<P>Last January, I asked Deputy Mayor Dan Doctoroff to
develop a long-term land use plan for the city. At
the time, we both thought it was a project that
would take just a few months. But as we worked, we discovered the sheer scale of what was ahead &ndash; the intricacy, urgency, and interdependency of the
challenges we face. <span class="bluetext">(((Sounds very Rocky Mountain
Institute.)))</span></P>

<P>We realized that unless we considered the full range
of challenges to our city's physical environment,
the progress we'd worked so long and so hard for
might be at risk. And it became clear that to secure
a stronger, cleaner, and healthier city for our
children and grandchildren, we had to start acting now. In short, we realized that New York needed &ndash;
 not a long-term plan for land use, but a long-term
plan for sustainability.</P>

<P>'Sustainability' is a word that's used a lot these
days. <span class="bluetext">(((Yo!)))</span> But at its heart, it simply means
striving to make our city greater, not just for
ourselves, but for those generations to come. Today,
we have a rare opportunity to achieve that goal.
Because with the city's immediate prospects as
healthy as they are, and with our Administration
not beholden to special interests <span class="bluetext">(((except me,
and what the heck, I'm already richer than Croesus)))</span>,
or big campaign contributors, <span class="bluetext">(((Who needs 'em?
I'm my own financier!)))</span> we now have the freedom
to take on the obstacles looming in the city's
future, and to begin clearing them away before they
become rooted in place.</P>

<P>To help us meet that challenge, we created a new
Office of Long Term Planning and Sustainability.
<span class="bluetext">(((And I bet it's got a great budget! Green
pundits, start lining up now!)))</span>
They're supported by a team from more than 15
City agencies. Joining them have been some of the
best and the brightest: independent scientists,
<span class="bluetext">(((Not those bought-and-paid-for Exxon-Mobil
frauds, <STRONG>actual</STRONG> scientists)))</span> think tank
scholars, <span class="bluetext">(((not the "Project for a New American
Century" because my 'thinktank' isn't like that)))</span>
respected academics and city planners, and
innovative green builders.</P>

<P>Link:
<br><a href="http://www.tehrantimes.com/Description.asp?Da=12/24/2006&Cat=2&Num=019">http://www.tehrantimes.com/Description.asp?Da=12/24/2006&amp;Cat=2&amp;Num=019</A>
"'The Project for the New American Century' has
been reduced to a voice-mail box and a ghostly
website. A single employee has been left to wrap
things up." Yeah, it's a mournful tale
of Gothic neocon nemesis worthy of Faulkner.
Even the "Tehran Times" is kicking the brainiacs
to the curb.</P>

<P>
And because our focus has been on
community-based strategic planning, not central
planning, our team has also included neighborhood
activists, public interest advocates, labor leaders,
and others from the private and non-profit sectors.
<span class="bluetext">((("Labor leaders"? Wow.)))</span></P>

<P>Some of our partners serve on our Sustainability
Advisory Board, while others have played a more
informal role. With help from all of them, we've
studied every part of the city.</P>

<P>We've looked at every playground &ndash; all 1,310 of them,
 and identified which neighborhoods will need more
of them going forward. We've rated the age and
efficiency of all 25 of the power plants serving the city &ndash; through 2030. <span class="bluetext">(((Boy, I bet that study
 wasn't pretty.)))</span></P>

<P>We've estimated which of our nearly 250 miles of
subway routes will be congested on an average day
in 2030. <span class="bluetext">(((Wow.)))</span> We have, in short, tried to
anticipate every physical barrier our communities will experience to maintaining &ndash; and building on &ndash;
 the quality of life we enjoy today. And the process
has given us a new, deeper, and sobering appreciation
of the magnitude of the challenges New Yorkers face.
<span class="bluetext">(((You know what I like best about this technocratic
dream-pitch, so far? He hasn't said anything
"faith-based." Kinda refreshing, isn't it?)))</span></P>

<P>THREE MAJOR CHALLENGES</P>

<P>Through our work, we've identified three major
challenges our city will face over the next 25 years:
First, we will be getting bigger. By 2030, projections
show that our city will add nearly one million more
people, along with millions of additional tourists
and three-quarters of a million new jobs.</P>

<P>Second, our infrastructure will be getting older &ndash;
 more than a century old in many places. And it will
be under increasing pressure.</P>

<P>And third, as our population grows and our infrastructure ages, our environment &ndash; our air,
water, and land &ndash; will be pushed to new and
 possibly precarious limits. <span class="bluetext">(((Nothing about the
soaring New York temperatures and rising seas yet.
But just you wait and see.)))</span></P>

<P>Today, we'll share what we've learned over the past
11 months. We'll also present 10 aggressive but achievable goals that we've developed &ndash; with the
 help of our extraordinary team of policymakers and
advisors. They're our goals for making New York a
sustainable city by 2030.</P>


<P>We'll also launch the next stage of this process:
Developing, with extensive public input, a detailed
action plan to create a sustainable future for our
city. A process that we are calling 'Plan-Y-C.'
<span class="bluetext">(((It's a pun. Okay?)))</span></P>


<P>Informed by that process, three months from now we'll
present New Yorkers with specific proposals for
reaching each of our goals, explaining in full the
regulation, legislation, financing mechanisms, or
other measures they will require. And then we'll
reach out to our partners in every branch and at
every level of government to begin turning those
goals into realities.</P>
<OL type="1" start="1"><li value="1">A rising population</li></OL>

The engine driving New York's future is growth &ndash;
 growth that's evident all around us. It seems
wherever you walk in our city these days, whether
it's Kingsbridge Heights or Lower Manhattan, Queens
West or <span class="bluetext">(((etc etc)))</span>, there's new housing being
built. Over the last two years, more permits for
housing construction have been issued than at
any time since the early 1970s, and we will need all
of those new units, and more.</P>

<P>Because the Department of City Planning projects that
by 2010, New York will grow by another 200,000 people.
And by 2030, our population will reach more than 9 million &ndash; the equivalent of adding the populations of
 Boston and Miami to the five boroughs. <span class="bluetext">(((I can
easily imagine the population of Miami showing up,
damp suitcases in tow.)))</span></P>

<P>The result is a surge that is taking our population
to new heights, and our city into uncharted waters.
<span class="bluetext">(((Surging, uncharted waters are kinda the new
shoreline-city gameplan.)))</span></P>

<P>This growth could bring incredible benefits: Billions
of dollars in new economic activity will be generated
by new jobs, residents, and visitors.</P>

<P>But growth also presents challenges: It can undermine
neighborhood quality of life, which is why over the
past five years we've rezoned more than 4,000
city blocks in dozens of neighborhoods, to allow for
growth where there's capacity, and preserve community
character when appropriate. Growth can also
bid up housing prices. And with more than a third of
New York City renters already paying more than half
their income on rent, we can't let that pressure on
family budgets grow any worse. <span class="bluetext">((('Mr. Housing Bubble,'
not affiliated with 'Mr. Internet Bubble.')))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Did you ever see that fine New York film, "Soylent
Green?" "The film depicts a dystopia, a Malthusian
catastrophe that takes place  because humanity has
failed to pursue sustainable development and has not
halted population growth. New York City's population
is 40,000,000, with over half unemployed. Global
warming, air pollution and water pollution have
produced a year-round heatwave and a thin yellow
smog in the daytime. Food and fuel resources are
scarce because of animal and plant decimation,
housing is dilapidated and overcrowded,
and widespread government-sponsored euthanasia is
encouraged as a means of reducing overpopulation.")))</span>
<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soylent_Green">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soylent_Green</A></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((So far, so non-dystopian, eh? Despite sci-fi
prognostications, the urban sophisticates of
New York are not yet squatting in abandoned cars and
devouring each other! Happy New Year Big Green
Apple! Big Times Square round of cheers!)))</span></P>

<P>
In response, we've undertaken the largest affordable
housing plan of any city in the nation, one that will
create and preserve affordable housing for 500,000</P>

New Yorkers by 2013 &ndash; that's more people than live
 in Atlanta, Georgia. But we know even it won't
be enough.</P>

<P>Population growth also increases the need for more
of the parks and playgrounds that families depend on,
even as the competition for land becomes more intense.
We have added 300 acres of parkland over the past five
years, yet more than 100 neighborhoods still do not
have enough playgrounds for the children who live
there.</P>

<P>Our growing population also presents transportation
challenges. Strong leadership and major investments
over the past 25 years have made our subways cleaner
and safer today than they've been in decades. But, as a result, ridership has soared &ndash; making some
 commutes more of an 'up close and personal' experience
than we'd like.</P>

<P>In short, growth is a challenge that can produce great
benefits, but only if we prepare for it and guide it &ndash; so that our city stays as open and welcoming as
 ever. Our population is expected to reach undreamed-of
levels. This poses enormous new challenges, and to
meet them, we've set these three goals:</P>

<P>Creating enough housing for almost a million more
people, and finding even more creative ways to make
housing more affordable for more New Yorkers.</P>

<P>Ensuring that even as land becomes more scarce, every
New Yorker lives within a 10-minute walk of a park,
so that every child has the chance to play and be
active.  And &ndash; so congestion doesn't bring our economy
 grinding to a halt, adding to the capacity of our
regional mass transit system, so that travel times stay the same &ndash; or get better.
<OL type="1" start="2"><li value="2">Aging Infrastructure</LI></OL>

<P>Our growing New York will always be the most diverse
city on earth. <span class="bluetext">((((Uh, maybe.)))</span> It will
remain a magnet for artists, entrepreneurs, and
ambitious immigrants from every corner of the globe.
But despite our dramatically varying backgrounds
and ambitions, we'll share so many common experiences
as New Yorkers. For starters, we will all go about
our days confident in and, in most cases, taking for
granted, the systems that underpin this exceptional
city.</P>


<P>For example, think about what you did to get here
this morning. Maybe your alarm went off; you turned
on the lamp; you ran some water to brush your
teeth; picked up the paper, which had been delivered
by truck; for breakfast you made some toast; took a
phone call (from a Deputy Mayor, telling you not
to mess up a big speech you were going to give in
Queens) <span class="bluetext">(((har har, good one)))</span>; made yourself
some hot coffee; then hopped on the subway to get here.</P>

<P>In other words, you relied on the City's infrastructure &ndash; without ever giving it a single thought. <span class="bluetext">(((No,
 not even when the snow failed to fall and trees
were blooming in December.)))</span> Its millions of
components must work seamlessly, every second, day
after day, year after year, for all of us to survive.
And, for the most part, they do.</P>

<P>That's a testament to the genius of visionaries like
Thomas Edison <span class="bluetext">((("Grandfather of the Greenhouse")))</span>,
to the skill and muscle of sandhogs who blasted
subway and water tunnels through 400 million-year-old
bedrock, and to all those who engineered and built our
brilliant city. But even their amazing achievements
can't outlast the ravages of time.</P>

<P>We're a city that runs on electricity, yet some of our
power grid dates from the 1920s, and our power plants
rely heavily on outmoded, heavily-polluting technology.
<span class="bluetext">(((Yep! Preach it, Your Honor!)))</span></P>

<P>Our subway system and highway networks are extensive,
and heavily-used, yet nearly 3,000 miles of our roads,
bridges, and tunnels, and the majority of our subway
stations are in need of repair. And even though we
have invested hundreds of millions of dollars to
improve our sewer infrastructure over the past 15
years, at the current pace a full upgrade will take
another 500 years. (And hopeful as I am for a long
and happy life, even I don't expect to see that day!)</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Imagine if some tech-mogul dropped by at the Queens
Art Museum and said, "Thanks to my private investments
in telomeres, I confidently expect to live another
500 years, so it's time for you proles to get
cracking and build me the city I deserve." Would
it really <STRONG>surprise</STRONG> you if that happens in another 25
years? Me neither.)))</span></P>

<P>By 2030, virtually every major infrastructure system
in our city will be more than a century old, and
pushed to its limits. It doesn't have to come
to that if we act. Once, infrastructure solutions
were pioneered in New York. Now, it's time for us
to rise to the challenge again, with a new
commitment to upgrading and maintaining New York's
infrastructure.</P>

<P>Achieving sustainability for our growing city means protecting its foundation &ndash; our infrastructure. And
 to do that, we've set these three goals <span class="bluetext">(((the guy
always speaks in threes; this is the third time
he's said that)))</span>:</P>


<P>Developing critical back-up systems for our water
network, so every New Yorker is assured of a
dependable source of water even into the next
century.</P>


<P>Reaching a full state of good repair for New York
City's roads, subways, and rails for the first time
in history.</P>


<P>And providing cleaner, more reliable power for every
New Yorker by upgrading our energy infrastructure.
<span class="bluetext">(((Imagine if he actually achieved that. Lord knows
nobody else ever has. Why would we even have
political parties? Wouldn't we just sell the
planet to the private sector?)))</span></P>

<OL type="1" start="3"><LI VALUE="3"> Strain on the Environment</LI></OL>

<P>In addition to a surging population and a
straining infrastructure, we also face the challenge
of preserving and 'greening' an increasingly embattled
urban environment. The good news is:</P>

<P>We've already taken major steps in the right direction. Exhibit A is our Solid Waste Management Plan, which &ndash;
 thanks to the active support of the League of</P>

<P>Conservation Voters &ndash; Speaker Quinn and the City
 Council passed earlier this year. It was the most
dramatic environmental victory New Yorkers have
achieved in decades, one that will increase
recycling, and also completely end our Sanitation
Department's use of heavily polluting, diesel-burning
long-haul trucks. <span class="bluetext">(((I like it that he actually
<STRONG>starts with the trash.</STRONG> You know, you kinda have
to. New York, like all great cities, is a giant engine
for creating and spreading trash. Okay, so turn
it into something different.)))</span></P>

<P>Nor is that an isolated achievement. In the past five
years, City agencies have cut their greenhouse gas
emissions by more than 350,000 tons a year.
<span class="bluetext">(((Starting in 2007, it's time to stop emphasizing
"cuts" and "reductions" in greenhouse gases and
bending deadly-serious effort to removing the
gases that are already up there. We're not going
to manage at all well in a world whose weather
is as dangerously chaotic as today's weather.
No more Australia? That's too high a price to pay!)))</span></P>

<P>We've made far-sighted investments that will protect
the purity of the water we drink. And not far from
here, we're turning the site of the old Elmhurst gas tanks into a beautiful new park &ndash; just one
 example of how we're reclaiming former industrial
sites for open space and housing. <span class="bluetext">((("The ruins
of the unsustainable are the new frontier.")))</span></P>

<P>"But the demands of our growing population require
us to do far more to protect our environment.
Despite the gains we have made over the past two
decades our aging sewer network still discharges
two billion gallons of sewage into our waterways
every year. Even though we have cleaned hundreds
of acres of brownfields across the city, there is
still much more contaminated land waiting to be
reclaimed for new jobs, housing, and parks. <span class="bluetext">(((Boy,
I know I sure want a Brownfield Brownstone in Dioxin
Memorial Park.)))</span></P>

<P>Our air is cleaner now than it was for much of the
20th Century, yet we have one of the highest asthma
hospitalization rates in the country, and its
effects are most severe for young children in
neighborhoods with high poverty rates. Meanwhile,
we've all noticed that the weather seems to be
getting more unpredictable, and summers seem to be
getting hotter. <span class="bluetext">(((YAY! <STRONG>Stormy applause</STRONG>)))</span></P>

<P>And longer. Well, that's not just a perception;
it's a reality.</P>

<P>It's called global warming but the impact can be local.
We're a coastal city, and the increase of greenhouse
gases in our air is not only lifting temperatures,
it may also be contributing to our rising sea level.
<span class="bluetext">(((Best Christmas present I've had in ages.)))</span></P>

<P>That means that when major storms hit in the future,
the resulting flooding could be worse than anything
we've seen. <span class="bluetext">(((A Republican who isn't stupid! It's
kind of amazing!)))</span></P>

<P>We know the cost of failing to prepare. It can
devastate a great city in just hours, which is why
we have created a comprehensive Coastal Storm Plan.
<span class="bluetext">(((I hope that plan doesn't rely much on the
federal government.)))</span></P>

<P>But to reduce the threat of dangerous storms, it's
also essential that we do our part to dramatically
cut greenhouse gases. To ensure the health of
future generations, and to establish New York as a
leader in meeting some of the greatest challenges
of our time, we must do more to green our city.
<span class="bluetext">(((Yes, yes, he's going on and on, but it's music
to my ears.)))</span></P>

<P>If anyone can innovate when it comes to the environment
(or anything else), New York can. And in that spirit,
we've set these four environmental goals <span class="bluetext">(((wow,</P>

four instead of three &ndash; slumbering heads are snapping
 up in the back of the room)))</span>:</P>

<P>Reducing our city's global warming emissions by more
than 30% by 2030, a target we know is achievable
even just using technology that exists today.</P>

<P>Achieving the cleanest air quality of any big city
in America.</P>

<P>Cleaning up all of our contaminated land.</P>

<P>And, finally, opening 90% of our rivers, harbors,
and bays for recreation by reducing water pollution
and preserving our natural areas. <span class="bluetext">(((I hope
the Mayor of San Francisco isn't too upset that this
East Coast guy just walked off with all his clothes.)))</span></P>

<P>A CALL FOR IDEAS</P>

<P>Clearly, we have a lot of hard work ahead of us.
I'm not going to pretend that fulfilling these goals
will be easy. We know that some of the solutions
will be difficult, and some will cost money.</P>

<P>But in a very real sense, the predicament of our
future is also our hope. <span class="bluetext">(((Heck yeah, Mr Mayor.
You pull that stunt off, I'll move over there
myself.)))</span></P>

<P>The very same population growth that intensifies
the challenges we face also offers us the resources
for meeting them, and the means needed to help
achieve sustainability.</P>

Doing nothing has its costs, too &ndash; economic and
 environmental costs that will only escalate with
the passing years. Refusing to saddle our children
with those high costs is what fiscal responsibility
is all about. It's why the discipline we've shown
and the investments we've made for the past five
years have given us a strong foundation to face our
future.<BR>
<span class="bluetext">(((Yeah, in a day with no more cheap power,</P>

you pretty much go broke either way &ndash; but if you
 manage to knock it off with the oil and coal, the
sky might remain the same color. Plus, you get to
have an Australia!)))</span></P>

<P>To address the challenges before us, we'll seek
the cooperation of policymakers at every
level of government including the Governor-elect
<span class="bluetext">(((that would be Governor-elect Eliot Spitzer, the
white-knight scourge of corruption and a real
hell-on-wheels operator who makes Texan governors
look like some caste of primitive amphibian beings:)))</span>
Link:<BR>
<br><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliot_Spitzer">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eliot_Spitzer</A> and our regional partners.</P>

<P>And the really creative solutions to our problems
are especially likely to come from the private sector,
<span class="bluetext">((((heaven knows I did)))</span> or from non-profit
organizations, or from community leaders who are
determined to make a difference. We want to hear
all of those voices. And we need to.</P>

<P>That's why we are going to conduct a major public
outreach effort over the next few months, to solicit
ideas, get feedback, and build toward consensus.
Today, we are launching that citywide conversation.
<span class="bluetext">(((I wonder if he'll print his own version of
WORLDCHANGING when he piles all those creative
ideas into a heap.)))</span></P>

<P>In fact, the first discussion will take place right
here on this stage. We have assembled an
impressive panel of experts representing a broad
spectrum of disciplines and opinions. And now it's
my pleasure to introduce the moderator for this
discussion, a long-time resident of our City who
loves it as much as his native South Dakota and
who believes in its power to innovate and inspire.</P>

<P>Please welcome a great New Yorker &ndash; and a good
friend &ndash; Tom Brokaw.</P>
