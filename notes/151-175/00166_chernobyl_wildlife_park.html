<P>Attention Conservation Notice:  Some particularly detailed
reportage on the green fate of a nuclear catastrophe area.</P>

<P>(((The concept of "Viridian involuntary parks" has been
explored in Notes 00023, 00057, and 00128.  An
"involuntary park" is best described as an area of the
planet which has returned to savagery due to breakdowns in
technological instrumentalism.  Some good examples are the
Korean demilitarized zone, the Green Line in Cyprus,
certain especially toxic waste sites, and various military
sacrifice zones that are rife with unexploded ammunition.
Then there is the premier example of Chernobyl (or, as it
is spelled by its Ukrainian inheritors, "Chornobyl").
Chernobyl is still a working power plant.  Its last
reactor will be shut down on December 15, 02000, thanks to
a $78 million fee from the USA.  In July 02000 in Berlin,
donors from 40 countries are expected to scare up $700
million to rebuild the concrete "sarcophagus" around the
carcass of the exploded reactor.)))</P>

<P>"Nature thrives in Chernobyl, scene of the world's most
devastating nuclear accident"
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By Steve Connor, Science Editor</P>

<P>"Chernobyl, the scene of the world's worst nuclear
accident, has defied the gloomiest of prophesies by
becoming one of Europe's richest wildlife habitats,
teeming with endangered species.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The evacuation of tens of thousands of residents
living in the 30km exclusion zone around the Ukrainian
reactor has resulted in a flourishing community of plants
and animals whose diversity has stunned biologists.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Radioactive fallout from the explosion and fire
contaminated 2,800sq km of Ukraine and Belarus, which
resulted in the evacuation of 135,000 people and 35,000
cattle and left dozens of towns and villages deserted.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Although the exclusion zone has been subjected to
some of the worst radioactive contamination in history,
life in all its forms has proved to be remarkably
resistant to the known biological effects of radiation,
notably mutations and birth deformities.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Scientists studying the site from the 
International
Radioecology Laboratory just outside the zone have
reported a startling return of many rare species to the
area and a general increase in the diversity of many wild
plants and animals. (...)
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Large European mammals, such as moose, wild boar,
roe and red deer, beavers, wolves, badgers, otters and
lynx have become well established within the zone, while
species associated with man == such as rats, house
mice, sparrows and pigeons - have declined. Michail
Bondarkov, the director of the laboratory, said that 48
endangered species listed in the international Red Book of
protected animals and plants are now thriving in
the Chernobyl exclusion zone.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Of the 270 species of birds in the area, 180 
species
are breeding == the rest being migrants that are passing
through. Breeding birds include the rare green crane,
black stork, white-tailed sea eagle and fish hawk.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Freshwater fish, such as carp, pike, roach and 
perch,
are also thriving, Dr Bondarkov said. The scientists have
even recorded a rich community of aquatic wildlife living
in one of the contaminated cooling ponds at the Chernobyl
site.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Asked if there was any evidence that wild animals 
had
suffered long-term declines since the accident or whether
the scientists had detected any increase in birth defects,
Dr Bondarkov replied: 'Such evidence does not
exist.' (...)
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Jim Smith, a radioecologist from the Centre for
Ecology and Hydrology in Dorchester, who is monitoring
Chernobyl contamination in British sheep, said the latest
findings on the exclusion zone were surprising and had
demonstrated how important the site has become for
understanding ecology.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'We've not really made any hard decisions about 
what
to do with the exclusion zone. I don't think people will
live there for decades. I'd like to see something positive
done with it, possibly by creating a permanent wildlife
reserve,' Dr Smith said.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'It is a unique area and we don't really have
anywhere like it in western Europe. It would be good to
see it protected.'"</P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The joint project between Ukrainian and U.S.
scientists is an outgrowth of research directed by Dr. Ron
Chesser, a senior research scientist and genetics
professor at the University of Georgia's Savannah River
Ecology Laboratory (SREL) in Aiken.(...)
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Chesser has studied the effects of the Chernobyl
accident on wildlife since 1992. Chesser says, 'The
unfortunate accident at Chernobyl has created one of the
world's most unique and vital experimental regions. We
have involved nationally and internationally renowned
scientists to evaluate the environmental and genetic
impacts of the Chernobyl accident. Researchers from the
University of Georgia, Texas Tech University, Oklahoma
State University, Illinois State Museum, Texas A&amp;M, and
Colorado State as well as Ukraine and Russia have been
actively involved in our research programs there. (...)
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Hopefully, our work can dispel many myths 
associated
with life in radioactive environments. When most people
think of Chernobyl, they envision a nuclear desert with
two-headed frogs, giant worms, and creatures like Godzilla
wandering about. We see none of that. There are no
monsters. The Chernobyl zone is actually a very beautiful
place with thriving wildlife communities. Without a
Geiger-counter, you wouldn't know you were in a highly
contaminated place. Thus far, our genetic studies have
shown very few long-lasting impacts due to the high
radiation. Most of the effects, however, are very subtle
and require precise and intensive methods to uncover.
While some effects are obvious, such as large tracts of
dead pine trees, and over one hundred abandoned villages
and towns, the legacy of environmental radiation, such as
that released by Chernobyl, is definitely not a nuclear
desert."</P>
