Attention Conservation Notice:  It's  corporate propaganda
from a major car manufacturer and a green electric utility
owned by a Republican.  It's stuffy, self-serving and
boring.  This is the Viridian victory-condition. If we get
this kind of news on a massive scale worldwide, that means
that we win.

"Toyota Goes 'Greener' With Green Mountain Energy(SM)
<P>
"SAN FRANCISCO, Calif., May 23, 02000
GreenMountain.com and Toyota Motor Sales (TMS), U.S.A.,
Inc., have signed an agreement under which the auto
company will purchase Green Mountain Energy(SM) renewable
power.  The agreement, one of the largest commercial
'green' energy contracts in California, is effective
immediately.
<P>
<P>
"'We are pleased to announce that Toyota has enhanced
their commitment to changing the way power is made.  They
are purchasing 100% renewable Green Mountain Energy(SM)
power blend that includes at least 5% 'new' wind power
from three new turbines in San Gorgonio, Calif.,
specifically developed last year to serve
GreenMountain.com customers,' said Julie Blunden, western
regional president of GreenMountain.com.  'To have a
company like Toyota take the next step and choose to
support 'new' wind generation, demonstrates a real
commitment on their part by taking small but important
first steps towards a cleaner environment.'
<P>
<P>
"'Toyota has been a pioneer in environmental
responsibility throughout every facet of the planning,
design, research, manufacturing, sales and service of our
vehicles,' said Jim Press, TMS executive vice president.
'Development of our all-new Prius hybrid vehicle, on sale
this summer, is one example of this responsibility, and
utilizing renewable power from GreenMountain Energy(SM) is
yet another.' (...)
<P>
<P>
"As one of the first automotive companies to make a
commitment to purchase renewable power, Toyota estimates
that the annual usage under the contract to be 40 million
kWh of renewable energy, which is equal to the amount of
power used annually by 6,060 average California homes.
<P>
<P>
"GreenMountain.com began offering a cleaner energy
choice to California consumers in 1998.  Since that time,
the company has dedicated itself to making consumers aware
that the number one industrial cause of air pollution in
the U.S. is the generation of electricity. In response to
the increased demand for cleaner energy choices,
GreenMountain.com has spurred the development of three new
wind turbines and two new solar facilities in California.
<P>
<P>
"The wind Toyota is purchasing comes from the three
new 750 kW wind turbines located in the San Gorgonio Pass
near Palm Springs that became operational in June 1999.
These wind turbines were the first new sources of
renewable energy built as a direct result of customer
choice.  California-based residential consumers can
support new wind by switching to a power blend called
'Wind for the Future(SM)' which supports 25% new wind
generation.
<P>
<P>
"On April 10 of this year, GreenMountain.com
introduced a new power blend called  'Solar for the
Future(SM)', the first 100% renewable power blend in the
nation that specifically supports the development of new
solar facilities. (...)
<P>
<P>
"The Toyota contract is the most recent addition to
the growing list of California commercial customers
choosing Green Mountain Energy(SM) renewable energy
blends.  Those customers include Kinkos, Birkenstock, the
Episcopal Diocese of California (which includes 26
individual churches including historic Grace Cathedral in
San Francisco) and Real Goods Trading Co of Ukiah."
