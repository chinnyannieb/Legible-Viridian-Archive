"A-Bomb Birthplace Burns Down
<P>
<P>
"LOS ALAMOS, N.M. (Reuters)  A complex of historic
buildings where scientists assembled the first atomic bomb
during World War Two has been consumed by a wildfire that
has raged for over a week, the Los Alamos National
Laboratory said on Monday.
<P>
<P>
"The complex where scientists worked on the top-
secret Manhattan Project to build the bomb was destroyed
in the fire except for one building, the laboratory said
in a statement.
<P>
<P>
"Laboratory official Ternel Martinez said the
destruction of the site was a severe blow to the 12,000
people who work at the U.S. nuclear weapons research
facility in northern New Mexico.
<P>
<P>
"'Any time that anything of historical significance
is lost it's a great tragedy,' he told Reuters. 'We're
very proud of our past and anything that we could have
kept to show the world our significant contribution to
ending World War Two... whenever you lose that, it's very
painful.'
<P>
<P>
(...)  "Officials have also warned that the blaze,
which started as a controlled burn to clear scrub bush,
could burn for several more weeks. (...)"

"WASHINGTON (AP) == A malfunction in a steam pipeline
has forced officials at the Chernobyl nuclear power plant
in Ukraine to cut power back 50 percent, even as forest
fires spread the remnants of radiation from a 1986
disaster at the plant, a U.S. official said Wednesday.
(...)
<P>
"There is no evidence of radiation as a result of
the malfunction, the official told The Associated Press.
<P>
<P>
"But, at the same time, the official said, forest
fires in the area had caused the circulation into the air
of remnants of radiation in roots and stems of plants,
with the result that the radiation level in Kiev was
elevated slightly. (...)
<P>
<P>
"A cover for the plant was built after the disaster,
but it is considered unstable. Some $360 million, in
addition to 400 million already raised, is needed for the
new cover.
<P>
<P>
"The Chernobyl disaster caused an estimated 4,000
deaths among those who took part in the cleanup and 70,000
people were disabled by radiation, according to Ukrainian
government data."
