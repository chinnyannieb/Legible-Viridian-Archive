<P>"FEMA director warns of more severe natural disasters"</P>

<P>By RANDOLPH E. SCHMID, Associated Press</P>

<P>"WASHINGTON (May 24, 2000 10:43 a.m. EDT
<A HREF="http://www.nandotimes.com">http://www.nandotimes.com</A>) == Preaching a gospel of
preparation and prevention for Americans, Federal
Emergency Management Agency Director James Lee
Witt said Tuesday that natural disasters are getting
more frequent and more severe.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Tornado activity, we see now, normally starts in the
spring of the year, is starting in January. Hurricane
seasons seem like they're much more intense,' Witt
told editors and reporters of The Associated Press.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'We will see,' he said, from 'what the scientists
tell us, some extremely devastating events in the 21st
century.'"</P>

<P>(((Why would James Lee Witt say such a thing?  Do you
suppose he's merely angling for expanded FEMA funding?
Why no!  It seems rather more likely that, like the
President and the Secretary of State, FEMA reads the
climate briefings from NOAA:)))</P>

<P>"YEAR TO DATE: HOT AND DRY == FORECAST: HOT AND DRY</P>

<P>By Cat Lazaroff</P>

<P>"WASHINGTON, DC, May 22, 2000 (ENS) == The four month
period of January through April this year was the warmest
such period on record in the United States, the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) said Friday.
(...)
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"This was the warmest January through April in 106
years of record keeping, according to statistics
calculated by NOAA's scientists working from the world's
largest statistical weather database. NOAA's National
Climatic Data Center in Asheville, North Carolina, holds
data from record keeping that goes back to 1894.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The preliminary data indicate that almost 70 percent
of the U.S. was much warmer than normal, while less than
one percent of the country was much cooler than normal.
(...)
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The American southwest has been struck by a rash of
wildfires in recent weeks, with one blaze sweeping the
north rim of the Grand Canyon and another threatening the
nation's largest nuclear weapons lab in Los Alamos, New
Mexico. (...)
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Increasing signs of global warming prompted U.S.
President Bill Clinton to use a speech to the Democratic
Leadership Council on Sunday to promote U.S. action on
climate change.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Every member of Congress here will tell you that a
huge portion of decision makers in our country and
throughout the world ==  and most troubling, in some of
the biggest developing nations == still believe you cannot
have economic growth unless you pour more greenhouse gases
into the atmosphere,' Clinton said. 'There is nothing so
dangerous as for a people to be in the grip of a big idea
that is no longer true. It was once true that you had to
put more greenhouse gases into the atmosphere to grow the
economy, to build a middle class, make a country rich. It
is not true anymore.'
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Clinton warned that the U.S. must take the lead on
addressing climate change and other environmental problems
to persuade other countries to do the same.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'There's no way in the world we'll be able to
convince our friends in India or China, which over the
next 30 years will become bigger emitters of greenhouse
gases than we are, that they can take a different path to
development, and that we're not trying to keep them poor,
unless we can demonstrate that we have let this idea go
and that we have evidence that a different way will work,'
said Clinton. (...)
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In 1999, the U.S. experienced one of its worst
droughts ever recorded. Almost two thirds of the country
suffered severe and persistent heat waves, killing 257
Americans and thousands of cattle in July alone.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;(...) "Just last week, the National Weather Service
released a forecast calling for a significant drought
across much of the U.S. this summer.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In April, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright
proposed the creation of a global alliance for water
security, warning that the squeeze on global water
resources will tighten as populations grow, demand
increases, pollution continues and climate change
accelerates.

States and the globe are available at:"
