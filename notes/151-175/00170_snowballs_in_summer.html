<P>(((Andy Goldsworthy, a major British artist whom we
Viridians adore, is putting on a live webcam event right
now in downtown London!  Amazed civilians are watching
giant snowballs melt in their public streets!)))</P>

<P>"ANDY GOLDSWORTHY LIVE on <A HREF="http://www.eyestorm.com/">www.eyestorm.com</A>
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"In a move which exposes a major art project at the
Barbican Centre to an immediate world wide audience,
online art innovators eyestorm will be broadcasting Andy
Goldsworthy's Snowballs in Summer live on the world wide
web.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Visitors can watch three of the thirteen giant
snowballs from pre-millennium Scotland melt away on a
midsummer's day in the city of London and the reactions of
passers-by as wood, stone, berries, Highland cow hair and
chalk are slowly exposed when the snow melts in the heat
of the city.</P>

<P>"SNOWBALLS IN SUMMER
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"'Snowballs in Summer' occurs on 21 June: Midsummer's
Day. Thirteen giant snowballs will be placed on the
streets of London, left to melt in the heat of the longest
day. As they disappear they will leave behind the
materials that Andy Goldsworthy packed into the snow
sculptures: sheep's wool, crow feathers, chestnut seeds,
ash seeds, Scots pine cones, elderberries, barley, metal,
barbed wire, branches, chalk, pebbles and highland cow
hair.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Goldsworthy has chosen some very public locations for
the snowballs near Barbican and Moorgate underground
stations; these will confront thousands of workers on
their way to the City. Other snowballs will be hidden in
locations to be discovered by chance.  (((Wow!))) Some of
the materials within the snowballs will resonate with
their locations: for example the ones which contain
Highland cow hair and sheep's wool will be sited near
Smithfield Market, drawing a relationship between the
place of the snowballs' construction == near Goldsworthy's
home in Scotland == and the oldest meat market in London.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The project is time-based, with the snowballs
expected to take between three and five days to melt.
Another important factor in the work is the interaction
with the public, as surprised Londoners encounter the
frozen sculptures.  You can see the melting snowballs live
on the web."</P>
