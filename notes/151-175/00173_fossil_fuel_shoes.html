<P>"Gas-Powered Shoes in Russia</P>

<P>By ANDREW KRAMER  Associated Press Writer

<P>"MOSCOW (AP) == His fashion sense isn't as elegant as<BR>
Gucci's, but Roman Kunikov says his gasoline-powered boots<BR>
are a step forward in footwear == as much as 13 feet per<BR>
stride.<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<BR>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"Kunikov is one of the professors at a Russian
engineering institute who designed the boots that were
tested Tuesday in a public square in Ufa, 750 miles
southeast of Moscow.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The test showed that wearers can achieve speeds of
up to 25 mph, Kunikov said in a telephone interview.
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The boots incorporate one-foot pistons that strap
along the calf and fire downward after the wearer steps</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>down, pushing a metal plate away from the bottom of the<BR>
shoe == and the wearer up into the air.<BR></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<BR>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The shoe works in a rhythm with the wearer's step.
As he steps down, his body weight resets the piston, which
then fires and pushes him on his way. The plate is
connected to the sole of the shoe by metal rods that work
as shock absorbers. The shoes use ordinary gasoline,
Kunikov said.  (...)
<BR></P>

<P>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;"The shoes weigh about two pounds each, including a
fuel tank, tiny carburetor, spark plug and wires and
pipes. Kunikov said there have not been any accidents so
far."</P>
