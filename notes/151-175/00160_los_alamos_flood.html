"Los Alamos now faces flood threat
<P>
"LOS ALAMOS, N.M., May 22 ==  Scourged by fire, the town
that gave birth to the atomic bomb now faces a threat from
water. New Mexico¹s worst wildfire left the mountains
around Los Alamos prone to flash floods ahead of the rainy
season.
<P>
<P>
"Emergency officials warned the wildfire had created
a new danger == summer flash floods in late June or July,
when heavy rains usually fall on northern New Mexico.
(...)
<P>
<P>
"The wildfire burned much of the forest underbrush
that normally slows water running off the mountainsides
and glazed the top layer of soil into a surface that sheds
water, said Ken Palmrose, spokesman for a multi-agency
Burned Area Emergency Recovery team surveying the damage.
<P>
<P>
"As a result, the summer rains could send powerful
torrents down the canyons and arroyos that cut through Los
Alamos, potentially flooding roads, undermining bridges
and carving new watercourses through property.
<P>
<P>
"Los Alamos county has warned fire-weary residents
of the flood danger and urged people to keep a three-day
survival kit at home in case their neighborhoods are cut
off.
<P>
<P>
(...) "The burn recovery team was mapping the
expected danger spots and would draw up recommendations as
early as this week for preventing floods, including
erecting barriers of hay bales or mesh and crisscrossing
fallen trees on the mountainsides to slow the rush of
rainwater. (...)
<P>
<P>
"The clouds were part of a cool front with spotty
showers over the weekend that helped firefighters make
progress in the final stage of containing the blaze, which
has consumed 47,650 acres == and 200 homes == since it
started."  (((Note that this is a mere 200 homes burned,
as opposed to earlier reports of 400.)))
<P>
<P>
"'We're all just kind of numb. The reality is just
sinking in,' Los Alamos resident Pat Minor said as he
picked up cleaning supplies and snacks from a Red Cross
emergency station. Minor's house suffered smoke damage but
the one next door was burnt to the ground.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
  "The fire is 90 percent contained. The final front is
</BLOCKQUOTE>
expected to be hemmed in by Wednesday, although it will
continue smoking and burning in spots within the perimeter
until the summer rains fall.
<P>
<P>
"On Sunday, smoke rose from behind one of the peaks
over Los Alamos as people in the worst-hit neighborhoods
that abut the mountains drove by a Red Cross emergency
truck to pick up free lunches and gloves, goggles, buckets
and brooms for clearing away smoke and fire damage.
<P>
<P>
"'Nobody has time to worry about the rains,' said
Rosemary O¹Connor, who has lived in Los Alamos since 1947.
Her one-story brick house escaped damaged on a street
where others were charred, but she was collecting cleaning
supplies anyway because everything in her refrigerator and
freezer had gone bad after days without power.
<P>
<P>
"Her neighborhood was spotted with big signs in front
yards thanking firefighters for saving the homes they
could. People around town wore green ribbons or flew them
from their cars and trucks as a sign of thanks to all
emergency workers."   (((Look at that, folks.  Post-
enviro-disaster "green ribbons."  Get used to them:
American pop  culture is one of the most supple and
adaptive in the world. One minor caveat here. Do you
suppose it's possible to <strong>trigger</strong> mudslides by
<b>attempting to prevent</b> them?  This is, after all, Los
Alamos, where people prepare to incinerate civilization in
order to save it.)))
<P>
<P>

nuclear superpower:)))

"FOREST FIRES IN SIBERIA COMES CLOSE TO RADIOACTIVE
MATERIALS. A forest fire in Irkutsk Oblast approached a
nuclear storage facility, NTV reported on 20 May.
According to the station, the fire came near the Radon
company, which stores radioactive substances in special
concrete bunkers. The station reported that there is a
shortage of personnel and equipment, particularly
telecommunications equipment, to fight the forest fires.
Authorities reported earlier in the month that the
situation was critical in eastern Irkutsk, where the
number of fires doubled in one week (see "RFE/RL
Newsline," 17 May 2000)."
