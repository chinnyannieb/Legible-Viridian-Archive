<P>WHO IS THE BUCKMINSTER FULLER OF THE INTERNET?
Doors of Perception 6 on 'lightness'
11,12,13 November 2000
http:www.doorsofperception.com</P>

<P>Registration has opened for Doors of Perception 6, the
international conference that sets design agendas for the
internet. The theme this year is lightness.</P>

<P>Buckminster Fuller investigated 'ephemeralisation' in the
1930s == the design approach of doing more, using less
matter.</P>

<P>Who, in an age of obese software, and energy-guzzling
industrial systems, is Bucky Fuller's equal as an
innovator today? Your suggestions are welcome (see below).
Speakers already confirmed for November are:</P>

<P>MALCOM MCCULLOUGH, the author of Abstracting Craft; he
will contrast 'anytime/anyplace' communications with
design for location awareness.</P>

<P>WINY MAAS, of MVRDV, the architect of the Dutch pavilion
at Expo2000, and author of Far_max:excursions on density.</P>

<P>ADRIAAN BEUKERS,the author of Lightness; he will explore
the way  biomimicry and the synergy of multiple materials
makes lightness work.</P>

<P>MAYA DRAISIN and TIFFANY SHLAIN, who organise the Webbys,
the 'Oscars of the internet', will review the best of this
year's Webby winners.</P>

<P>HANI RASHID, principal of Asymptote in New York, will
explore, with stunning examples, how hybrid real and
virtual spaces are co-evolving.</P>

<P>ALEXANDER ROSE, director of The Long Now Foundation, will
talk about the Rosetta Disk project == a melding of
digital tools for analog storage.</P>

<P>ENG LOCK LEE, of SuperSymmetry Services, in Singapore, is
"the world's master of the new design mentality in fluid
handling" (Paul Hawken).</P>

<P>SUGATA MITRA, from the Centre for Cognitive Systems in
Bombay, will describe what illiterate street children do
with internet access.</P>

<P>BRUCE STERLING, the writer and critic, is also leader of
the Viridians == an online discussion community that
connects 'eco' and 'info'.</P>

<P>MICHAEL DOUGLAS, an Australian designer, has spent three
years developing 'Tramjatra', a project to do with
Calcutta, trams, and lightness.</P>

<P>IVO JANSSEN, the pianist who wowed Doors 4 on 'speed.'
will explore lightness through the music of Dutch composer
SIMEON TEN HOLT.</P>
