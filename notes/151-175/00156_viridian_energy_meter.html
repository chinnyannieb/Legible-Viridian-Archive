"Give Me Feedback And I Will Change The World, Or At
Least My Own Habits
<P>
"This column is not a Honda ad, though it will start
off  sounding like one. This is an ad for feedback.
<P>
"I've had a Honda gas-electric hybrid car for less
than a  month. It has taught me a whole new way of
driving, thanks to feedback from its  instrument panel.
<P>
"An indicator flashes a string of orange lights when
the  nickel-hydride batteries kick in to help the little
gas engine accelerate or pull uphill. When I decelerate or
go downhill, green lights show the gas engine recharging
the batteries. Light brake pressure sends the meter to a
green maximum. So now I avoid sudden stops. I try to glide
into stoplights, braking gently from a long distance away.
<P>
"There are three odometer/mileage meters. One I reset
as I start each trip. One I reset when I fill up with gas.
The third keeps track of miles and mileage overthe life of
the car. At the moment that third meter reads 1600 miles
at an average 56 miles per gallon. The latter number is
rising as the car teaches me to drive more efficiently.
The last fill-up carried me 660 miles at an average 71
miles per gallon. Some days I can get over 80 mpg on my
commute to Dartmouth.
<P>
"The most effective feedback comes from the
instantaneous mileage meter, which zooms up and down
according to my gas consumption at  every minute.
<P>
"Long uphill in third gear: ouch! Under 25 mpg.
Cruising on the flat: not bad, 75 mpg, maybe if I ease off
the gas a bit I can get it up to 80. Long downhill:
shazam! Off the scale at over 150!
<P>
"This meter runs my life, or at least my driving. No
more jackrabbit stops or starts. No way, when I see the
result on the mileage meter, do I gun my engine.  I find
myself going slower than I'm used to. I conform almost
perfectly to speed limits. I pass lurking police cars
without a twinge of apprehension == now there's a new
experience! My commute takes about one minute longer, a
small price to pay for cutting my gas cost in half.
<P>
"The habit I find hardest to shake is driving
according to the urge of the driver behind me. When
someone crowds me impatiently, I used to speed up == but
now I see my mileage drop when I do. For awhile I speeded
up anyway. Then I started thinking, 'why should I
contribute to the frying of the planet just because you're
in a hurry? If you stay at the speed I'm going, both of us
will use less gas.'
<P>
"So now I remain happily oblivious to frustration
behind me. I do try to stick to the interstate, so folks
can pass me, or to take two-lane roads at less busy times.
I notice, to my surprise, that I'm not the only speed-
limit-obeying slowpoke out there. I never quite registered
the others before; I was too busy leaving them in the
dust.
<P>
"Whatever you think of my driving, my point has to do
with the power of feedback. Three weeks of information I
never had before have changed 40 years of ingrained
driving habits. I didn't have to be coerced or rewarded; I
didn't have to change my values. I just had to see how my
actions did and did not conform to my values.
<P>
"Which brings me to the Viridian Meter. There is a
crazy website run by science fiction writer Bruce Sterling
and dedicated to the proposition that industrial design
needs to be more environmentally conscious and less ugly.
The site features catalog ads for imaginary products that
Sterling and his friends think someone should invent. One
of them is the Viridian Meter.
<P>
"'One of the most offensive artifacts of the
twentieth century is the standard household electricity
meter. This ugly gizmo clings like a barnacle to the
outside of your home, readable only by functionaries.
Clumsily painted in battleship gray, this network spy
device features creepy, illegible little clock-dials under
an ungainly glass dome. Look a bit closer and this user-
hostile interface deliberately insults you with a hateful
anti-theft warning and a foul little lockbox.'
<P>
"'This crass device is designed to leave you in
stellar ignorance of your own energy usage. It publicly
brands you as a helpless peon, a technically illiterate
source of cash for remote, uncaring utility lords.
<P>
"'But today, thanks to the Viridian Electrical
Meter, the tables are turned. The Viridian Meter is not
some utility spy device, but a user-owned art object!'
<P>
"I will spare you the description of the Viridian
Meter, because my institute is sponsoring a contest for
the design of an actual one, and I don't want to cramp
your creativity. The ideal meter would be so beautiful or
dynamic or fascinating that you would want it in your
living room. You would watch it rise as someone turns on
an electric hairdryer. You would cheer as more efficient
lightbulbs cool its angry red, say, to soothing green.
Maybe it would read in dollars instead of kilowatt-hours,
so you could watch your electric space heater dribble your
paycheck away. Maybe it would show less acid rain falling
on New England or less greenhouse gas pouring into the
atmosphere as you switch off lights in empty rooms.
<P>
"Whatever a Viridian Meter would look like, I want
one. I want it to teach me, as my new car is teaching me,
the actual effects of my decisions. I want another meter
to register my water use and another the fuel flows I
engender, as I open doors, wash dishes, caulk windows,
take long showers, or buy an efficient washing machine. I
want those meters in my kitchen or on my front door, right
in my face, and I want them posted on a website so
everyone can see them.
<P>
"I suspect that all it would take would be some
well-placed user-friendly feedback to change the world."
<P>
(((Way to go Professor Donella! Her righteously sedate
driving scares up venture funding to create real-life
Viridian products.  Meanwhile, in Japan, "the future is
already here, but it has delivery issues.")))

"MITI Officials Consider 'Real Time' Meter
<P>
"Officials with Japan's Ministry of International Trade
and Industry (MITI) recently announced plans to reduce
energy use in residential buildings and offices.
<P>
"The new measure will include the use of electricity
and natural gas meters that show the actual charges for
consumption in real time.
<P>
"Scientists have already found that the new meters
reduce power consumption by about 20 percent per year.
Because the meters cost about 20,000 yen (about $189) to
install, MITI hopes to utilize government subsidies to
encourage their use.  In addition, MITI may develop a
computer network that would control air conditioners and
other domestic appliances.
<P>
"Under the system, appliances would be automatically
turned off when a building is empty, and temperature
settings would be readjusted to minimize electricity
consumption."
