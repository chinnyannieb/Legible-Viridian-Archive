<P>(((With Chernobyl purportedly shutting down soon, one
might wonder how the Ukraine will manage to obtain useful
energy. The answer?  Steal it from Russian pipelines!)))</P>

<P>"UKRAINIAN PRESIDENT LAMBASTES CABINET FOR ENERGY POLICY.
Leonid Kuchma on 8 June criticized Viktor Yushchenko's
cabinet for failing to regulate the situation in the fuel
and energy sector, Interfax reported. 'No use has been
made of the 11,000 directives from the government
committee on reforming the fuel and energy sector and from
the Ministry of Fuel and Energy,' Kuchma noted (...). He
added that Ukraine has illegally siphoned off 13 billion
cubic meters of Russian gas from pipelines crossing its
territory. Russia has the right to take Ukraine to an
international court over the issue, he commented.
Ukraine's lucrative energy market is widely believed to
provide huge revenues for a few powerful oligarchs who
sell Russian gas at inflated prices."</P>

<P>(((Rumania is suffering intense drought this summer.
Irrigation would bring some relief, but in a marvelous
variant of the Wexelblat Disaster, relief is impossible
because the pipeline infrastructure has been stolen.)))</P>

<P>"ROMANIAN DROUGHT, THEFT DECLARED 'SECURITY THREAT.'
Romania's Supreme Council of National Defense on 13 June
called for 'the immediate and energetic intervention of
the government' to deal with the effects of the drought
that has affected 40 percent of agricultural land in the
country. Damage is estimated at more than $200 million.
President Emil Constantinescu said that the damage is due
not to the drought alone but also to 'generalized theft.'
Many irrigation pipelines have been stolen as well as oil
pipelines, resulting in the threat of a 'large-scale
ecological catastrophe.'"</P>

<P>(((Meanwhile, in luckless Los Alamos, "the Kremlin
of the Southwest,"  that enormous Greenhouse wildfire has
apparently caused them to discover the loss of == wait for
it == Russian nuclear accident files.  Stolen? Lost?
Pawned?  Sacrificed for a Napster hub? Who knows?)))</P>

<P>"RUSSIAN NUCLEAR SECRETS MISSING FROM LOS ALAMOS. Citing
the Website of 'The New York Times,' Western agencies on
12 June reported that the FBI is searching for two hard
drives missing from the Los Alamos nuclear research
laboratory that include classified U.S. and Russian
nuclear information as well as other sensitive data.
According to the newspaper, the hard drives were
discovered to have gone missing from a vault at the
laboratory, which had been evacuated for five days in mid-
May during nearby wildfires. Energy Department officials
first learned about their disappearance at the beginning
of this month. The New York daily also reported that the
hard drives contained data used to respond to nuclear
accidents and terrorist threats as well as information
about Russia's nuclear weapons program."</P>
