  <P>Key concepts: Viridian design contest, magazine covers,<BR>
  graphics</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Attention Conservation Notice: It's yet another in our
series of ongoing Viridian design contests.
<BR></P>

<P>At the end of September 02000, I'll be appearing at the
Texas Renewable Energy festival in Fredericksburg,
Texas.  I'll be speaking there, but I'm also carrying in
a number of attractive, designery, renewable-energy
gizmos and knickknacks that I have made it my business to
collect.  (Some of them will be cunningly-forged "Viridian
imaginary products."  Think anyone will be able to tell
the difference?  Neither do I!)
<BR></P>

<P>Since this is a rare, physical-meatspace appearance by
the Viridian Pope-Emperor, I also plan to take along a
bevy of Viridian Notes, all nicely printed out, just for
once, on archaic dead-tree material.  In other words, a
vanity-press pamphlet of hard-core Viridian propaganda.
This is not a commercial publishing venture. It is a
giveaway outreach effort, kind of a cunning low-rent
forgery of a magazine, which will no  doubt become
fantastically valuable in the collectors' market, once
they come to understand that it was given away to a tiny
group of people for nothing.
<BR></P>

<P>So I'll have to edit it.  Furthermore, I need a cover.
Kind of a "Best of Viridian" laser-color thing, that would
still look okay with a couple of rusty staples through it.
It needs to be in standard American paper size so I can
run them off down at the copy shop at 2 AM when no one is
looking.  I'm not at all particular about the imagery or
the format == you can just use your imagination == but the
cover that is "most Viridian" will take the prize.
<BR></P>

<P>The prize is a copy of "Cover Story: The Art of
American Magazine Covers 1900-1950" by Steven Heller and
Louise Fili, Chronicle Books, 1996.
<BR></P>

<P>Compose your Viridian magazine cover and
put on the web so we can all see it.  Everyone
who enters a Viridian contest receives a lovely
and valuable star &lt;*&gt; for their log-in name.
The deadline is August 31, 02000.  Good luck!</P>
