<h2>
"The Long Emergency</h2>

<P>"What's going to happen as we start running out of
cheap gas to guzzle?<BR>
"By JAMES HOWARD KUNSTLER</P>

<P>"A few weeks ago, the price of oil ratcheted above
fifty-five dollars a barrel, which is about twenty
dollars a barrel more than a year ago. The next day,
the oil story was buried on page six of the New York
Times business section. Apparently, the price of oil
is not considered significant news, even when it
goes up five bucks a barrel in the span of ten days.
That same day, the stock market shot up more than
a hundred points because, CNN said, government data
showed no signs of inflation. Note to clueless
nation: Call planet Earth.  <span class="bluetext">(((What's the problem
here: running out of oil, or NYT page rankings?)))</span></P>

<P>"Carl Jung, one of the fathers of psychology,
famously remarked that 'people cannot stand too
much reality.' What you're about to read may
challenge your assumptions about the kind of world
we live in, and especially the kind of world into
which events are propelling us. We are in for a
rough ride through uncharted territory.
<span class="bluetext">(((Especially if Jung is our guide, because Jung
was bonkers.)))</span></P>

<p>"It has been very hard for Americans &ndash; lost in
  dark raptures of nonstop infotainment, recreational
  shopping and compulsive motoring &ndash; to make sense
  of the gathering forces that will fundamentally
  alter the terms of everyday life in our technological
  society. Even after the terrorist attacks of 9/11,
  America is still sleepwalking into the future.
  I call this coming time the Long Emergency.
  <span class="bluetext">(((I'd like to see the aspects of reality that
  Kunstler thinks Americans <STRONG>can</STRONG> make sense of.
  Are there any American connections to reality
  whatsoever?  They used to be pretty good at...
  I dunno... making cotton gins and combine
  harvesters.)))</span></p>


<P>"Most immediately we face the end of the cheap
fossil-fuel era. It is no exaggeration to state
that reliable supplies of cheap oil and natural
gas underlie everything we identify as the
necessities of modern life &ndash; not to mention
all of its comforts and luxuries: central heating,
air conditioning, cars, airplanes, electric lights,
inexpensive clothing, recorded music, movies,
hip-replacement surgery, national defense &ndash;
you name it.  <span class="bluetext">(((Okay, how about "clean air,"
"biodiversity," "a stable climate" and "potable water"?
I just named four stark necessities of modern life
that have nothing to do with cheap fossil fuel.)))</span></P>

<P>"The few Americans who are even aware that there is
a gathering global-energy predicament usually
misunderstand the core of the argument. That
argument states that we don't have to run out of
oil to start having severe problems with industrial
civilization and its dependent systems. We only
have to slip over the all-time production peak
and begin a slide down the arc of steady depletion.
<span class="bluetext">(((Why is that the "core of the argument"?  It's
like saying that the core of lung cancer is when
the price of cigarettes goes up.)))</span></P>

<P>"The term 'global oil-production peak' means that
a turning point will come when the world produces
the most oil it will ever produce in a given year
and, after that, yearly production will inexorably
decline. It is usually represented graphically in
a bell curve. The peak is the top of the curve,
the halfway point of the world's all-time total
endowment, meaning half the world's oil will be
left. That seems like a lot of oil, and it is,
but there's a big catch: It's the half that is
much more difficult to extract, far more costly
to get, of much poorer quality and located mostly
in places where the people hate us. A substantial
amount of it will never be extracted.</P>

<P>"The United States passed its own oil peak &ndash; about 11 million barrels a day &ndash; in 1970, and since
  then production has dropped steadily. In 2004 it
  ran just above 5 million barrels a day (we get a
  tad more from natural-gas condensates). Yet we
  consume roughly 20 million barrels a day now.
  That means we have to import about two-thirds
  of our oil, and the ratio will continue to worsen.
  </P>

<P>"The U.S. peak in 1970 brought on a portentous
change in geoeconomic power. Within a few years,
foreign producers, chiefly OPEC, were setting the
price of oil, and this in turn led to the oil
crises of the 1970s. In response, frantic
development of non-OPEC oil, especially the
North Sea fields of England and Norway,
essentially saved the West's ass for about two
decades. Since 1999, these fields have entered
depletion. Meanwhile, worldwide discovery of new
oil has steadily declined to insignificant levels
in 2003 and 2004."  <span class="bluetext">(((I'm not gonna quarrel with
these figures, but the "change in geo-economic
power"...  Even if OPEC is regaining pricing power,
can you imagine anything WORSE than being a
citizen in an OPEC country?  Take your choice of
the new power-elite: Iraq, Iran, Nigeria,
Venezuela, Indonesia...)))</span></P>

<P>"Some 'cornucopians' claim that the Earth has
something like a creamy nougat center of 'abiotic'
oil that will naturally replenish the great oil
fields of the world. The facts speak differently.
There has been no replacement whatsoever of oil
already extracted from the fields of America or
any other place.  <span class="bluetext">(((Thomas Gold argues otherwise,
but that's okay...  In my opinion, an infinite
supply of abiotic oil would be ten times scarier
than peak oil.)))</span></P>

<P>"Now we are faced with the global oil-production peak.
The best estimates of when this will actually happen
have been somewhere between now and 2010. In 2004,
however, after demand from burgeoning China and
India shot up, and revelations that Shell Oil
wildly misstated its reserves, and Saudi Arabia
proved incapable of goosing up its production
despite promises to do so, the most knowledgeable
experts revised their predictions and now concur
that 2005 is apt to be the year of all-time global
peak production."  <span class="bluetext">(((Suppose that peak oil really
took place back in 1999.  Would we all collapse now
if experts reassessed the oil-reserve figures and
figured that out?)))</span></P>

<P>"It will change everything about how we live.
<span class="bluetext">(((I hate to say "I'm all for it," but really,
we Americans do need to change most everything
about how we live.  Why not just own up to it and
get right on with the job? Come on, if the Indians
and Chinese can do that, anybody can.)))</span></P>

<P>"To aggravate matters, American natural-gas production
is also declining, at five percent a year, despite
frenetic new drilling, and with the potential of
much steeper declines ahead. Because of the oil
crises of the 1970s, the nuclear-plant disasters
at Three Mile Island and Chernobyl and the acid-rain
problem, the U.S. chose to make gas its first choice
for electric-power generation. The result was that
just about every power plant built after 1980 has
to run on gas. Half the homes in America are heated
with gas. To further complicate matters, gas isn't
easy to import. Here in North America, it is
distributed through a vast pipeline network.
Gas imported from overseas would have to be
compressed at minus-260 degrees Fahrenheit in
pressurized tanker ships and unloaded (re-gasified)
at special terminals, of which few exist in America.
Moreover, the first attempts to site new terminals
have met furious opposition because they are such
ripe targets for terrorism.</P>

<P>"Some other things about the global energy predicament
are poorly understood by the public and even our
leaders.  <span class="bluetext">(((I wonder why he lists the ignoramuses
in this order.  As Jared Diamond points out,
civilizations collapse when the leaders are more
ignorant than the public.)))</span>  This is going to be
a permanent energy crisis, and these energy problems
will synergize with the disruptions of climate change,
epidemic disease and population overshoot to produce
higher orders of trouble.  <span class="bluetext">(((Yeah but &ndash; what if
there are PEAKS in the "epidemic disease" and
"population overshoot"?)))</span></P>

<P>"We will have to accommodate ourselves to
fundamentally changed conditions.  <span class="bluetext">(((Why not
fundamentally change our own conditions?
It's happening anyhow.)))</span></P>

<P>"No combination of alternative fuels will allow us
to run American life the way we have been used to
running it, or even a substantial fraction of it.
The wonders of steady technological progress achieved
through the reign of cheap oil have lulled us into
a kind of Jiminy Cricket syndrome, leading many
Americans to believe that anything we wish for
hard enough will come true. These days, even people
who ought to know better are wishing ardently for
a seamless transition from fossil fuels to their
putative replacements.<BR>
<span class="bluetext">(((I got similar problems with Jiminy Cricket, but
not because he's a Pollyanna. That insect is one of
those nagging, mindful, spiritual, conscience-driven
coffee-cup enviro types.  "Pinocchio, are you carved
from sustainable tropical woods?  Does your varnish
offgas carcinogens?"  Jeez, there's no  end to it.)))</span></P>

<P>"The widely touted 'hydrogen economy' is a particularly
cruel hoax. We are not going to replace the U.S.
automobile and truck fleet with vehicles run on
fuel cells. For one thing, the current generation of
fuel cells is largely designed to run on hydrogen
obtained from natural gas. The other way to get
hydrogen in the quantities wished for would be
electrolysis of water using power from hundreds
of nuclear plants. Apart from the dim prospect of
our building that many nuclear plants soon enough,
there are also numerous severe problems with
hydrogen's nature as an element that present
forbidding obstacles to its use as a replacement
for oil and gas, especially in storage and transport.
<span class="bluetext">(((Even if hydrogen storage and transport turn out
to have insuperable problems, that doesn't make
hydrogen a "hoax."  A hoax is a deliberate fraud.)))</span></P>

<P>"Wishful notions about rescuing our way of life with
'renewables' are also unrealistic. Solar-electric
systems and wind turbines face not only the enormous
problem of scale but the fact that the components
require substantial amounts of energy to manufacture
and the probability that they can't be manufactured
at all without the underlying support platform of a
fossil-fuel economy. We will surely use solar and
wind technology to generate some electricity for a
period ahead but probably at a very local and small
scale.  <span class="bluetext">(((Solar and wind have major problems, but
"smallness" isn't one of them.  The sun is very large.
The allegation that you can't build windmills
without oil is frankly weird.  Here, look:)))</span>
Link:<BR>
<br><a href="http://www.cityoffulton.us/windmill.php">http://www.cityoffulton.us/windmill.php</A></P>

<P>"Virtually all 'biomass' schemes for using plants to
create liquid fuels cannot be scaled up to even a
fraction of the level at which things are currently
run. What's more, these schemes are predicated on
using oil and gas 'inputs' (fertilizers, weed-killers)
to grow the biomass crops that would be converted
into ethanol or bio-diesel fuels. This is a net
energy loser &ndash; you might as well just burn the
inputs and not bother with the biomass products.
Proposals to distill trash and waste into oil by
means of thermal depolymerization depend on the huge
waste stream produced by a cheap oil and gas economy
in the first place.  <span class="bluetext">(((Wow, a Peak Oil trash crisis!
We might run out of trash!  Why isn't the Main
Stream Media covering this menace?)))</span></P>

<P>"Coal is far less versatile than oil and gas, extant
in less abundant supplies than many people assume
and fraught with huge ecological drawbacks &ndash; as a
contributor to greenhouse 'global warming' gases
and many health and toxicity issues ranging from
widespread mercury poisoning to acid rain. You can
make synthetic oil from coal, but the only time
this was tried on a large scale was by the Nazis
under wartime conditions, using impressive amounts
of slave labor.  <span class="bluetext">(((So, then, the Nazis had a Peak
Oil problem, right?  Did this make the Nazis collapse
without a shot being fired?)))</span></P>

<P>"If we wish to keep the lights on in America after
2020, we may indeed have to resort to nuclear power,
with all its practical problems and eco-conundrums.
Under optimal conditions, it could take ten years to
get a new generation of nuclear power plants into
operation, and the price may be beyond our means.
Uranium is also a resource in finite supply. We are
no closer to the more difficult project of atomic
fusion, by the way, than we were in the 1970s.
<span class="bluetext">(((I hate to hearken back to those Nazis again, but
the Manhattan Project didn't take ten years, and
nuclear power wasn't beyond the very modest means
of the 1940s.)))</span></P>

<P>"The upshot of all this is that we are entering a
historical period of potentially great instability,
turbulence and hardship.  <span class="bluetext">(((I think that started
when Bush was elected.)))</span>  Obviously, geopolitical
maneuvering around the world's richest energy regions
has already led to war and promises more international
military conflict. Since the Middle East contains
two-thirds of the world's remaining oil supplies,
the U.S. has attempted desperately to stabilize
the region by, in effect, opening a big police
station in Iraq. The intent was not just to secure
Iraq's oil but to modify and influence the behavior
of neighboring states around the Persian Gulf,
especially Iran and Saudi Arabia. The results have
been far from entirely positive, and our future
prospects in that part of the world are not something
we can feel altogether confident about.
<span class="bluetext">(((Suppose, for the sake of argument,  that we were
entering a historical period  of great stability,
inanity and self-indulgent consumer prosperity.
Would this be a real letdown?)))</span></P>

<P>"And then there is the issue of China, which, in 2004,
became the world's second-greatest consumer of oil,
surpassing Japan. China's surging industrial growth
has made it increasingly dependent on the imports we
are counting on. If China wanted to, it could easily
walk into some of these places &ndash; the Middle East,
former Soviet republics in central Asia &ndash; and extend
its hegemony by force. <span class="bluetext">(((As Tibet, Taiwan and
Xinjiang prove, it's really easy to be the Chinese
World Policeman.)))</span> Is America prepared to contest
for this oil in an Asian land war with the Chinese
army? I doubt it.<BR>
<span class="bluetext">(((I really hope the generals in the Chinese Army
don't imagine that they can "walk" armed troops
across national borders in a planet bristling with
pinpoint-accurate cruise missiles. The US military
is terrible at occupation, but when it comes
to ripping conventional armies apart, it's got no
peer competitors.)))</span></P>

<P>"Nor can the U.S. military occupy regions of the
Eastern Hemisphere indefinitely, or hope to secure
either the terrain or the oil infrastructure of one
distant, unfriendly country after another. A likely
scenario is that the U.S. could exhaust and bankrupt
itself trying to do this, and be forced to withdraw
back into our own hemisphere, having lost access to
most of the world's remaining oil in the process."
<span class="bluetext">(((Wouldn't that leave a surfeit of oil for everybody
else, peak or no peak?  I don't see why Peak Oil guys
are so eager to demonize the Chinese.  Wouldn't the
'Yellow Peril'  be about ten times scarier if they
were self-sufficient in energy?)))</span></P>


<P>"We know that our national leaders are hardly
uninformed about this predicament. President George
W. Bush has been briefed on the dangers of the oil-peak
situation as long ago as before the 2000 election
and repeatedly since then. In March, the Department
of Energy released a report that officially
acknowledges for the first time that peak oil is
for real and states plainly that 'the world has
never faced a problem like this. Without massive
mitigation more than a decade before the fact, the
problem will be pervasive and will not be temporary.'
<span class="bluetext">(((Wow!  The foresightful Cheney and the Bush
Department of Energy! Right on top  of the job, eh?
Mmmm-hmmm!)))</span></P>

<P>"Most of all, the Long Emergency will require us to
make other arrangements for the way we live in the
United States. America is in a special predicament
due to a set of unfortunate choices we made as a
society in the twentieth century. Perhaps the worst
was to let our towns and cities rot away and to
replace them with suburbia, which had the additional
side effect of trashing a lot of the best farmland
in America. Suburbia will come to be regarded as the
greatest misallocation of resources in the history
of the world. It has a tragic destiny. The psychology
of previous investment suggests that we will defend
our drive-in utopia long after it has become a
terrible liability.  <span class="bluetext">(((In other words, we're even
dumber, more stubborn, and poorer investors than
Communists.)))</span></P>

<P>"Before long, the suburbs will fail us in practical
terms. We made the ongoing development of housing
subdivisions, highway strips, fried-food shacks
and shopping malls the basis of our economy,
<span class="bluetext">(((luckily, there's no such thing as an inner-city
fried-food shack)))</span> and when we have to stop making
more of those things, the bottom will fall out.</P>

<P>"The circumstances of the Long Emergency will
require us to downscale and re-scale virtually
everything we do and how we do it, from the kind
of communities we physically inhabit to the way we
grow our food to the way we work and trade the
products of our work. Our lives will become
profoundly and intensely local. Daily life will
be far less about mobility and much more about
staying where you are.  <span class="bluetext">(((There were no mass
migrations during the oil-deprived Dark Ages, unless
you count Huns, Mongols, Vandals, Celts, Langobards,
Avars, Angles, Saxons, Vikings, anyone who believed
in Mohammed, and practically everybody else.)))</span></P>

<P>"Anything organized on the large scale, whether it
is government or a corporate business enterprise
such as Wal-Mart, will wither as the cheap energy props
that support bigness fall away. <span class="bluetext">(((Does that include
the Catholic Church?)))</span> The turbulence of the Long
Emergency will produce a lot of economic losers,
and many of these will be members of an angry and
aggrieved former middle class.   <span class="bluetext">(((It seems to me
that, given this line of argument, the biggest
losers in all this ought to be the globalizing,
jet-setting  upper class.  How will they get to
Davos?)))</span></P>

<P>"Food production is going to be an enormous problem
in the Long Emergency. As industrial agriculture
fails due to a scarcity of oil- and gas-based inputs,
we will certainly have to grow more of our food
closer to where we live, and do it on a smaller scale.
The American economy of the mid-twenty-first century
may actually center on agriculture, not information,
not high tech, not 'services' like real estate sales
or hawking cheeseburgers to tourists. Farming. This
is no doubt a startling, radical idea, and it raises
extremely difficult questions about the reallocation
of land and the nature of work. <span class="bluetext">(((Yeah &ndash; it's such
a 'startling, radical idea' that I frankly don't buy
it.  There's no way that small-scale localized farming
can ever support the planet's population.)))</span></P>

<P>"The relentless subdividing of land in the late
twentieth century has destroyed the contiguity and
integrity of the rural landscape in most places.
<span class="bluetext">(((Oh, and the poles are melting and Spain is on
fire, but those aren't the kind of "landscape" that
upsets our author's sense of proper contiguity.)))</span>
The process of readjustment is apt to be disorderly
and improvisational. Food production will necessarily
be much more labor-intensive than it has been for
decades. We can anticipate the re-formation of a
native-born American farm-laboring class. It will
be composed largely of the aforementioned economic
losers who had to relinquish their grip on the
American dream. These masses of disentitled people
may enter into quasi-feudal social relations with
those who own land in exchange for food and physical
security. But their sense of grievance will remain
fresh, and if mistreated they may simply seize that
land.</P>

<P>"The way that commerce is currently organized in
America will not survive far into the Long Emergency.
Wal-Mart's 'warehouse on wheels' won't be such a
bargain in a non-cheap-oil economy. The national
chain stores' 12,000-mile manufacturing supply
lines could easily be interrupted by military contests
over oil and by internal conflict in the nations that
have been supplying us with ultra-cheap manufactured
goods, because they, too, will be struggling with
similar issues of energy famine and all the disorders
that go with it.  <span class="bluetext">(((World War II was a 'military
contest over oil' and the disorders led to centralized
rationing, not a wild feudal famine.)))</span></P>

<P>"As these things occur, America will have to make other
arrangements for the manufacture, distribution and
sale of ordinary goods. They will probably be made on
a 'cottage industry' basis rather than the factory
system we once had, since the scale of available
energy will be much lower &ndash; and we are not going to
replay the twentieth century. Tens of thousands of
the common products we enjoy today, from paints to
pharmaceuticals, are made out of oil. They will
become increasingly scarce or unavailable. The selling
of things will have to be reorganized at the local
scale. It will have to be based on moving merchandise
shorter distances. It is almost certain to result
in higher costs for the things we buy and far fewer
choices.  <span class="bluetext">(((Where did all the global satellites and
computer networks go?)))</span></P>

<P>"The automobile will be a diminished presence in our
lives, to say the least. With gasoline in short supply,
not to mention tax revenue, our roads will surely
suffer. The interstate highway system is more delicate
than the public realizes. If the 'level of service'
(as traffic engineers call it) is not maintained to
the highest degree, problems multiply and escalate
quickly. The system does not tolerate partial failure.
The interstates are either in excellent condition,
or they quickly fall apart.  <span class="bluetext">(((Why would they fall
apart when nobody's wearing them out?)))</span></P>

<P>"America today has a railroad system that the
Bulgarians would be ashamed of. Neither of the
two major presidential candidates in 2004 mentioned
railroads, but if we don't refurbish our rail system,
then there may be no long-range travel or transport
of goods at all a few decades from now. The commercial
aviation industry, already on its knees financially,
is likely to vanish. The sheer cost of maintaining
gigantic airports may not justify the operation of a
much-reduced air-travel fleet. Railroads are far more
energy efficient than cars, trucks or airplanes, and
they can be run on anything from wood to electricity.
The rail-bed infrastructure is also far more economical
to maintain than our highway network.  <span class="bluetext">(((Even the
rail infrastructure of the 19th century was enough
to maintain flourishing, nation-wide mail-order
consumer catalogs.)))</span></P>

<P>"The successful regions in the twenty-first century
will be the ones surrounded by viable farming
hinterlands that can reconstitute locally sustainable
economies on an armature of civic cohesion. Small
towns and smaller cities have better prospects than
the big cities, which will probably have to contract
substantially. The process will be painful and
tumultuous. In many American cities, such as Cleveland,
Detroit and St. Louis, that process is already well
advanced. Others have further to fall. New York and
Chicago face extraordinary difficulties, being
oversupplied with gigantic buildings out of scale
with the reality of declining energy supplies.   <span class="bluetext">(((Chicago and New York are major rail 
centers.
Wouldn't they bloom instantly?)))</span></P>

<P>"Their former agricultural hinterlands have long been
paved over. They will be encysted in a surrounding
fabric of necrotic suburbia  <span class="bluetext">((( I want the T-shirt)))</span>
that will only amplify and reinforce the cities'
problems. Still, our cities occupy important sites.
Some kind of urban entities will exist where they are
in the future, but probably not the colossi of
twentieth-century industrialism.  <span class="bluetext">(((Most urban colossi
are in pre-industrial Third World countries.)))</span></P>

<P>"Some regions of the country will do better than
others in the Long Emergency. The Southwest will
suffer in proportion to the degree that it prospered
during the cheap-oil blowout of the late twentieth
century. I predict that Sunbelt states like Arizona
and Nevada will become significantly depopulated,
since the region will be short of water as well as
gasoline and natural gas. Imagine Phoenix without
cheap air conditioning.  <span class="bluetext">(((It's called Baghdad.)))</span></P>

<P>"I'm not optimistic about the Southeast, either, for
different reasons. I think it will be subject to
substantial levels of violence as the grievances of
the formerly middle class boil over and collide with
the delusions of Pentecostal Christian extremism.
The latent encoded behavior of Southern culture
includes an outsized notion of individualism and
the belief that firearms ought to be used in the
defense of it. This is a poor recipe for civic
cohesion.  <span class="bluetext">(((Smile when you say that, Yankee!)))</span></P>

<P>"The Mountain States and Great Plains will face an
array of problems, from poor farming potential to
water shortages to population loss. The Pacific
Northwest, New England and the Upper Midwest have
somewhat better prospects. I regard them as less
likely to fall into lawlessness, anarchy or despotism
and more likely to salvage the bits and pieces of
our best social traditions and keep them in operation
at some level.</P>

<P>"These are daunting and even dreadful prospects.
<span class="bluetext">(((He remarked, licking his chops.)))</span> The Long
Emergency is going to be a tremendous trauma for
the human race. We will not believe that this is
happening to us, that 200 years of modernity can be
brought to its knees by a world-wide power shortage.
<span class="bluetext">(((I'm ahead of the curve, because I don't believe
it already.)))</span> The survivors will have to cultivate
a religion of hope &ndash; that is, a deep and comprehensive
belief that humanity is worth carrying on. <span class="bluetext">(((We need
a NEW RELIGION to solve all this?  Gimme a break!)))</span>)</P>

<P>"If there is any positive side to stark changes
coming our way, it may be in the benefits of close
communal relations, of having to really work
intimately (and physically) with our neighbors,
to be part of an enterprise that really matters
and to be fully engaged in meaningful social
enactments instead of being merely entertained
to avoid boredom. Years from now, when we hear
singing at all, we will hear ourselves, and we
will sing with our whole hearts.  <span class="bluetext">(((Why not sing
now?)))</span></P>

<h2>
"I Cannot Yet Skin A Deer</h2>

<P>"Are you prepared for the Big Collapse? Peak Oil?
Rural life? Can you pickle meat and eat bark?</P>

<P>By Mark Morford, SF Gate Columnist
Friday, July 15, 2005</P>

<p>
"Rare is the opportunity to use authentic, down 'n'
dirty rural survival skills in the city. It's true.</P>

<P>"You don't need to know, for example, how to skin a
deer or pickle your own asparagus or nurture an
understanding of which kind of deadwood is best for
cookin' pig snouts over the fire pit, or how to
shingle your roof with rocks and clay, or how to dig
really large holes in the backyard for long-term
storage of winter wheat and dead chickens and hoary
annoying relatives.  <span class="bluetext">(((After this, it gets even
better.)))</span></P>

<P>"City-bred skills and intuitions are, to be sure,
unique. But there will apparently be very little
call, after the Bush-branded apocalypse rains down,
for knowledge of which seat in the cafe gets the best
Wi-Fi signal or where to find the finest burrito
after midnight in the Mission when you are post-
coitally blissed and in need of refueling.</P>

<P>"Very little call, after the Big Ungodly Crash,
for knowledge of where to get the most amazing cheap
dim sum, how much the large bottle of Astroglide
costs at the local Good Vibrations, or which tiny
parking spaces in my girlfriend's neighborhood I
can sneak into for emergency booty calls without
her uptight neighbors calling Bob's Towing.</P>

<P>"This all comes to mind as I realize, with increasing
sense of dread and alarm and a weird sense of
fatalistic ennui, that if any of the dire
prognostications for the world soon comes to pass,
if the oil crisis strikes as violently as predicted
and/or if the eviscerated U.S. economy spirals us
into a new and violent Great Depression 2.0 and/or
if BushCo does indeed succeed in bringing the wrath
of an angry spiteful homophobic God down upon the
swarming gay-lovin' tofu-sucking heathen masses,
I might not be as well prepared as I'd like.</P>

<P>"I am not at all ready for the big return to the
agrarian life, as predicted by the most dire Peak
Oil prognosticators. I am not at all ready to have
the devastated cities plowed under, so that we may
plant crops in the ravaged landscape in a desperate
attempt to survive the onslaught of a world without
home pizza delivery and without drive-thru dry
cleaning and without instant and immediate access
to supermarkets with their 47 kinds of pasta and 138
different brands of vodka, not to mention the meaty
edible flesh of nearly any animal I wish to custom
order from the Williams-Sonoma catalog and have
FedExed to me within 24 hours in pretty decorated
tins. Mmm, prosciutto.</P>

<P>"I have no immediate escape route. I do not have
land nearby, in the woods, protected by razor wire
and laser fencing and large angry dogs. I do not
have some place that has enormous underground tanks
of propane and oil and grains and canned tomatoes
and frozen elk meat and mountains of small-gauge
ammunition and stores of camouflage underwear.
<span class="bluetext">(((You and me both, brother.)))</span></P>

<P>"I do not know how to dig a water well. I do not know
how to install a septic pump. I know not the best
month in which to plant potatoes and corn and peas
and opium poppies. I cannot knit blankets or sweaters,
much less some nice handmade cozies to protect my
Pyrex-glass dildo collection.</P>

<P>"I currently own no power tools, save for a single
small Black &amp; Decker rechargeable drill which I use,
of course, not for building a family shelter out of
rusty car hoods and not for remodeling my nonexistent
garage so it can support a family of 10 and not for
cobbling together a chicken coop from scrap wood and
baling wire and mesh, but rather, for hanging
bitchin' shelving cubes from West Elm.</P>

<P>"Oh, make no mistake, the city offers its own dangers
and there are plenty of urban survival skills
mandatory for navigating the urban jungle, such
as learning how to deftly avoid eye contact with
ranting homeless people and how to appear tough
and muscular when you walk by those small gangs of
slouchy angry hooded dudes who look at you like
you're the fish and they're the dynamite.</P>

<P>"I know how to calmly pray for a parking space a mile
before arrival and which sushi joint has the freshest
uni and which coffee shop makes the finest soy mocha.
I know when Macy's designer stuff goes on double-
markdown and who you have to know to get wholesale
designer furniture and which yoga teacher has the
best kirtan, and how to get a large leather chair
up two flights of narrow Victorian stairs and the
best place to have sex in Golden Gate Park.</P>

<P>"But alas, this is not nearly enough.</P>

<P>"I will, when the devolution comes and oil is $200
a barrel and we are at war with China and the dollar
is worth about three cents on the euro, be relying on
the talents and largesse of others. I have, for
example, a wonderful brother-in-law with his own
ranch-compound up near Spokane, well stocked with
guns and canned goods and copious hiding spaces,
and it is remote and rural and ready to be turned
into a guarded inbreeding complex just after BushCo
finally mistakes his electric toothbrush for the
'nukular' button and hastens the end of the world
as we know it, just as the evangelicals are right
now pleading.</P>

<P>"I have a girlfriend whose sister is a well-trained
organic farmer, able to grow an entire meal for 25 in
a shoebox, well versed in mulch and compost toilets
and soil types and what sort of mushrooms you can
and cannot eat when you're out scavenging for scraps
among the torched babies and the smoking carcasses
and the giant robotic cockroaches.  <span class="bluetext">(((The 'giant
robotic cockroaches' are a fab Worldchanging touch
here.  Hey man, with 'giant robotic cockroaches,'
another world is not just possible, it's creepin'
right under the door jamb.)))</span></P>

<P>"But I am merely a hanger-on. I am not trained.
This much must be admitted: When it comes to Armageddon
prep, the red states have us city folk beat.
Sure-sure, cities are the cultural and social and
economic engines of the nation; sure we have all
the Ph.D.s and all the artistic talents and all
the book-learnin' and progressive ideas and cool
European cars and the good wine and the better
sex and the polysyllabic words.</P>

<P>"But when the economy collapses and the End is Nigh,
well, most of us shall fall by the roadside, begging
for scraps from the angry evangelical Idaho potato
farmer in the beat-up pickup with the little flags
stuck on the bumper, and he shall chortle and spit
tobacco through his nine teeth and turn up the James
Dobson Christian Family Hour on the AM and drive off
toward the mushroom cloud, whistling.  <span class="bluetext">(((Probably
not, considering that American non-farmers have
farmers outnumbered about 97 to 3.)))</span></P>

<P>"The red states will finally rule the world. They
will survive. They know how. They can eat squirrel
brains. They can pickle things, including various
animal parts. They have been known to marry each
other. They can subsist on bad beer and cow pies
and stuff they find growing in the rusty tailpipes
of old farm equipment. They know how to perform home
surgery using only a rusty butter knife and bathroom
caulk. They eat mice.</P>

<P>"But then again, should this all come to pass and
the oil crisis strikes and the economy nose-dives
and the cities crumble and our iPod batteries fail
and international commerce implodes and we're all
rushing back to the farmland to hump hay and steal
each others' wives and ogle sheep and rediscover a
life that is, all over again, nasty, brutish, and
short, well, maybe I will no longer care.</P>


<P>"Maybe then it will finally be time to throw in
the karmic towel, drink the special Kool-Aid, and
let the meek inherit the Earth while the rest of us
go to the stars. After all, while I'd actually
love to learn to work an organic farm or build a
cabin from scratch or learn to distinguish species
of trees by examining their leaves and then having
sex under their branches, it's just not much fun
anymore when we're all out of music and wine and
coffee and the entire nation becomes, well, Oklahoma.
I mean, what kind of joy is that? And where will I
park my Audi?</P>
