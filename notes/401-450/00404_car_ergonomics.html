<P>"Say so long to cockpit ergonomics." 
BY JOHN PHILLIPS 
April 2004</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"There's a Joseph Conrad-derived scene in Apocalypse Now when Captain Willard says, 
  'They told me that you had gone totally insane, and that your methods were, uh, unsound.'  
  <b>(((Hey wait a minute == is this a <STRONG>car review</STRONG> in CAR AND DRIVER?  This 
  guy's good!)))</b></P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>"Colonel Kurtz asks, 'Are my methods unsound?'</P>

<P>"And Willard replies, 'Uh, I don't see any method at
all, sir.'</P>

<P>"Exactly. I see no method in modern cockpit ergonomics.
Remember ergonomics? It's become a lost science, as 
denigrated as astrology and apparently less useful. In
part, I blame in-dash navigation systems and so-called
automatic climate controls, which together have done
to ergonomics what Arthur Andersen did to corporate 
accounting.  <b>(((Woah.)))</b></P>

<P>"Why do so many nav systems take precedence in the 
center stack, ousting vital secondary controls to 
regions more readily controlled by passengers? I use
the radio and HVAC controls daily, hourly, minute by
minute, yet rely on the GPS to guide me less than twice
per month. (That's a lie. I've never used a GPS.) At
what point did buyers come to equate vehicular value
with electronic complexity?  <b>(((At this point, I'm 
settling right in and munching taco chips.)))</b></P>

<P>"I recently drove a Nissan Quest for 13 days and 1000
miles. Many of its secondary controls are located on a
big pie plate that juts up from where the center stack
should be. A swell idea, sure, except there's no room
for the CD player on this pie plate, so it's been 
relegated to a shelf below. It's invisible to the 
driver. To insert a disc, you just stab and poke the CD
randomly into shadows down around your knees. 
<b>(((He's got a gift!  No doubt about it.)))</b></P>

<P>"Or you  can pull over, put the vehicle in park, 
unfasten your belt, stick your head between the front
seats, and grope for a spell. Even when you do find the
slot, your CD won't be accepted until you locate the
'load' button, which apparently makes a kind of dinner
reservation for music.</P>

<P><b>(((Maybe one should forget about those dangerous 
CDs and go back to chatting on the cellphone 
as one drives.)))</b></P>

<P>"Prominent on the Quest's pie plate are three large 
rotary knobs that operate the HVAC system. Below them
are radio and GPS controls. Touch any of these and you
may actually cause something to happen, but you won't
know what until you raise your head and consult a big
LCD screen located behind the pie plate and atop the
dash. It's in a different focal plane.</P>

<P>"To tune the radio you must first take your eyes off
the road, readjust your vision to activate one of 14
different radio buttons, readjust your vision to study
the LCD screen above and behind, then readjust your 
vision a third time to focus on the FedEx truck you're
about to T-bone.</P>

<P><b>(((Move over, Jakob Nielsen, Donald Norman!)))</b> 
 
"What's more, if you're driving at dawn or at dusk or 
with your lights on during dreary days == as happened 
to me during all four days of the Thanksgiving 
weekend == the icons and digits appearing on the LCD 
are too dim to read. To determine whether the defroster 
was on, I once had to pull over, turn the headlights</P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<P>off, then cup my hand over a bevy of LCD glyphs, of 
which there are 22. <b>(((!)))</b> It's like having to turn
on the TV  in your den to find out whether your oven
is cooking at 350 degrees.</P>

<P>"To alter the Quest's driver's-side cockpit temp, you
twist the left-most rotary knob nearly three inches to
port (to subtract a degree) or three inches to 
starboard (to add). The temp you've summoned flashes in
little digits on the LCD screen, not even in the same
area code as the rotary control.</P>

<P><b>((("Area code" problem, huh? Good thing I've got 
roaming on that cellphone!)))</b></P>

<P>"This control, by the way, is spring-loaded to let you
know it resents being twisted. <b>(((This brilliant 
rhetorical move  is what John Ruskin used to call 
"the pathetic fallacy," and lo, it is the very living
soul of Victorian poesy.)))</b> It takes one second for 
each new digit to flash up on the LCD. To adjust the
fan speed,  you must focus on the center of the rotary
knob, which is split in half, creating two 
hemispherical rocker switches. Now it gets really 
complicated: Push the topmost lip of the top rocker 
to increase fan speed.</P>

<P><b>(((I know that it's getting "really complicated," but
by now I trust the narrator completely.)))</b></P>

<P>"Push the lowermost lip of the lower rocker to decrease
fan speed. Misdirect a finger by a fraction and nothing</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>at all happens. Poke the upper half of the center 
rotary control to change where air blows == in your 
eyes, up your pants. <b>(((Just relax == we're in the 
hands of a master here.)))</b> But everything here responds 
so lethargically == and requires such pinpoint finger 
accuracy in one plane and detailed observation of a 
largely illegible LCD in another == that it's like 
operating a toaster with your toes.</P>

<P>knobs  <b>(((that's the rapierlike coup de grace)))</b> are 
two more panels of pushbuttons == 28 in all, more than 
exist letters in our alphabet.   <b>(((I stand in awe.)))</b> 
One set is ostensibly for the GPS, one for the radio. 
Except mixed in with the nav controls are the radio's 
seek and tune buttons, making for a kind of year-long</P>
