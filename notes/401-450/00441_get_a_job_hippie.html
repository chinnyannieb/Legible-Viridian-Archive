<h2>Viridian Note 00441: Get a Job, Hippie</h2>

<P><strong>Key concepts:</strong> employment opportunity, Worldchanging,
Seattle, herding supersmart global anarchist cats,
fundraising trips to Monte Carlo</P>


<P><strong>Attention Conservation Notice:</strong>  You may already
have a job.  This one may be better than
the one you have, though.  It's in Seattle.</P>

<P>"Producer, <a href="http://worldchanging.com">WorldChanging.Com</a></P>

<P>"WorldChanging.com is an award-winning and
fast-growing weblog/magazine covering tools,
models and ideas for building a better future.
We're hiring a producer:</P>

<P>"Changing the world requires getting and staying
organized. You're here to make that happen.</P>


<P>"Imagine you. You're both worldchanging and wonderful
to work with. You are professional, friendly,
optimistic, organized, energetic and impassioned.
Like a superhero, you can kick ass and tell jokes
at the same time. You secretly think that when
Margaret Mead said 'Never doubt that a small group
of thoughtful, committed people can change the world,'
she was talking about you.</P>

<P>"Now, imagine herding cats. Brilliant, disorganized,
ADD cats, with big ideas and a tendency to fly off
to other countries at a moment's notice. Imagine,
in fact, that those cats were already spread across
the planet. If herding a growing gang of super-smart,
passionate, global cats into a finely-tuned
anarchist marching band sounds like fun to you,
boy do we have your dream job.</P>

<P>"If you're that lucky cat-herder, you'll get to:</P>

<P>"1) Act as the central hub of a globally-networked
organization, the still point around which our
vast media empire turns!</P>

<P>"Be an excellent 'air traffic controller,' knowing
exactly what's going on with all projects at all
times, making sure schedules are kept, books are
tight and communications flow smoothly.</P>

<P>"Facilitate the work of the board of directors:
scheduling meetings, attending to minutes and
follow-up actions, making sure all board members
have prompt and full knowledge of all needed
information.</P>

<P>"2) Be the number two person, minimizing the
Executive Editor's distraction and maximizing
his productivity by being the first line of
defense in the war on chaos!</P>

<P>"Act as first assistant to EE.</P>

<P>"Serve as primary interface between EE and
readers, general public and media. Help facilitate
EE's schedule and workflow.</P>

<P>"Serve as needed as primary liaison between EE,
staff, writers and other project participants</P>

<P>"Supervise special projects as required, and
facilitate project management of on-going editorial
and programmatic activities.</P>

<P>"3) Let the power go to your head while you
set-up and run Worldchanging's office and
day-to-day business affairs, including having
primary day-to-day managerial and financial
oversight responsibilities &ndash; when you snap your
fingers, our contract bean-counters and
paper-shufflers dance!</P>

<P>"Create an office.</P>

<P>"Supervise administrative staff and interns,
and participate in their hiring.</P>

<P>"Create (and improve) office systems, bookkeeping
and legal reporting systems, organizational
calendar, payroll and benefits tracking,
and so on.</P>

<P>"Establish and manage relationships with vendors
(e.g., webhost) and professional service providers
(e.g., bookkeeper).</P>

<P>"4) Help bring in the bling by acting initially as
a primary liaison on development work (helping
track grant deadlines, setting meetings, etc.)
and then as a member of the development team
planning and executing our overall development
strategy, including our 'fundraising trip'
to Monte-Carlo ('Come on lucky dice, baby needs
an operational support grant!').</P>

<P>"5) Change the world and be home in time for supper.</P>

<P><BR>
"What kind of qualifications might impress us?</P>

<ul><li>BA and 3+ years of organizational or project
management experience;<BR>
<li>Incredible &ndash; perhaps slightly disturbing &ndash;
love of systems, organization and detail;
<li>Hands-on knowledge of office management,
including all those practical office and computer
skills as well as basic budgeting and bookkeeping;
<li>At least passing acquaintanceship with nonprofit
organizations;<BR>
<li>Excellent people skills and sense of humor;
<li>Ability to manage junior staff;
<li>Comfort working with international and diverse
colleagues;<BR>
<li>Outstanding references.
<li>Knowledge of WorldChanging content and issues
desirable but not a deal-breaker: passion for
changing the world non-negotiable.</ul>

<P>"Salary: Highly competitive nonprofit salary.
Excellent benefits. Great work environment.
"Location: This is a full-time job based in
Seattle, WA.<BR>
"Start date: Yesterday.</P>

<P>"Worldchanging strongly values diversity, and
actively encourages women, people of color and
cultural minorities to apply.</P>

<P>"To apply, email your resume and a letter
(telling us why you're perfect for the job)
