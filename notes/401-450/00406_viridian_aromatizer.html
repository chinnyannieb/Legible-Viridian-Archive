Useful electrical power from the almighty stench of 
bacterial sewage.</P>

<P>It's time for a new Viridian Design contest, brought to 
us by Paul Groepler, serial entrepreneur and Chief 
Technical Officer of "Headspace Technologies, Inc.," 
in Austin, Texas.</P>

<P>Mr. Groepler is currently developing a computer
and cellphone peripheral that <STRONG>emits smells.</STRONG> 
The device can be connected to a PC via USB or via wireless protocol, for instance 
Bluetooth.</P>

<P>The precise specs of his patented technology
are of no relevance to us Viridians.  Suffice to say 
that this aroma-spreading gizmo can range from the 
scale and weight of, say, a stack of two aspirins. 
up  to about the size of a CD player.  It can therefore be plugged into computers, laptops,
 cellphones, PDAs, car cigarette lighters, etc etc.</P>

<P>Its purpose is  spritz gaseous substances.  Not just
aromas, scents and perfumes, but also visible smoke, 
pepper spray, ozone, fine particles of soot; just about any gaseous material.  The amount 
dispersed can range from a few micrograms to a few grams, over time.</P>

<P>The device can emit its aromas on command: quickly,
slowly, intermittently, or steadily.</P>


<P>Mr. Groepler is looking for inventive applications
and niche products for his infant technology.  "Smell- 
o-vision" has already been suggested. Smell-o-vision 
is a dead medium, however, and the addition of smell 
to computer games seems corny and too limited.   He's 
searching for something a bit more, well, Viridian.</P>

<P>Given our long-term interest in an atmosphere tainted
with emissions, this project is a natural for us.</P>

<P><strong>THE RULES:</strong> <br><br> 
Write up your suggested application for the Aromatizer. Try to make it brief and clear. 
(If you can't be clear, at least be funny.)  Send 
your text to the Viridian Pope-Emperor at 
<br><a href="mailto:bruces@well.com">bruces@well.com</A>.  I will collate these entries 
and mail them out to the list.</P>

<P>This contest is similar in spirit to the "Viridian Neologue Contest." It's 
not about giving shape and
form to the Aromatizer.  It's about concepts for 
use and exploitation.

<br><a href="http://www.viridianrepository.com/neologue/neologue.htm">http://www.viridianrepository.com/neologue/neologue.htm</A></P>

<P>The contest ends May 11, 2004.</P>

<P>The contest judge will be Paul Groepler.  His
decisions are final. Furthermore, he may well put one 
or more of these notions into production.</P>

<P>OFFICIAL BIO OF CONTEST JUDGE</P>

<P>"Paul F. Groepler brings over twenty-two years
of professional experience in business and technology,

successful technology ventures such as Sun Microsystems 
Gmbh, Technology Works, CableHealthCare, Leapfrog 
Wireless and Aeon Technology B.V..</P>

<P>"In addition to his technology background,
Mr. Groepler was a private equity, high technology 
fund manager for LB Swiss (Zurich) for 8 successful 
years. Mr. Groepler performed research and design 
consulting work for varied organizations ranging from 
the United Nations to the Max Planck Institute, and 
has applied for 12 patents.  He was selected for 
special study by the National Science Foundation,

<P>And now the prize.  The Prize for this Viridian Contest is the very apt and 
attractive:</P>

<P>HOMELAND ESCAPE HOOD by Approved Gas Masks, Dotcom, Inc!</P>

<P>Link: 
<br><a href="http://www.approvedgasmasks.com/hood-homeland.htm">http://www.approvedgasmasks.com/hood-homeland.htm</A></P>


<P>Imagine yourself escaping the tainted air of
your own Homeland in this lightweight, WMD-resistant 
Tyvek hood and respirator!</P>

<P>"The Homeland consists of an  outer hood with integral 
NIOSH-approved half-mask and NP1000  filters. The 
NP1000 Filter is NIOSH-tested against radionuclides. 
In addition, the manufacturer has independently-tested 
the  NP1000 filter against a wide range of chemicals, 
including  simulated nerve agents. The  hood features 
an extra wide, clear visor and an integral  antifogging 
mask which provides the wearer with an excellent view.</P>

<P>"Sealed and packaged for long term storage in a 
metalized  reusable pouch, the Homeland Hood is 
an ideal emergency escape  mask &amp; is suitable for 'evacuation use.</P>

<P>"Tychem  material  is inexpensive, lightweight &amp; 
provides an excellent barrier  against chemical 
hazards, widely used for domestic preparedness &amp; 
chemical  protection.  One size fits nearly  all 
adults. These combination NBC canisters  provide 
protection against toxic agents, chem-bio  hazards, 
gases, vapors &amp; aerosols. Independently evaluated &amp; 
proven  effective against certain levels of war gases, 
terrorist  agents such as nerve gas, blood agents, 
irritants, choking agents &amp; tear gas. Satisfies CDC 
recommendations for  respiratory protection against 
particulate bio-hazards. P100  HEPA efficiency, 
99.97% effective against aerosols, fumes,  mists, 
radon daughters, radionuclides &amp; dusts. NIOSH  approved 
for use against organic vapors, chlorine, hydrogen 
chloride, sulfur dioxide, formaldehyde, ammonia, 
methylamine,  high efficiency (hepa) against 
particulates. Standard NATO  40mm thread. 15 year 
shelf life, sealed for long term storage."</P>

<P>If you win this contest, this handsome conversation
piece and its possibly lifesaving canisters will be 
shipped to you no matter where you live!</P>
