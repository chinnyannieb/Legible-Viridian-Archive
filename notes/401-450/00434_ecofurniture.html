They're setting weather records back in Los Angeles.
Good thing I happen to be in Raleigh, North Carolina
at the moment.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, in Austin, plug-in hybrids appear on 
the city agenda.

<P>Buy a hybrid, they're great. Even normal people 
think so.

<P>We just had "weather" affect the Earth's atmosphere
from halfway across the galaxy.

in a full-scale punch-out dust-up with Greenpeace.

<P><span class="bluetext">(((David Bergman's eco-furniture list has always 
been popular with random web browsers and is the probably the closest thing that 
viridiandesign.org
has to a "service." To the joy of uncounted 
dozens, he recently updated it. Go have a look. 
Here's why:)))</span></P>

<P>"Eco-furniture: A broad and very subjective list</P>

<P>Compiled by David Bergman</P>

<P>"All of the additions in this newest version of the
Viridian Furniture list are in one category, the one
that I titled in an obvious moment of kowtow to our
Viridian Pope: 'What if Green Design Were Just Good Design.' But that's a good thing (the 
additions, not
the brown nosing). It means that eco designed 
furniture is becoming less like what too many 
people think all eco furniture looks like. It's 
breaking out of its crunchy niche and getting its
sustainable teeth into everything. Mainstreamed 
green design, though, is not necessarily Viridian
design. We still need more of the type of stuff 
Bruce saw at the 2001 International Contemporary 
Furniture Fair, but conceived so that it doesn't 
compromise basic eco concepts like using sustainable
materials. Unfortunately, much of the cool stuff &ndash;
the things we unrepentant materialists crave &ndash; isn't
really all that green. An incredibly fantastic 
blobject made of polyurethane is still petroleum-based.</P>

<P>For the most part, I've not listed things that 
can't be seen online. For instance, there's a lot
of great stuff to be found via the IDRA website, 
but often nothing further to be found about the 
designer or manufacturer. Same thing with an 
interesting new book, Eco-design: the Sourcebook 
&ndash;further info on most of the items isn't available
online.</P>

<P>"The disclaimer: With a few exceptions, I haven't
checked the designers' or manufacturers' claims. 
I'm hoping there's not too much greenwashing going
on here.’&Auml;&para;</P>

<P>"Please send your suggestions and additions to David Bergman."</P>
