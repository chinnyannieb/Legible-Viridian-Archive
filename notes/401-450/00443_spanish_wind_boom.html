<P>"Windfall: How turbines have stirred up rural Spain</P>

<P>"For years La Muela was only known for a stiff wind
that brought cold winters. Now, alternative energy
has generated an extraordinary economic boom.
Elizabeth Nash reports</P>

<P>"As you approach the village of La Muela, the white,
energy-producing windmills with their spinning
blades appear in splendid geometric formation.
They rise up to dominate the horizon, ranging
across the jagged ridges and barren windswept plains
like a forest of slender mechanical trees: the
symbols of an extraordinary wind-assisted 
renaissance in this impoverished corner of rural
Spain.</P>

<P>"Over the past decade, 500 wind machines have
sprouted around the little hamlet, which lies
15 miles (25km) from Zaragoza. Once a forgotten
village in one of Spain's poorest regions, La Muela
has become a capital of wind-assisted energy
production. And the windmills have not only
transformed the landscape. From the moment the
first blades began to whir, the good times for
La Muela's 3,000 inhabitants began to roll.
<span class="bluetext">((("Wind sheiks."  "The curse of wind.")))</span></P>

<P>"Each year, the giant electricity companies that
run the windmills pay about L1m (E600,000) to
La Muela's local council in royalties and land
rents, and another E500,000 to private landowners,
who receive E2,000 or E3,000 annually per windmill,
according to their power. Most turbines generate
between 600 and 800kw per hour but some as tall
as 24-storey skyscrapers produce 2,000kw/h.</P>

<P>"After knowing only hardship for generations,
La Muela's residents have stumbled on a windfall
that has changed their lives. The fierce north wind
that gives La Muela its Siberian winters has also
made its fortune.</P>

<P>"The council has ploughed its money into, among
other ventures, a booming industrial park outside
the village that produces goods including rustic
furniture, Ferrari automobile parts and field
tents for the Spanish army. The surrounding area
enjoys the use of three heated indoor swimming pools &ndash;
one Olympic-sized &ndash; three jacuzzis, three outdoor
pools and a cafeteria. The second phase of the
sports complex &ndash; being built &ndash; includes a
football pitch, tennis, squash and pelota courts,
and running tracks.  <span class="bluetext">(((I wonder why they bother with
the "industrial park."  Wouldn't they be better off
talking to the world's other windy regions about
the wind equivalent of OPEC?)))</span></P>

<P>"Opposite is a new concert hall, and the bull ring,
and, near by, one can find the interactive Museum
of the Wind.</P>

<P>"Not surprisingly, the population of La Muela has
tripled. The new town hall, opened four months ago,
is designed on a scale and with an airy elegance
comparable to the new high-speed train station
at Zaragoza. Then there are the holidays. The town
hall has launched a lavish programme of luxury
holidays, undercutting travel agents by arranging
bulk bookings.</P>

<P>"The trips are frequent and exotic. Celina Lobez,
54, wife of La Muela's butcher, sharpens her
knife vigorously as she recounts in ringing tones
the highlights of her trip last year to Brazil.</P>


<P>"'They organised special fiestas for us, and put
out huge banners saying 'Welcome to the people of
La Muela'. There were 240 of us. We flew direct
in a plane specially chartered from Zaragoza.</P>

<P>"'I brought back wonderful souvenirs, precious
stones, emeralds and aquamarines. I'd like to
show you but we're making blood sausage in the back."
<span class="bluetext">((("Brazil," is it?  Huh.)))</span></P>

<P>"She carves a mountain of pork fillets, while
continuing: 'Two years ago, we went to Santo
Domingo, then to Mexico. It was fantastic. 
We stayed in a private bungalow each time. 
In Brazil, we stayed in a five-star hotel. 
I don't know where we'll go this year, but 
I'll sign up anyway.'  <span class="bluetext">(((Too bad jets aren't
windpowered.)))</span></P>

<P>"Her husband, Adalberto, emerges from the back
of the butcher's shop, wiping his arms. 'Those
trips are the best part of the year,' he beams.
'We go with all our friends, including the 
village doctor, so we have our own private doctor.
<span class="bluetext">(((The butcher's got his own private doctor?
Well, takes one to know one, I reckon.)))</span> 
'My sons prefer the winter trips to Finland and
Canada but give me the sun anytime.' He disappears
again.</P>

<P>"Celina hands a packet of pork to a waiting
customer: 'This was a very poor village because
we had nothing but air. They had to bring in
water in lorries and store it in underground
cisterns. There was a lot of poverty. If you
were lucky enough to have land you could grow
olives or cereals. But this land... you have to
work it hard. And when the rains failed there
was no harvest.'   <span class="bluetext">(((Hmmm... well, maybe climate
change will bring them rain and take their wind
away.)))</span></P>

<P>"'I've only got one mill. I wish I had five or six,'
says Teresa Andres, director of La Muela's care
home for the elderly, which the town hall opened
five years ago. 'The wind park has benefited all
of us by producing an economic boom in La Muela.
We have grants for our children to study at
university, a good library, a proper school,
good teachers, all subsidised.'  <span class="bluetext">(((Wow, with
an energy bonanza like that, maybe they can
sponsor their own offshore terrorist groups!)))</span></P>

<P>"In the village bar, El Puerto (the Port), the
walls are hung with oars and lifebelts &ndash; 
incongruously for this arid spot so far from
the sea. Maricarmen Cuartero, 58, and her friend,
Pilar Lopez, 75, order milky coffee and a 
chocolate-covered breakfast bar. Maricarmen
has no land and no windmills, but she enjoys
their benefits. Her son works in the windpark
and last year she joined the trip to Santo Domingo,
which she described as 'gorgeous'.</P>

<P>"'There's been a 360-degree change,' she says as
she dunks her cereal bar into her coffee. 
'Villagers would rather serve wine rather than
water, because water was so precious. The first
thing the town hall did was to bring everybody
piped water. It changed everything.</P>

<P>"'And now,' she says, licking her fingers, 'we're
going to the gymnasium for our pilates class and
then a swim, perhaps a massage. Come on, we'll
take you.'</P>

<P>"A walk back to the village centre, takes the
visitor past street after new street of handsome
two-storey brick villas. Some are still being
built in clouds of dust. Others boast sturdy
oak doors, brass Georgian-style knockers, 
balconies decorated with scarlet bobbing 
geraniums, double garages, and an Audi on 
the forecourt.  <span class="bluetext">(((Note conspicuous lack of
green design here.)))</span></P>

<P>"On a fine spring day, the breeze barely turns
the windmills' giant triple arms that catch your
eye from every direction. They flick lethargically,
hypnotically, against the bright sky. But there's
nothing lethargic about the constant roar of
construction that drowns the birdsong of the
village. Mechanical earth-movers and tractors
trundle to and fro, 4x4s bulge through narrow
lanes, squeezing passers-by against the medieval walls.
<span class="bluetext">(((I wonder if they're emitting more carbon
than they save.)))</span></P>

<P>"Inside the village supermarket, the checkout
operator Maria Pinilla, 27, says she enjoyed her
winter trips to Finland and Canada and wishes she
had more time to spend in the swimming pools and
jacuzzis. She has a minor complaint. 'We need
more social life in the village. At weekends it's
dead. People have bought or rented houses here to
enjoy the benefits of the village, but mostly they
live in Zaragoza. Perhaps it's extra quiet this
week because the abuelos [oldies] are all on a
trip to Tenerife.'</P>

<P>"La Muela's experience, while exceptional, is
not unique. Wind energy is booming in Spain.
The country's production is second in Europe only
to Germany. Eight per cent of Spanish energy is
produced by wind, a level expected to reach 15
per cent by 2010. <span class="bluetext">(((Imagine how various OPEC
members live it up on that 92 percent.)))</span> But
targets are constantly outstripped and predictions
revised upwards as energy companies big and small
scramble for a share of the action.  <span class="bluetext">(((Guess
what &ndash; after the energy revolution, the world
will still be full of energy companies.)))</span></P>

<P>"Environmental campaigners welcome the accelerated
drive towards wind power. 'We support wind energy
because it's clean and renewable, and we want
this kind of power to replace dirtier and more
dangerous forms like nuclear,' says Carlos Martin,
a spokesman in Aragon for the campaigning group
Ecologists in Action. 'But we don't want windmills
installed in places of natural value or special
interest and we have campaigned successfully
in many cases against windfarms. We've negotiated
with the companies to protect birds' migration
routes. We think the risk to bird movements is
mostly not great.'  <span class="bluetext">(((It kills me that these
daffy Audubon characters imagine that spinning
metal blades compare to the utter 
ornithological mayhem of oil spills.)))</span></P>
<P>"Some critics &ndash; although there are none to be found in La Muela &ndash; argue that the windmills are visually 
  obtrusive. Mr Martin counters: 'The visual impact
  of a thermal or nuclear plant is much more obtrusive.
  And a windpark can be dismantled without leaving
  contaminated waste which lasts for a millennium.'
  <span class="bluetext">(((Maybe they can make nuclear plants that
  resemble giant trees.)))</span><br>

<P>"Opposite La Muela's town hall (and funded by it)
is the cool and airy cultural centre, where elderly
men concentrate on card games. Posters in the
hallway invite you to sign up for English classes,
music lessons, computer courses, tailoring and
furniture restoration. Upstairs, in a studio with
a door open to a terrace, Evani Sebastian, 39,
supervises a women's art workshop. Evani is among
those who returned to La Muela, reversing the
dispiriting trend of depopulation that blights
small villages throughout rural Spain.</P>

<span class="bluetext">(((But WHY is depopulation blighting rural Spain?
Irrepressible heretic Stewart Brand: 'Most 
environmentalists still haven't got the word.
Worldwide, birthrates are in free fall. Around
one-third of countries now have birthrates below
replacement level (2.1 children per woman) and
sinking. Nowhere does the downward trend show
signs of leveling off. Nations already in a birth
dearth crisis include Japan, Italy, Spain, Germany,
and Russia &ndash; whose population is now in absolute
decline and is expected to be 30 percent lower by
2050.")))</span></P>

<P>"'My parents left for Zaragoza when I was little,
and used their house here only for the summer.
But I decided to come back, so I did up the old
house and settled in it. I've got two small
children in the local school, so I'm helping to
bring life back to the village,' she says.</P>

<P>"'My aunt has six windmills. That means someone
with a basic pension of some ?400 a month now has
extra ?1,000 monthly, or more. That's a big
increase. People here are austere folk, used to
a hard life, and don't change their habits. But
they indulge themselves with more parties, 
foreign trips, a better car.'</P>

<P>"Evani, too, enjoyed the village outing to Santo
Domingo two years ago, and to EuroDisney four
years ago. Like many, she struggles to remember
other tempting trips on offer, and recalls one
to the Arctic to see the House of Father Christmas.
'The council chartered a flight to the funeral of
the Pope,' she adds, 'but they closed the airport
in Rome so it had to be cancelled.'  <span class="bluetext">(((Which
phenomenon do you think will vanish first: the
North polar ice cap, or the Papacy?)))</span></P>

<P>"The fact that villagers travel together 
encourages them to sign up, she says. 'My mother
is a widow, and would never travel on her own.
But she has a companion and they travel together,
and she never misses the annual holidays to
Benidorm and the Canaries.'</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
  <P>"Evani owes her council-funded job &ndash; teaching 
  some 40 women basketmaking, collage and painting &ndash;
  to the windmill money. 'It's been well organised,
  a long-term investment that benefits us all.'</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>"She urges me to stay until sunset, to see the
horizon dotted with points of light, 'like 
Martians landing. It's beautiful'.</P>

<P>"But it's still sunny when I leave, and I meet
Alfonso Arroyo, 89, in one of the streets. 
He's too old to travel now, he confesses, and
he long gave up cultivating his small plot. But
he reflects with pleasure that, with one windmill,
his land is more profitable now than in all the
decades he toiled on it by himself with only the
help of a horse and cart."</P>
