<h2>Viridian Note 00442: Redesigning Iowa</h2>

<P><strong>Key concepts:</strong> new urbanism, Iowa, state initiatives<BR></P>

<P><strong>Attention Conversation Notice:</strong> "Iowa."  Where's that?
Do they mean "Ohio"?  We always get those confused.</P>

<P>Holy cow! Modeling virtual cities in mere minutes with
dual lasers!<BR>

<P>Hi Bruce,</P>

<P>Longtime member of the Viridian list here.
I reside in Clinton, Iowa, population 28,000.

<P>Recently, our Governor, Tom Vilsak signed an
executive order establishing The Iowa Great
Places Initiative. In short, this process will
pick three visionary plans for transforming and
enhancing Iowa "Great Places" and then put
$12-20M worth of state departmental money at
the dispoal of the winners to bring these
ideas to fruition.</P>

<P>Link:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.iowagreatplaces.gov">http://www.iowagreatplaces.gov</A></P>

<P>"Great Places" is designed to make good places
great by bringing together the resources of state
government to build capacity in communities,
regions, neighborhoods or districts that cultivate
the unique and authentic qualities that make
places special: engaging experiences; rich,
diverse populations &amp; cultures; a vital, creative
economy; clean and accessible natural and built
environments; well-designed infrastructure; and
a shared attitude of optimism that welcomes new
ideas, based on a diverse and inclusive cultural
mosaic.</P>

<P>At the request of Governor Tom Vilsack, government
agencies will work together as true partners with
three "pilot" great places (to be selected
throughout the state), to stimulate ideas and
planning, streamline access to available state
resources, help leverage local and private
resources, and share technical expertise.</P>

<p>The Great Places initiative will also bolster
the state's other successful economic tools like
Vision Iowa and the Iowa Values Fund.</p>

<P>Both our local planning committee and the
statewide selection committee are made up of
mostly non-political, young professionals under
the age of 40. In Iowa, where the median age is
36.6 years and rising, this is a HUGE deal.
One looks at the makeup of the selection panel and
the language and incredible open-endedness of
the proposal documents, this initiatives simply
screams New Green Urban Planning. A Daniel Burnham
meets Viridian-type vision, if you will.</P>

<P>Oh, and the deadline for initial applications is
June 31, with final selections to be done by
September. This is lightning fast stuff by anyone's
standards, especially government.</P>

<P>What we'd like to do is to invite some of the best
minds in sustainable urban planning and design
to work with us on a submission that ties several
existing and planned riverfront and neighborhood
redevelopment projects together into a "grand arc"
from Eagle Point park (a beautiful WPA-era park)
in the far North down the riverfront through the
Lyons and Clinton downtown areas and then west
along the Highway 30/Camanche Avenue corridor.
Substantial sections of the latter are undergoing
redevelopment planning. The proposal could include
not only a Burnhamesque grand plan but one or
possibly two "anchor" projects. Currently in the
planning stages are a new municipal libary and
a Sawmill Museum == in the late 1800's Clinton was
the lumber capitol of the U.S. with more millionaires per capita than anywhere in the U.S.</P>

<P>I'm really quite excited about this chance to
bring real worldchanging ideas to Middle America.
Do you think you can help us with some initial
contacts or suggestions of people we should be
bothering? I'm also sending basically a duplicate
of this letter to the folks over at worldchanging.</P>

<P>Best regards,</P>
