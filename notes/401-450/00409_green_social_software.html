<P>"Dear Bruce,</P>

<P>"We are at a critical moment in the fight to undo
global warming!"  <strong>(((I don't want to sound all
politically cynical, but suppose we <em>lose</em>
this "critical moment." Does that mean we
oughta concede defeat and give up fighting
the Greenhouse Effect?)))</strong></P>

<P>"Last October, the Climate Stewardship Act won
a surprising 43 votes in the Senate. While that
was an important moral victory &ndash; we need 51 votes
to win the real victory. Grassroots support will
be critical to hitting 51 votes next time!"</P>

<P><strong>(((Let me page the many Europeans on Viridian List.
Europeans, suppose that you were an American Senator.
I know that's farfetched and kind of repugnant, but &ndash;
if you were, don't you think you'd just blandly contact
some Yankee zillionaire's Political Action Committee
and <STRONG>buy</STRONG> yourself some "grassroots support"? That's
pretty much the way politics runs in the modern USA,
right?  Are you kind of amazed that some Americans
don't seem to get this yet?)))</strong></P>

<P>"The momentum is building across the country
for action on global warming, but we need to
turn up the heat to win! <strong>(((Hey, uh, nice metaphor.)))</strong></P>

<P>"One way to help: sign up for the Environmental
Defense Meetup and get together with people
in your local community to get more active
on global warming. The next Meetup is April 28,
so sign up today:<BR>
<A HREF="http://actionnetwork.org/ct/O716sGE10jb2/">http://actionnetwork.org/ct/O716sGE10jb2/</A></P>


<P><strong>(((This part is novel and therefore kind of
interesting.  Maybe some day some community
will get toasted by an insane greenhouse
heatwave, and then some org like Environmental
Defense will throw a MeetUp, and there will
be some kind of total flashmob freak scene,
and half the city will show up.)))</strong></P>

<P>"Over 4,500 people have already signed up
across the country.  <strong>(((Y'know what?
Viridian List is almost half that size,
and we don't even have a budget!)))</strong>
And last month, hundreds of supporters in
80 cities  attended Environmental Defense Meetups
to get more active to undo global warming &ndash;
and had a great time! Sign-up today!</P>

<P>"To sign up go to:<BR>
<A HREF="http://actionnetwork.org/ct/O716sGE10jb2/">http://actionnetwork.org/ct/O716sGE10jb2/</A></P>


<P>"Next MeetUp: Wednesday, April 28 at 7pm.
Where: Your Community (You help decide)
What: Meet New People &amp; Get More Active on Global Warming</P>

<P>"Sign up, or find out more about Environmental Defense Meetup at
<A HREF="http://actionnetwork.org/ct/Wd16sGE10jbx/">http://actionnetwork.org/ct/Wd16sGE10jbx/</A></P>

<P>Warning sensors</P>

<P>Someone coming &ndash; recluse, someone on the lam, paranoiac &ndash; unwanted person at the door, on the grounds, within the perimeter aroma as "silent" alarm.</p>

<P>Secured area soaked by Aromatizer. Intruder,
cannot avoid being invisibly, silently scented
while crossing certain halls or rooms.
(Clinging smells cannot be turned off
like burglar alarm, cannot be easily cleaned)</P>

<p>Self-defense vest: get grabbed from behind and a puke-inducing gas sprays the offender.</p>

<P>Smell dangerous airborne chemicals that you wouldn't
smell otherwise &ndash; CO, radon &ndash; sensor
attached to Aromatizer</P>

<p>Scent ID tags &ndash; how can you be sure that guy's
  not walking out of the cafe with your ibook
  (they all look alike)? Make him tell you
&ndash; how it's supposed to smell &ndash; pine? no,
  it's bananas.  Sorry, you lose.</p>


<P>Dial-a-cologne</P>

<P>necklace, undershirt, belt, bracelet &ndash;
punch in to have sophisticated scents
emitted, always appropriate 
to changing social situations</P>

<P>also useful in bordellos too rushed to
give their prostitutes time to shower
(quite water-conserving that way)</P>

<p>Wake: The deceased have an odd non-smell. Why not
  tuck one of these gizmos in an inside jacket pocket
  and let them smell the way that they did when alive.</p>
  
<p>Smell-o-gram: forget sending some corny email
  greeting card, send your friends a card
  that emits the smell of fresh paella!</p>
  
<P>Emit gasefied pharmaceuticals while you sleep.
Medical inhaler with low-concentration, long duration applications &ndash; for chronic diseases,
 to treat allergies, to change body chemistry.</P>

<P>People on respirators (e.g. in a hospital).
Give them pharmaceuticals right through the
breathing apparatus &ndash; clean, no need to inject
and break the skin (useful in non-hygeinic areas).
Also won't upset the stomach the way
that pills can.  Computer-regulated dosages.</P>

<p>Positive reinforcement: (all-drug sports leagues)
  football player crosses the goal line,
  gets a huff of mistified methamphetamine.</p>


<P>Aromatizer combined with ancillary lines
of clothing/lingerie/tattoos that react to aromas.</P>

<P>Aromatizer peripherals change color, light up,
sparkle, go translucent/transparent, disintegrate,
change flavor</P>

<P>Surreptitious tracking devices</P>

<P>For tracking by dogs.</P>

<P>Emits a gas odorless to humans, but easy
for police dogs to sense (or emits a gas to
be sensed by computer). Track the person &ndash;
they can be tagged with airborne molecules.</P>

<P>Who used this computer workstation? (Telltale
scent from machine makes it useless to
erased all of the log files.  Each scent is
unique to each computer -- that way, can
correlate the person's use of a particular machine).
Similar tracking applications for closed cars,
closed offices, or intimate contact with another
human being.</P>

<p>For the hearing-impaired: scent 
  means phone's ringing, someone's at the door,
  kitchen timer, you've got mail Blind people navigate new buildings:
  braille pda lists rooms and scents.
  Person wants the bathroom, the commissary,
  the elevator, a particular office, pushes
  the button for the place and navigates by smell</p>

<P>Bio-sensor senses that a person's going to
have a seizure, senses it beforehand, emits a
smell, person knows to prepare himself</P>

<P>bio-sensors (urine check) for fertility, cancer,
malnutrition, blood-sugar problems, etc.  etc.
a scent is much nicer than an<BR>
alarm or a flashing light or whatever.</P>

<P>Build a whole host of Pavlovian responses based
on Aromatizer smells.</P>

<P>Train people/animals, whatever, to do
(fill in response here) whenever they smell,
say, bubble gum (there's a whole Manchurian Candidate problem here)</P>

Food education &ndash; learn to cook well, or brew beer
  correctly, or drink wine like a connoisseur:
  learn what these products should
  smell like when they are done perfectly.
  Compare and contrast.

<P>Commercial tie-in with cooking or cook-book programs.</P>

<P>Also good for restaurants &ndash; preview its dishes by smell &ndash; from the comfort of your home computer.</P>

<p>fire alarm in hotel: "real" smoke smell
  gets people awake and out of their rooms
  (no laggards figuring that it's a false alarm,
  drinking beer and waiting out the sirens).</p>

<P>A Viridian olfactory plug-in module, managing
energy generation.  Located in the
central fuse-box of a house: it would emit its
scents, whenever  the owner wandered by.</P>

<P>It would create the smell of:<BR>
Ozone: showing the amount of power consumed
at the moment in the house<BR>
Honey: the amount of power generated by the
house's own devices (example: solar panels)
Tar: the amount of power brought in to the system
from the fossil-fueled grid<BR>
Fetidness: the amount of power consumed in the
house by vampire electrical devices in pointless
"standby mode".</P>

<P>Another idea: the smelling-salts alarm device.</P>

<P>It would emit a powerful ammoniac smell
that makes you become fully alert very quickly.
To be used by in-plane or in-car systems,
to resurrect unconscious pilots after a
multi-G turn, or  to waken narcoleptic drivers
before they run off the highway.</P>

<P>Yay, another contest. It has been too long.</P>

<P>"Word of Nose" &ndash; approval-disapproval rating mechanism(s)...</P>

<P>This would be particularly useful for modern day
protesters who are no longer let anywhere near
the people they disapprove of. Form a long line
of disapprovers (or enter the meeting hall), and
then you and your cohorts let rip.</P>

<P>At a concert, or a lecture, send off a pleasant odor
appreciating the performance. No more annoying clapping.</P>

<P>If a bad restaurant smells funny (or perhaps doesn't
smell at all), your knowing fellow customers
will back out sooner than they would otherwise.</P>

<P>of course, restaurants and such might start to buy
maskers or their own scents to counter-act the
ratings. Connoisseurs could leave scent trails
through the city. Tourists would follow their noses.</P>

<P>adrian cotter</P>

<P>p.s. Mr Groepler should read Mark Budz's book Clade,
where society's structure and relationships are
directed through pheromones and other nose/skin
ingested molecules.  Also the book Perfume by Peter Suskind.</P>

  <P>ReFresh Aromatizer: Follow Your Nose (TM)</P>

<P>Walk smoothly through noxious clouds of
an all-too-organic 21st Century, when you plug
in your ReFresh Aromatizer.</P>

<P>Like noise-cancelling headphones, these Viridian
noseplugs resynthesize smells <STRONG>opposite</STRONG> to the
odors in the environment. They're totally porous,
allowing breath to be drawn naturally, as well
as allowing undistorted speech. But they emit
enough countersmell to neutralize the odor
in the air, while you are working/playing/sleeping
in stinky conditions. A gateway to freshness you can trust.</P>

<P>A Bluetooth device, ReFresh works in conjunction
with a mobile phone, as well as optional Bluetooth
glasses and headphones. The countersmell itself
is determined by wireless Internet lookup in a
GIS database of GPS:odor factors.</P>

<P>ReFresh biometric field teams have already mapped
the most notorious stinkholes in cities, suburbs,
malls and industrial sites around the world,
seeding the odorBase.</P>

<P>Sniffing your way off the beaten path, at a
jobsite or new clearcut? A Bluetooth sensor
on your belt dynamically samples the air
thousands of times a second, with a laser
spectrum analyzer, keeps you up to date in
our peer-to-peer community of noses-about-town.</P>

<P>Certain neighborhoods are so moldy and nasty
as to be uninsurable and therefore uninhabitable.
For you, though, these cheap locales are
as fresh as a baby's bottom, thanks to
ReFresh protection. Toxic clouds are
flagged, allowing prudent navigation to breathable
areas, as shown clearly on your phone.</P>

<P>With ReFresh as your guide, you're always
in the clear.</P>

<P>The Aromaker</P>

<P>(Ad for boys)</P>

<P>Hey boys! Remember that really really gross smell
you wanted to save so you could share it with your friends?</P>

<P>Well, now you can! The Aromaker (a doglike robot)
has a sense of smell unparalleled in the natural
world. It will analyze the smell, record it,
and generate it on demand whenever you ask.</P>

<P>Want to stink up your sister's room?
Get some dirty socks, give them to the Aromaker,
and have it sneak in and release the odor!</P>

<P>Think of the possibilities! Recording a smell
is as easy as telling your Aromaker to
"Record Skunk!" (or Dirty Socks or Mud)
and the playback command is "Play Skunk!"</P>

<P>(Ad for girls)</P>

<P>Hey girls! Don't you hate it when you
have to deal with those smelly boys?
Well, now you won't have to!</P>

<P>The Aromaker can make any room smell pleasant.
Give it a scent that you like, and it can
record it and later replicate that scent
whenever you want, flooding the room with
sweet perfume, wiping out the smell of your brother.</P>

<P>Never deal with a smelly room ever again with your Aromaker!</P>

<P>Ad for parents</P>

<P>While your kids may enjoy the Aromaker
for its possibilities of fun, you can rest easy
while they're playing with it. The Aromaker is
programmed to detect several dangerous gases,
such as sarin gas or chlorine gas, and
automatically goes into protection mode,
generating enough oxygen for your child to breathe.</P>

<P>It will not generate sarin or chlorine,
no matter what the suggestion.<BR>
It will also faithfully lead your child
to safety away from dangerous fumes.</P>

<P>So while your kids are playing pranks
on each other with their new toy,
they're protected from extreme dangers.
In an uncertain world filled with terrorists
who have demonstrated their willingness to
use any tool, won't you feel safer if your
child is protected by an Aromaker?</P>

<P>Pope-Emperor,</P>

<P>My beloved is very poor at turning off lights
when she leaves a room. Now our watts come from
a renewable electricity supplier, so all we're
doing is sending them more money, but it
would be nice to have some sort of reminder.</P>

<P>The Viridian Power-scent solves this problem.
When a room is vacated for longer than the
set time-out (default 5 minutes), the
Power-scent starts to emit an odour
(odour is user selectable from a wide range).
The odour intensity increases over the
following hour, propagating throughout
the dwelling, and providing an olfactory
clue that there is a light which has been
left on elsewhere.</P>

<P>Of course, the optimal use of this is
for a third party walking through a
front door, and getting to say: "Oh my god!
The smell! Who's left a light on?"</P>

<P>The mechanism can be expanded to any
electrical appliance, but only<BR>
technology I have which is currently
signalling its status via olfactory means
is my cat's litter tray.</P>

<P>Here's a few ideas for the aromatizer device:</P>

<P>Use the device as a diet aid; smell is a
significant portion of taste,<BR>
can you use smell &ndash; or lack thereof &ndash;
to eliminate the body's need to have food?
Smell also has power over emotional states,
what if you could trigger smells to create
a full feeling or a not-hungry feeling?</P>

<P>Contrawise, use the device to enhance an
otherwise bland meal &ndash; put in<BR>
savory and appealing smells into
your system without having to spend money
on expensive foods.</P>

<P>Use the device as a dating service.
According to this site:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.cf.ac.uk/biosi/staff/jacob/teaching/sensory/olfact1.html">http://www.cf.ac.uk/biosi/staff/jacob/teaching/sensory/olfact1.html</A></P>


<P>smell can trigger positive responses from other
people as potential mates. People seem to be
attracted to people with opposing immunotypes,
which exude a particular smell.</P>

<P>Use it for long distance produce assessment.
Coffee, tea, wines, and some types of produce
are judged based partially &ndash; if not
completely &ndash; on smell. With this device,
you might be able to produce a<BR>
system which sends the smell across
communication devices.</P>
