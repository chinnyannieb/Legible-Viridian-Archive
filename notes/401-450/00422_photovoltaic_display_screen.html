<P>"PV-TV: A Multifunctional, Eco-Friendly Building Material</P>

<P>"By Eliza Barclay<BR>
Posted July 27, 2004</P>

<P>"A skyscraper's exterior skin adds structural
support and helps maintain the building's internal
temperature; some skins also offer aesthetic value,
shimmering in the light and reflecting the landscape
in pleasing ways. But what if a skyscraper's outside
wrapping could take a more active role in sustaining
the building's operational needs and engaging
passers-by?</P>

<P>"One result might be PV-TV. Developed last year by
the Tokyo-based MSK Corporation in conjunction with
chemical company Kaneka and Japanese architecture firm
Taiyo Industries, this amorphous silicon technology has
a 'three-in-one' functionality: it is able to act as a
glazing element, solar panel, and video display screen." <span class="bluetext">(((Yowza!)))</span></P>

<P>"The panels, which are 980mm long and 950mm wide,
come in a standard depth of 10mm thick, as well as in
a 13mm-thick, strengthened-glass option.</P>

<P>"As an external glaze, PV-TV allows up to 10% visible
light to be transmitted through the panel. This level
of light transmission is optimal to allow sufficient
light in cloudy conditions while protecting against
excessive solar gain and ultraviolet rays. It can
provide thermal insulation and replace top lights,
eaves, windows, and/or curtain walls.</P>

<P>"As a solar photovoltaic (PV) panel, PV-TV can generate
3.8 watts of electricity per square foot, an above-
average level of efficiency. Furthermore, unlike other
PV systems, these panels are transparent and can be
integrated into almost any part of a building without
obscuring light or ruining the building's aesthetic
appearance, two downsides of conventional PV panels.
<span class="bluetext">(((Oh come on, panels don't "ruin" anybody's
appearance.)))</span></P>

<P>"But PV-TV's most unusual feature is its ability to
act as a full-color internal and external screen.
<span class="bluetext">(((Now we're talkin'. All day they generate energy
and are kind of 90 percent cloudy gray, and then at
night you can <STRONG>beam TV through them!</STRONG>)))</span></P>

<P>"A picture or advertisement projected from inside a
structure can be seen within that building, with PV-TV
acting as a regular display screen. On the outside of
the building, the material can function as a giant
billboard.</P>

<P>"Since the PV-TV screens don't have the luminosity
of liquid crystalline or a digital TV screen, they
perform best when there are no other competing light
sources, according to MSK spokeswoman Aya Tanida.
<span class="bluetext">(((All night, they could spew giant copies of
your weblog at awestruck passers-by.)))</span></P>

<P>"Currently, there are a few projects within Japan
where PV-TV has been applied. One is MSK's own factory
in Nagano, where various components of MSK's solar
modules are manufactured. The factory is now the
world's largest single PV module plant, producing
100 megawatts of energy annually. <span class="bluetext">(((Imagine the
joy of using your solar TV panels to broadcast
the future Hague showtrials of the board of
directors of ExxonMobil.)))</span></P>

<P>"Though PV-TV has yet to gain popularity outside
of Japan, <span class="bluetext">(((okay, Viridians, go make them trendy)))</span>
MSK still has high hopes for the global market.
The company recently opened an office in London and
says it will heavily market all of its PV products
to European companies. <span class="bluetext">(((Blight-stricken Yankees
are insufficiently cool for this technology.)))</span></P>

<P>"Could PV-TV have a future in the U.S.? According
to Paul Maycock, of PV Energy Systems, Inc., it is
uncertain. One stumbling block is how difficult it
is to quantify the product's value versus its price.
<span class="bluetext">(((Oh who CARES! It's a projection screen that
generates power!)))</span> (Right now, the technology is
priced at $45 per square foot.) <span class="bluetext">(((Americans still
measure in 'feet.')))</span> But that said, Maycock adds,
'Whoever heard of a curtain wall that pays for itself?
It's a great idea to do something with the skin of the
building besides just keeping the heat load down.'</P>
