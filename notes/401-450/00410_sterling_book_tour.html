the urge to press-the-flesh of the Pope-Emperor

you are local media, then the estimable Mr. Robbins
of Del Rey publicity  would rather  like a word

<P>Dear BruceS,</P>


<P>Here are my Viridian atomizer application contest
entries.</P>

<OL type="1" start="1">
  <LI VALUE="1">
  Hacker crime retardant. When a hacker compromises
  a system, the atomizer emits pepper spray, or worse,
  a permanent red dye-type mist that marks (brands,
  tattoos) the hacker, enabling easier identification
  by feds &amp; court jurors. The Aromatizer would be a
  standard incorporation into Windows/Mac boxes,
  which might spur a new Linux/Unix movement.
  <BR><BR></LI>

  <LI VALUE="2">
  Spymatizer. Spyware could digitize sample smells
  from households (like baby smells, pet smells, smoker
  smells), then beam the info back to headquarters.
  Headquarters then targets ads to the computer user.</LI>

</OL>

<P>What if you were using a laptop in Central Park by
the horse carriages?</P>

<OL type="1" start="3">
  <LI VALUE="3">
  The Net for Dogs. Based on smells, dogs could be
  taught interactive computing. Bark once for poo,
  three times for Alpo Doggie Steak. Voice input would
  then translate the barks into signal input. Could be
  used as spyware for dog food ads.
  <BR><BR></LI>

  <LI VALUE="4">
  Google for Smells. A smell-mixer program, similar
  to a sound-mixer program, could be used to key in
  smells. Use of created digitized smells would include
  input to Google to search the Net for corresponding
  smells. I'd like to see the SmellRank code for that.
  You would just link to smells the usual way, via
  hyperlink.</LI>

</OL>


<P>Eventually, SmellRank code could locate smells on
or off the web, over the whole globe.</P>

<P>Smell viruses would invade us as spammers/hackers
learned to target the personal smells of certain
people.</P>

<P>Bruce,</P>

<P>I took a bunch of photos in India and Thailand over
the last few months.  I'd like an olfactory recorder
on my digital camera.  It would embed the smell data
into the JPEG,  then I can play the photos back on a
digital AV player.</P>

<P>People who had an Aromatizer on their cellphone,
PDA, or desktop could smell the photos off my website
or if I emailed them, since all the data would be part
of the JPEG itself.</P>

<P>Olfactorily yours,</P>

<P>Warren</P>

<P>Bruce,</P>

<P>I really hate to say it, I really do...</P>

<P>"Any technology sufficiently advanced can be used for
porn."</P>

<P>The real money is always in entertainment. Although
adding scent to porn may push people right over the
edge.</P>

<P>Your Holiness-Majesty:</P>

<P>I propose installing scent generators on all electrical
appliances sold (except those under energy-conservation
programs, EnergyStar and the like).  When the offending
appliance begins to draw power, a sulfurous burning-
coal stench would be emitted.</P>

<P>As I'm in the medical field, I had initially thought of
using olfactory cues instead of lights and audio alarms
in patient monitors, but a hospital is already such a
fantasia of aromas that such smell-alerts would be
lost.</P>
