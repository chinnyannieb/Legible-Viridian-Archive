<P>Despite the fact that somebody betrayed
her trust and leaked her email from the
Davos Forum of 2003, so that it spread
worldwide like some out-of-control virus,
noted journalist Laurie Garrett got
to go back to the  Davos Forum in 2004 anyhow!

<P>Now Laurie Garrett is publicly lecturing in Austin.  I'm too embarrassed to go 
apologize to her
about reading her email when it was really none
of my business, but maybe you should.</P>

<P>"Power in Numbers</P>

<P>"Professional associations working together can help all designers become environmental 
stewards"</P>

<P>"A design idea remains just that &ndash; a thought a dream, a projection &ndash; until it materializes.
  The success of the ultimate form often depends
  on the materials chosen.  Every designer knows
  this.  But what they have yet to fully grasp is
  the power their material choices have to change
  the world.  I feel it's my moral duty to call
  attention again and again to this fact.</p>

<P>"Every chance I get I mention the GDP (the Gross
Designed Product) and its implications for our
environmental health and well-being.  The idea of
the GDP is a simple one: architects as well as
designers specializing in interiors, products,
graphics, and landscape are responsible for putting
huge volumes of materials in motion.  They specify</P>



<P>everything from concrete to metal to wood to
synthetics to paper &ndash; myriad products, thousands
with mysterious provenance, suspected of causing
harm to living creatures.</P>


<P>"About 50,000 architects are responsible for
creating USD800 billion worth of construction
projects each year in the United States.  This
is real purchasing power.  And it's only a portion
of the GDP.  Each trade association has its own
measurements of the work its members perform and</P>


<P>by implication the value of the products they
specify.  Together, these organizations &ndash; AIA,
ASID, IIDA, IDSA, AIGA, and others &ndash; can force
the production of environmentally safe, energy=
efficient products.  They're also in the position
to provide research, analysis, and solid information</P>

<P>about the properties and behaviors of materials.
And they can bring together their own experts
with other design professionals as well as those
in the natural and social sciences, thus providing
their combined members with the kind of information
that the citizen designer of the twenty-first
century needs.</P>

<P><b>((("Citizen designer."  Boy, there's a neologism.)))</b></P>

<P>"Though the signs indicate that the old territorial
squabbling between the professions is abating,
this is a fragile truce that must turn into a
peace treaty with a backbone.  Working together,
keeping the power of the GDP in mind, designers
are poised to make a better tomorrow today.  The
next generations will be grateful for their efforts.
And current practitioners will have the satisfaction</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>of knowing they lived up to the mission of every
great designer: to make the world better." &ndash;
