<P>I suggest cayenne pepper spray wake-up and cell-phone
alarms.  Or maybe just  coffee, cinnamon, lemon,
whatever works.</P>

<DL>
  <DT>Defense phones</DT><DD>emitting huge clouds of obscuring
  smoke, or maybe teargas (just spritz a neutralising
  agent in your eyes, nose and throat).
  </DD><DT>Scent tagging</DT><DD>adding scent tags to your graffiti
  and other forms of personal expression.
  </DD></DL>

<P>What does Mars smell like, anyway?  The next Rover
must know.</P>

<P>Ideally, this Aromatizer should be two way, containing
a scent sampler,  so that you would have the ability to
ask remotely located  conversation partners if the
yogurt is off.</P>

<P>With this kind of functionality, hyper-sensitive,
genetically modified  drug sniffing rats (or maybe
just their brains and noses in a vat) could be kept
in hermetically sealed locations and law enforcement
officers could remotely sniff suspicious packages
using cell phones.</P>

<P>The same goes for suspicious packages, and maybe
suspects themselves,  once a scent-bank is up and
running to allow the rats to compare smells.</P>

<P>Outside of homeland security issues, doctors could
get the same rats  (lemurs, whatever works) to
remotely sniff at suspicious tumors,  urine samples,
etc.</P>

<P>Scent-collecting clubs could exchange rare and
complicated scents on the interweb.  Scent symphonies
and other multimedia art forms could  finally become
a mass culture phenomenon.</P>


<P>Perfume police could verify the authenticity of
pirated samples using  wireless access to interweb
data banks.</P>

<P>Assuming we loosen up a little, perhaps heavy doses
of pheremones and aerosoled designer psychedelics
could accompany scent messages,  symphonies,
exclamation marks, etc.</P>

<P>Hi Bruce</P>

<P>I don't know what it's like around your house,
but around here, one of the most boring jobs
every week is getting the family to agree on a
shopping list, based on a weekly menu of dinners.</P>

<P>Hooked up to your TV feed, a vocal stress analyzer,
and an automatic fact checker/verification engine,
the Aromatizer could let you know when something is
a little "smelly" in a news report or politician's
speech.</P>

<P>Outright lies would produce methane, sulfur dioxide,
or similar garbagey/sewery smells.  Overly optimistic
"spin"  would result in overpowering, sickly-sweet
smells, too sweet to be true.</P>

<DL>
  <DT>Informercials would smell like spoiled meat </DT><DD>= baloney,
  to be exact.
  </DD></DL>

<P>Truth would smell like fresh air; hopeful news might
smell like freshly-turned earth.  This application
could also be useful for the blind.</P>

<P>Perhaps, objects that are malfunctioning
could smell bad (or at least, distinct). So: A
roomful of network servers, each with its own USB
Aromatizer dangling out the back.</P>

<P>When a server goes down, it's programmed to start
smelling like a thing that has died. This idea is
based on the notion that it's easier to find
something that's gawdawful offensive than something
that's merely malfunctioning, and you're more
compelled to fix the problem immediately. Of course,
you might want to turn off the Aromatizers for the
weekend, lest things smell reeeeeeely bad when
you get back on Monday.</P>

<P>Two men are in an elevator, waiting to arrive at
their destinations. One looks to the other, with
disdain. The second says, "Oh. Sorry," and removes
a mobile phone from his pocket. He opens it and
starts talking.</P>

<P>The Aromatizer Mobile Phone: Because your farts
aren't the only thing that don't smell.</P>

<P>A more serious use might be to medicate hospital
patients through their air tubes, or to soothe
them with pleasant smells. Instead of a morphine
button, you give them a mown-grass or cedar-forest
button. Obviously this could have larger-scale
applications... Somewhere between the piped-in
aromas in Japanese office buildings and the
poisonous gas jets in James Bond flicks, all
controlled over a Wi-Fi network.</P>

<P>thinkgeek.com will, of course, market a computer
automated Febreeze product. Cuz those nerdy geeks
sometimes forget to bathe.</P>

<P>Thanks for the use of the playground.</P>

<P>Forge Georgeman's Magic Tofu2Meat Machine
(ANIMALA Approved)</P>

<P>Your primitive ancestors roamed the Serengeti,
striking down lions with hand tools and feasting
on their barely cooked flesh.  As a modern human
person, you recognize that killing animals for flesh
is terribly wrong, but still your genes lust after
the delicious taste of a grilled steak.</P>

<P>Well, lust no more, because Forge Georgeman's
Magic Tofu2Meat Machine (ANIMALA Approved) will
transform your boring old tofu into a delicious
simulated beef steak, chicken breast, or lamb steak.</P>

<P>Using patented technology from Headspace Technologies
in Austin Texas, Forge Georgeman's Magic Tofu2Meat
Machine will infuse your tofu with scientifically
calibrated scents to make it taste just like real
meat.  Its microscopic mandibles will rapidly shape
stale tofu into a delicious fleshy, stringy texture
virtually identical to your target meat.  Look, see,
smell, taste, chew, and enjoy the delicious smoky
aroma of your simulated meat knowing that no animal
was harmed in its construction.</P>

<P>Best of all, ANIMALA has carefully examined and
certified that Forge Georgeman's Magic Tofu2Meat
Machine is 100% free of animal products, and safe
for consumption by almost all vegetarians or vegans.</P>

<P>Dear Bruce</P>

<P>Always a pleasure to hear from you.</P>

<P>Possible applications for the smell-emitting device,
which I see it as an i-Pod like social peripheral.</P>

<P>A gentler "weekend" alarm clock, emitting smell
of coffee or fried bacon at pre set time.</P>

<P>A graduated way of repelling unwanted social and
sexual attentions, emitting first cheap scent,
then mild bad breath smell, then dirty feet and
armpits, finally something approaching skunk-like.</P>

<P>Of course the killer app is something akin to the
sexual scent described by Roald Dahl (I think
in the short story called Sex).</P>

<P>Couple of questions for Mr Groepler.</P>

<P>Does it record, as well?</P>

<P>Does it produce a range of variables,  or is it
charged up with specific smell for single
applications?</P>

<H4>Aromatizer idea == sniffing the ether</H4>
<EM>nsjacobus*yahoo.com (Nigel Jacobus)</EM><BR>

<P>Here's an idea:</P>

<P>Ever heard of a software radio? If not, well, it's
essentially a general-purpose, broad-band radio
transceiver whose characteristics are defined not
in HARDware but in SOFTware. Check it out:
<A HREF="http://www.gnu.org/software/gnuradio">http://www.gnu.org/software/gnuradio</A>.</P>

<P>It's a VERY far-out idea.</P>

<P>At any rate, imagine an Aromatizer hooked up to
a software radio. The Aromatizer would be tuned to
emit certain kinds of smells depending on the kind
of EM-signal it's picking up. Intensity of the
signal would be represented by the intensity of
the smell. This way, with the software radio on
in a passive-mode, one could literally smell strong
GSM or CDMA signals, standard WM/FM signals,
WiFi hotpots, etc. It would be an excellent
hands-off interface for a software-radio.</P>

<P>Indeed, the system could show some smarts such
that if a new kind of signal is received by the
radio (some kind of new device, say) the
Aromatizer could synthesize a brand new smell
by analyzing the signal (with the help of the
software-radio) and then combining previous smells
that correspond to the new signal's component
wave-forms.</P>

<P>Indeed, this approach could be used in the
not-too-distant future when we are covered in
ubicomp devices. Imagine that two such-equipped
people meet. They want to know if they can trust
each other to conduct some transaction. The
respective "Whuffie" scores or other Reputation
index is converted into a smell by each other's
Aromatizer/SoftwareRadio rig. They literally smell
each other to determine trustworthiness! Just like
a pair of hounds!</P>

<P>A step further in this direction would be to use
smells and some kind of crypto system as the basis
for all identification situations.</P>

<P>Cheers,<BR>
Nigel.</P>

<P>Bruce,</P>

<P>My GSM Motorola Quad Band V600 already will blink
different colors and flash different pictures linked
to the incoming number. Having it emit the favorite
perfume of the caller might help my sense memory when
I answer. Sometimes I get Natasha and Natalia confused.</P>

<P>You have probably encountered the same smoke filled
cafes, streets and elevators of Europe that I am
exposed to. For all their civilization, the Europeans
just have not picked up on the "tobacco is noxious"
idea.</P>

<P>A pleasant  eucalyptus might mask the second
hand smoke or, fighting fire with fire, a methane
aroma, somewhat like necrotic bowels, might be
irritating enough to get the smokers to leave.</P>

<P>What propelled the comic-novelty business, for
however long? Seventy-five years? Ninety?</P>

<P>The Joy-Buzzer and the Whoopee cushion, that's what!</P>

<P>And what would be the internet version of the
Whoopee cushion? That's right!  The Remote Fart
Machine, that's what!</P>

<P>Just as the pr0n industry pioneered the way for
profitable internet sales, the Remote Fart Machine
can re-vitalize moribund Smell-O-Vision technology.</P>
