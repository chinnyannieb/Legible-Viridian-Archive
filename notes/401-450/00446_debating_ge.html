<P>Frank O'Donnell, Clean Air Watch</P>

<h2>GE's Greenwashing</h2>
<p>by Frank O'Donnell<br>
May 13, 2005</P>

<P><em>"Frank O'Donnell is president of? Clean Air Watch,
a 501 (c) 3 non-partisan, non-profit organization
aimed at educating the public about clean air and
the need for an effective Clean Air Act."</em></P>

<P>
"You might call it 'Extreme Makeover: Corporate
Edition.' Or, perhaps, simply 'greenwashing.'</P>

<P>"General Electric, the conglomerate whose environmental legacy has been dominated by its poisoning of the
Hudson River with PCBs &ndash; and its reluctance to clean
up the damage &ndash; is turning over a green new leaf.
Or so the company claims.?</P>

<P>"But even while GE was hosting was hosting a glitzy
cocktail reception to roll out a new pro-environmental
PR and ad campaign,  <span class="bluetext">(((hey, a glitzy cocktail
reception, wait a minute, how come nobody invited me,
me me me)))</span>  the company was working behind closed doors in Congress to secure another delay in
cleaning up the Hudson &ndash; a cleanup that is
supposed to cost the company half a billion dollars.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Congress people much prefer closed doors in
Congress, because politicians hate to be blindsided.</P>

<P>If you tell a politician, in public, anything that
surprises them  &ndash; any important issue that leaves
them flatfooted and without a set political
stance for a calculated response &ndash; then they
will presume you've done that on purpose.  They
presume that you did it to humiliate them, and to demonstrate boorish contempt for the sea of
insider buzz in which they marinate themselves.
That's why, if you've got any sense inside the
Beltway, you leak your intentions to the junior staffers first.)))</span>

"Let's start with the May 9 debut of the company's
'Ecomagination' campaign &ndash; a $90 million PR blitz
aimed at remaking the company's soiled image into
one colored bright green:? Expensive print ads show
leaves sprouting from electric power plants; a
green airplane floats across a corporate website
behind the online greeting by CEO Jeffrey Immelt;
a television commercial features buff models posing
as coal miners &ndash; essentially a mini-music video
reminiscent of Madonna's 'Express Yourself.'</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((For an avant-garde music video to become
a means of mainstream corporate PR strikes me
as the healthy sign of a functional social order.
It may be that Madonna's really upset that her
decade-old caperings are considered sexy
in GE's corporate boardrooms.  Maybe someone
should ask Madonna about that.  I doubt that
she goes to "Clear Air Watch" for assessments
of her artistic intent.)))</span></P>

<P>"The frivolous quality of the advertising undercuts
GE's serious message: ''Increasingly for business,
'green' is green,' noted Immelt. 'We're at a tipping
point where energy efficiency and emission reductions
equal profitability.'   <span class="bluetext">(((I frankly find it priggish
and reactionary for the president of Clean Air Watch
to scold GE as "frivolous".  I bet Clean Air Watch
would sell a lot more  coffee-cups if they
themselves took cues from Madonna.)))</span></P>

<P>"The GE executive announced the company would double
by 2010 its annual $700 million spending on research
and development of eco-friendly products, and would
double its revenue from those products by 2015.
Included are efforts to develop solar and wind energy, as well as an advanced coal process
supported &ndash; in concept &ndash; by environmentalists.
<span class="bluetext">((( Way too many "environmentalists" would rather
"support a concept" than take any genuine
steps to transform actual industries.)))</span></P>

<P>"In a move applauded by environmentalists (particularly
the World Resources Institute, a think tank that
receives support from GE and helped devise the
new corporate strategy), GE promised to reduce the
greenhouse gas emissions from its operations by one
percent by 2012.  It said those emissions would
increase by 40 percent without the initiative.
And Immelt said in interviews that he would like
Congress to include 'clear milestones' to reduce
greenhouse gas emissions as part of energy legislation.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((The subtext here is Clear Air Watch's lip-biting envy of World Resources Institute and their big fat GE
corporate grant.  And small wonder &ndash;  GE's got a PR
budget of NINETY MILLION DOLLARS!  Man, ExxonMobil
dropped a mere eight million bucks on their
brown anti-eco initiatives, and think of the
results they got &ndash; ExxonMobil may have fried
the planet practically single-handed.  For ninety
million, GE ought to be able to hire every enviro
NGO in the world.)))</span>

"Even though the Bush administration quickly sought
to associate itself with the company &ndash; 'We sort of
view G.E.'s pledge as the president's climate policy
put into practice,' DOE Assistant Secretary David
Garman told The New York Times  &ndash; GE does seem to
be taking a more proactive position on global warming than President Bush (to whom Immelt made campaign
contributions). Likewise for Bush's chief environmental
apologist, James Connaughton, who was a GE lobbyist
before becoming chairman of the White House Council
on Environmental Quality and who attended the May 9
cocktail reception.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Look: if you'd prefer to die of climate change
rather than touch anyone who ever speaks to George W.
Bush, why not just say that?  It's not like
Bush lacks for enemies willing to commit
self-righteous public suicide.)))</span></P>

<P>"At first glance, the company also seems to be breaking
both in style and substance with former CEO Jack Welch,
who notes in his most recent book, Winning, that
'Business is a game, and winning that game is a total
blast!'  <span class="bluetext">(((Is it supposed to be news that Jack Welch
is a businessman?  Jack Welch is THE businessman.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((I've got better tittle-tattle, check this out:
Jack Welch is a testosterone-crazed over-achiever
who is so dynamically charismatic that the business
press literally has affairs with him.)))</span><br>

<P>"However, GE asserts that it really plans is to
'build on its legacy of success' with environmental
products. There is more than a little truth to
that claim: GE has lobbied for years for federal
subsidies for nuclear power, 'clean coal' and other
products, and seems to be positioning itself now
to argue that nuclear power should be part of any
global warming slowdown strategy."</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((In a word, yes.  Brace yourself, here come the
anti-carbon nukes.)))</span>
<br><a href="http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/05/05/issue/feature_earth.asp">http://www.technologyreview.com/articles/<br>05/05/issue/feature_earth.asp</A>
<span class="bluetext">(((At the moment, this TECHNOLOGY REVIEW site
is running a GE Ecomagination promotional banner.)))</span></P>

<P>"But it's an unfortunate reference, given the company's
sorry history of dealing with the environment.</P>

<P>"For example, in 1986, Congressman Edward Markey,
D-Mass., disclosed that while running the Hanford
Nuclear Reservation, the company had conducted
experiments on hundreds of United States citizens
whom Markey described as 'nuclear calibration devices
for experimenters run amok.'</P>

<P>"One of GE's most gruesome experiments was performed
on inmates at a prison in Walla Walla, Wash., near
Hanford. Starting in 1963, 64 prisoners had their
scrotums and testes irradiated to determine the
effects of radiation on human reproductive organs.
<span class="bluetext">(((You know it's a great below-the-belt scandal
when it's been  rattling around in America's nuclear
closet since 1963.)))</span></P>

<P>"GE has clashed with the federal government on air
pollution policy issues. <span class="bluetext">(((Look, the "federal
government" was also running Hanford.  GE can
clash with feds or collaborate with feds, but
they can't be dissed for both clashing and
collaborating.)))</span>  In 2000, the company hired noted
'liberal' constitutional scholar Laurence Tribe of
Harvard to file a friend-of-the-court brief with
the Supreme Court opposing EPA's clean air standards
for smog and soot. Fortunately, the Supreme Court
unanimously rejected GE's dirty-air approach.
<span class="bluetext">(((I'm sorry, but putting scare quotes around
Laurence Tribe's 'liberality' isn't going to make
Laurence Tribe any less 'liberal.'  Wait till
somebody nominates Tribe for the Supreme Court;
then you'll find out how 'liberal' he is.)))</span></P>

<P>"But GE is perhaps best known for the Hudson River.
<span class="bluetext">(((I suspect they're actually best known for
lightbulbs.)))</span></P>

<P>"From the late 1940s until 1977, GE discharged more
than one million pounds of the toxic waste known as
PCBs into the Hudson River. Over the years, these
chemicals have spread, contaminating two hundred
miles of river from the Hudson Falls to just shy of
the Statue of Liberty.  <span class="bluetext">(((She's French, you know.
She's a tough French harbor chick.)))</span></P>

<P>"Then-EPA Administrator Christie Whitman ordered the
company in 2002 to clean up the toxic mess. The
cleanup has yet to begin. GE has dozens of other
Superfund sites, and has lobbied for years to try
to change the Superfund law.  <span class="bluetext">(((Christie Whitman
good, Whitman's boss Bush bad.)))</span></P>

<P>"And GE is continuing its efforts to stall the cleanup.
In its federal lobbyist disclosure forms, GE notes
that one of its lobbying goals is to 'support
reasonable phasing and performance standards for the
PCB Hudson River site remedy.'  <span class="bluetext">(((Most people's
lobbyists firmly support "unreasonable phasing"
and "no performance standards" when it comes to pleasing federal regulatory bureaucracies.)))</span>

"That was translated behind closed doors this week
into a budget rider &ndash; attached to appropriations
legislation in the House Appropriations Committee &ndash;
that would call for a yearlong National Academy of
Sciences study to take another look at the project.
<span class="bluetext">(((There is, in point of fact, some small chance that GE would actually CONSIDER evidence from
the National Academy of Science, unlike, say,
both houses of the Republican Congress.)))</span></P>

<P>"Congressional sources said GE was behind the rider,
which wasn't disclosed until after committee members
voted to approve the legislation, and that it was
inserted secretly at the request of Rep. Charles
Taylor, R-N.C., who chairs the appropriations
subcommittee that oversees the issue.</P>

<P>"General Electric now has now separately confirmed?
its role in pushing the rider. GE gave Taylor $8,250
in campaign contributions during the 2004 election
cycle, according to Federal Election Commission
records.
<span class="bluetext">(((It's incredible what bargains there are in
Washington!  Eight grand? Wow!)))</span></P>

<P>"So while GE's 'coal miner' actors preen on television,
its lobbyists argue privately for a federal handout
and the Hudson remains toxic.</P>

<P>"That's greenwashing, not ecomagination."</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Okay, it's true that the Hudson is toxic with PCBs.
Scarily toxic.)))</span>

to death.  PCBs were a public-spirited
safety measure intended  to make transformers
safer.  They also turned out to be bioaccumulative
toxins, but, well, those chemicals are not gonna go
away even if GE follows Enron to the grave.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((I'm all for corporate responsibility, but
GE are not the world's only entities eager
to shirk the unforeseen consequences of
technology biting back.  Thirty years ago,
I smoked cigarettes.  I was exporting airborne
carcinogens to all and sundry, and I admit
that, but that doesn't make me eager to
get sued by Christie Whitman.
Cigarettes looked legal enough at the
time; one would like to think that the
crux of that issue is to reward people
who can come to their senses, not to single
out smokers from now till the end of time
as a matter of public principle.)))</span></P>


<P><span class="bluetext">(((Here's a different take on the matter,
from someone who was actually behind the
closed doors with the GE eco-apparat.)))</span></P>

<h2>Strategic Thinking</h2>
<p>by Joel Makower<br>
May 2005</p>

<P>"'Ecomagination': Inside GE's Power Play</P>

<P>"General Electric, the 125-year-old behemoth born out
of Thomas Edison's electric light company, is casting
a bright light on sustainability. Its chairman and CEO,
Jeffrey Immelt, has just announced that the $150
billion company is hitching its future to the growth
of clean energy, clean water, and other clean
technologies through a commitment to what GE is
calling 'ecomagination.'</P>

<P>"Ecomagination, says Immelt, aims to 'focus our unique
energy, technology, manufacturing, and infrastructure
capabilities to develop tomorrow's solutions such as
solar energy, hybrid locomotives, fuel cells,
lower-emission aircraft engines, lighter and stronger
materials, efficient lighting, and water purification
technology.'</P>

<P>"By almost any measure, it's a bold move. For GE,
the fifth-largest U.S. company, it represents a
strategic shift that could catalyze competition
among some of the world's largest companies to
accelerate the emerging clean-tech economy.</P>

<P>"Working with my colleagues at GreenOrder, a
New York-based consultancy specializing in
sustainable business, I have helped GE prepare
for this day over the past year or so, working
at both the strategic and ground levels. Having
had a front-row seat, I've watched 'ecomagination'
catch fire <span class="bluetext">(((hmmm)))</span> at GE. I thought I'd share
what I learned.</P>

<P>"First, some background. In announcing ecomagination,
GE is committing itself to:</P>

<P>"more than double its research investment in cleaner
technologies, from $700 million in 2004 to $1.5
billion in 2010;</P>

<P>"introduce more clean-tech products annually,
doubling its current $10 billion in annual revenues
from ecomagination products and services to at
least $20 billion by 2010, 'with more aggressive
targets thereafter.'</P>

<P>"GE also is pledging to improve its own environmental
performance by:</P>

<P>"reducing its greenhouse gas emissions 1% by 2012
and the intensity of its greenhouse gas emissions
30% by 2008, both compared to 2004 (based on the
company's projected growth, GE says its emissions would have otherwise risen 40% by 2012 without
further action); "reporting publicly on its progress in meeting
these goals."</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((These are pretty good goals.  If every outfit in the
FORTUNE 500 did this, we'd be living in a vastly
improved world.)))</span></P>

<P>"What's driving GE to do this? First and foremost,
it's a huge business opportunity. Clean Edge recently estimated that global markets for just
three technologies &ndash; wind power, solar photovoltaics,
and fuel cells &ndash; will grow to more than $100 billion
within 10 years, from about $16 billion today.
That doesn't include clean-water technologies, in
which GE has invested heavily. (A study last year
predicted that the market for world water treatment
technologies will reach $35 billion by 2007.)
And it doesn't include energy efficiency &ndash;
technologies that significantly reduce energy
use &ndash; which is, arguably, the biggest market of all.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((It's going to require large enterprises to
supply the skill and capital for an industrial
transformation of this scale.  Bake sales
and T-shirts won't cut it.  If you don't
think that America's fifth largest corporation
should be doing this work, whom do you expect to do
it?  Hint: it's not going to get accomplished by eco
pressure groups, global NGOs, or  off-the-grid rural
communards.)))</span></P>

<P>"Beyond that, Immelt believes the private sector
needs to step up to the plate in addressing
environmental challenges, and to stop viewing
the environment as a no-win business proposition.
Immelt doesn't advocate abandoning government action
on the environment, but he sees an alternative
pathway for business, one in which the private
sector embraces today's realities of environmental,
national security, and other concerns and invests
in creating new markets for cleaner fuels and
technologies.</P>

<P>"True, GE still manufactures nuclear power plants (which are not part of its ecomagination goals)
and is investing heavily in 'cleaner coal' technologies
(which are part of the goals) &ndash; not everyone's
definition of clean technology, though Immelt firmly
believes they should be part of our energy future.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Coal isn't going to evaporate, and, grim as
that choice is, it makes a lot more sense to glow
in the dark and risk death of thyroid cancer
than it does to melt both icecaps in our lifetime.)))</span><br>
Link:
<br><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/national/15nuke.html?hp&ex=1116216000&en=6adf4f1116cd3518&ei=5094&partner=homepage">http://www.nytimes.com/2005/05/15/national/15nuke.html?hp&amp;ex=1116216000&amp;en=6adf4f1116cd3518&amp;ei=5094&amp;partner=homepage</A><br>
"The addition to the McCain-Lieberman bill, which is
being circulated in draft form, would codify a new
political bargain. Conservatives would support
emission controls in return for liberal support for
a new generation of nuclear power plants, a shift
that could reshape the existing alignments on these
issues."
<span class="bluetext">(((Watch that space.  If it doesn't happen now,
it'll merely happen ten years from now when the
carbon heat is ten years worse.)))</span></P>

<P>"Reasonable people can disagree on this, but it's
hard to argue with Immelt's willingness to put his
company out front of the debate in a very visible
way. GE's goal is not to promote one or two energy
technologies above the others, but to push them all
aggressively. Washington could learn a lot from that
strategy.
<span class="bluetext">(((At least Washington doesn't yet dare to call for
Immelt's head on a platter.  If he gets anywhere
with solar and wind, expect instant organized calumny
from ExxonMobil's sock puppets.)))</span></P>

<P>"GE seems to be doing several other things right in
making ecomagination central to its strategy. In many
ways, it represents a textbook approach to what a
major corporate sustainability effort can look like.
Here are six specific reasons I believe GE is headed
in the right direction:</P>

<P>"1. It's being viewed as a business opportunity.
Few other large companies &ndash; BP, Dupont, and
Interface are rare exceptions &ndash; have set their
sights on making sustainability a cornerstone of
topline business growth &ndash; new products, larger
markets, stronger customer ties, etc. GE sees ecomaginationas an engine for creating new sources
of business value for years to come. That's likely
to make it sustainable within the company, and not
just the flavor of the month.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((It can't be flavor of the month because the
flavor of burning rain forests is here to stay.)))</span></P>

<P>"2. It's got solid top-level commitment. Experts
always talk about the importance of having CEO
buy-in to make sustainability more than just a
nice-to-do company initiative. (Again, BP's John
Browne, Dupont's Chad Holliday, and Interface's
Ray Anderson are among a handful of exemplars.)
Immelt seems to be making ecomagination a personal
quest, from his high-profile announcements this
week all the way to his personal appearance on
the ecomagination Web site. I'm guessing you'll
be hearing Immelt preach the ecomagination gospel
for the foreseeable future.</P>

<P>"3. It's both aspirational and specific. GE's
ecomagination pledge marries high-level strategy
and vision with specific targets and timetables.
Both are critical for sustainability to succeed
inside a company, and having one without the other
is a recipe for failure. In providing both, GE has
signaled its intention to be an environmental and
clean-tech leader, and has provided a road map of
how they plan to get there.</P>

<P>"4.  They've done their homework. GE has identified
17 products representing about $10 billion in annual
sales as part of the ecomagination platform on which
it plans to build. In doing so, the company undertook
an intensive process to identify and qualify current
ecomagination products, analyzing the environmental
attributes of GE products relative to benchmarks such
as competitors' best products, the installed base of
products, regulatory standards, and historical
performance. (Doing this analysis was one of the
key roles played by GreenOrder.) For each
ecomagination product, GE created an extensive
'scorecard' quantifying the product's environmental
attributes, impacts, and benefits relative to
comparable products. The scorecards were used to
create the product claims that can be found in
GE's printed materials, ads, and Web site.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((If the environmental movement were capable of
behavior half this businesslike, they'd be
running the parties in power in most of the
developed world.)))</span></P>

<P>"5. It's being integrated with the brand. GE says the ecomagination 'brand' will be integrated into
its overall marketing &ndash; at least for the products
that qualify. This is no small matter. Most companies
have been reluctant to play up their products'
environmental benefits (if you don't count those
feel-good image ads that come primarily from energy, chemical, and forestry companies), fearing
that their green claims won't stand up to scrutiny
when weighed against the company's overall environmental footprint. GE's leaders seem willing
to take the risk &ndash; largely because they're making
specific claims and are willing to back them up.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Their big risk may be that the eco-coffeecup
crowd may hate GE worse for succeeding in
green commercialism than they hate them for
being exemplars of capitalist evil.  BP and Shell,
the greenest and sweetest-tempered of oil majors,
always catch the "scrutiny" worse than, say,
Chevron and Texaco, who are twice as evil but cannily keep a lower profile.)))</span></p>

<p>"6. They're in it for the long haul. Clearly,
ecomagination &ndash; like sustainability itself &ndash; is
not a one-off campaign or short-term proposition.
GE seems determined to make ecomagination part of
its identity. It plans not just to market the brand
aggressively to the world, but also internally, to GE's 300,000-employee base, to ensure that the
notion of leadership through clean technology is
part of everyone's job.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((If everyone in GE is a corporate criminal,
you're advocating the liquidation of 300,000 people.)))</span>

"Time will tell, of course, how effective this
strategy will be in helping GE gain business &ndash;
and shareholder &ndash; value. If it works, it may provide
a model for how a company can strike out as an
environmental leader in today's cynical marketplace."</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Well, I wasn't in the room when GE was
brainstorming its green corporate remake,
but let me put it this way.  We've got a
choice here between transforming a deadly behemoth
whose behavior means woe for our children,
or nursing weird psychosexual grudges about
the Statue of Liberty and irradiated
nuclear testicles from 1963.  I don't say
we should forget the past, but I do say we should
get the hell on with the work at hand.)))</span></P>
