<h3>"Air Pollution and Heritable Mutations</h3>

<P>"Air pollution from vehicles, industry, and power
stations can have adverse affects on the environment
and public health. Now a report in the 14 May 2004
Science indicates that airborne contaminants cause
damage that can be passed on to future generations. Somers et al. <a href="http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/304/5673/1008">http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/short/304/5673/1008</A>
<font color="blue">(((Real scientists won't let you read this unless
you pay somebody-or-other.)))
showed that offspring of mice exposed to steel mill
and highway air pollution for ten weeks inherited mutations
in a marker gene twice as frequently as offspring of mice
in a rural environment. Furthermore, the researchers
demonstrated that filtering the polluted air through
high-efficiency particulate-air (HEPA) filters &ndash;
which remove more than 99.9% of particles 0.3
micrometers in diameter &ndash; reduced the mutation
rate by about 50%. This suggests that the culprit
mutagens are inhaled particles or particle-bound
contaminants such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons."</P>

<P>"Enron Traders Caught On Tape<br>

"LOS ANGELES, June 1, 2004<br>

"Enron Scammers On Tape<p>

<h3>ENRON'S INTERNAL MEMOS</h3>

<P>"The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission released
two Enron memos describing company plans to inflate
energy prices during California's energy crisis of
2000.</P>

<P>"The practices were considered so outrageous, that
an attorney with the California Public Utilities
Commission dubbed them a 'smoking gun memo.'</P>

<P>"(CBS)?When a forest fire shut down a major
transmission line into California, cutting power
supplies and raising prices, Enron energy traders
celebrated, CBS News Correspondent Vince Gonzales
reports.</P>

<P>"'Burn, baby, burn. That's a beautiful thing,'
a trader sang about the massive fire.</P>

<P>"Four years after California's disastrous experiment
with energy deregulation, Enron energy traders can be
heard &ndash; on audiotapes obtained by CBS News &ndash;
gloating and praising each other as they helped
bring on, and cash-in on, the Western power crisis.</P>

<P>"'He just f---s California,' says one Enron employee.
'He steals money from California to the tune of about
a million.'</P>

<P>"'Will you rephrase that?' asks a second employee.</P>

<P>"'OK, he, um, he arbitrages the California market to
the tune of a million bucks or two a day,' replies
the first.</P>

<P>"The tapes, from Enron's West Coast trading desk,
also confirm what CBS reported years ago: that in
secret deals with power producers, traders deliberately
drove up prices by ordering power plants shut down.</P>

<P>"'If you took down the steamer, how long would it
take to get it back up?' an Enron worker is heard
saying.</P>

<P>"'Oh, it's not something you want to just be turning
on and off every hour. Let's put it that way,'
another says.</P>

<P>"'Well, why don't you just go ahead and shut her down.'</P>

<P>"Officials with the Snohomish Public Utility District
near Seattle received the tapes from the Justice
Department.</P>

<P>"'This is the evidence we've all been waiting for.
This proves they manipulated the market,' said Eric
Christensen, a spokesman for the utility.</P>

<P>"That utility, like many others, is trying to get
its money back from Enron.</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>"'They're f------g taking all the money back from
you guys?' complains an Enron employee on the tapes.
'All the money you guys stole from those poor
grandmothers in California?'

"'Yeah, grandma Millie, man.'

"'Yeah, now she wants her f------g money back for
all the power you've charged right up, jammed right
up her a------ for f------g $250 a megawatt hour.'</P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->


<P><font color="blue">(((It's like poetry, isn't it?)))</P>

<P>"And the tapes appear to link top Enron officials
Ken Lay and Jeffrey Skilling to schemes that fueled
the crisis.</P>

<P>"'Government Affairs has to prove how valuable it
is to Ken Lay and Jeff Skilling,' says one trader.</P>

<P>"'Ok.'</P>

<P>"'Do you know when you started over-scheduling load
and making buckets of money on that?'</P>

<P>"Before the 2000 election, Enron employees pondered
the possibilities of a Bush win.</P>

<P>"'It'd be great. I'd love to see Ken Lay Secretary
of Energy,' says one Enron worker.</P>

<P>"That didn't happen, but they were sure President
Bush would fight any limits on sky-high energy prices.</P>

<P>"'When this election comes Bush will f------g whack
this s--t, man. He won't play this price-cap b------t.'</P>

<P>"Crude, but true.</P>

<P>"'We will not take any action that makes California's
problems worse and that's why I oppose price caps,'
said Mr. Bush on May 29, 2001.</P>

<P>"Both the Justice Department and Enron tried to
prevent the release of these tapes. Enron's
lawyers argued they merely prove 'that people at
Enron sometimes talked like Barnacle Bill the Sailor.'
<font color="blue">(((Yeah, if Bill was a pirate pulling down a million a day
in market manipulation while laughing at widows.)))</P>
