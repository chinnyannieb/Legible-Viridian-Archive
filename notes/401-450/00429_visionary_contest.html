<H2>Viridian Note 00429: Visionary Contest</H2>


<DL><dt>Key concepts:</dt> <dd>
 design, visionaries, T-shirts, Viridian contests
</dd>

<dt>Attention Conservation Notice:</dt>  <dd>There's been very little Viridian traffic lately.  That 
will change soon.
This is an excellent opportunity to resign from the list if email has you overwhelmed.  
Also, there is a new Viridian Design Contest afoot with a particularly attractive 
prize.</dd></DL>

<HR NOSHADE ALIGN="LEFT" WIDTH="488">

<P>As attentive Viridian readers know, I am currently a design teacher in Pasadena, 
California.  My official title at Art Center College of Design is "Visionary in 
Residence."</P>

<P>Link:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.artcenter.edu">http://www.artcenter.edu</A></P>


<P>Art Center has never had anyone "in residence,"
much less a "visionary."  That means it's up to me to set the tone for all future 
visionaries who may grace the confines of this patch of academe.</P>

<P>Clearly, Job One (now that I've met my colleagues and students) is the creation of an 
official Art Center <strong>VISIONARY IN RESIDENCE T-shirt</strong>.</P>

<P>Some day all this will  be behind me (we futurists do like to think that way), and then 
I will need to boast:
"Been there, done that &ndash; got the T-shirt."
But where in fact do I get this garment?  From YOU!</P>

<P>Here is an unaltered Art Center souvenir T-shirt, sold from the local, on-campus arts 
supply store:
<A HREF="../../shirt.html">http://www.viridiandesign.org/shirt.html</A></P>

<P>We Viridians clearly need to jazz this up considerably.
Mind you, this is a multi-purpose design.  Henceforth, everybody on Viridian List needs to 
consider themselves a "Visionary in Residence,"  wherever you may be.</P>


<P>Why?  Well, fellow Visionaries,  I want you to have a long, crystal ball-busting look 
at the New Official Greenhouse Global Future here, this G-8 mandated,  scientist-vetted, 
Tony-Blair approved  Spectre of Planetary Doom:</P>

"Global warming: scientists reveal timetable By Michael McCarthy, Environment 
Correspondent</P>

<P>"03 February 2005</P>

<P>"A detailed timetable of the destruction and distress that global warming is likely to 
cause the world was unveiled yesterday.</P>

<P>"It pulls together for the first time the projected impacts on ecosystems  and wildlife,
 food production, water resources and economies across the earth, for given rises in 
global temperature expected during the next hundred years.</P>


<P>"The resultant picture gives the most wide-ranging impression yet of the bewildering 
array of destructive effects that climate change is expected to exert on different regions,
 from the  mountains of Europe and the rainforests of the Amazon  to the coral reefs  of 
the tropics.</P>

<P>"Produced through a synthesis of a wide range of recent academic studies, it was 
presented as a paper yesterday to the international conference on climate change being 
held at the UK Met Office headquarters in Exeter by the author Bill Hare, of the Potsdam 
Institute for Climate  Impact Research, Germany's leading global warming research 
institute.</P>

<P>The Euro Great and The Good cluster in growing dread:
<A HREF="http://www.european-climate-forum.net/membership/membership.html">http://www.european-climate-forum.net/membership/membership.html</A></P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"The conference has been called personally by Tony Blair as part of Britain's 
  attempts to move the climate change issue  up the agenda during the current UK presidency 
  of the G8 group of rich nations, and the European Union. It has  already heard disturbing 
  warnings from the latest climate research, including the revelation on Tuesday from the 
  British Antarctic Survey that the massive West Antarctic  ice sheet might be 
  disintegrating &ndash; an event which, if it  happened completely, would raise sea levels 
  around the  world by 16ft (4.9 metres).</BLOCKQUOTE>

So long, Florida:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.stabilisation2005.com/programme.html">http://www.stabilisation2005.com/programme.html</A></P>

<P>"Dr Hare's timetable shows the impacts of climate change multiplying rapidly as average 
global temperature goes up, towards 1C above levels before the industrial revolution,  
then to 2C, and then 3C.</P>

<P>"As present world temperatures are already 0.7C above the pre-industrial level, the 
process is well under way.</P>

"In the near future &ndash; the next 25 years &ndash; as the temperature climbs to the 
  1C mark, some specialised ecosystems will start to feel stress, such as the tropical 
  highland forests of Queensland, which contain a large number of Australia's endemic plant 
  species, and the succulent karoo plant region of South Africa. In some developing 
  countries, food production will start to decline, water shortage problems will worsen and 
  there will be net losses in GDP.
  <span class="bluetext">(((May I translate that into actual speech? "Starvation, grinding poverty and large, 
  deserted  cities.")))</span>
<BLOCKQUOTE>"It is when the temperature moves up to 2C above the pre-industrial level, expected 
  in the middle of this century &ndash; within the lifetime of many people alive today &ndash; that 
  serious effects start to come thick and fast, studies suggest.</P>

  <P>"Substantial losses of Arctic sea ice will threaten species such as polar bears and 
  walruses, while in tropical regions 'bleaching' of coral reefs will become more frequent 
  &ndash; when the animals that live in the coral are forced out by high temperatures and the 
  reef may die. Mediterranean regions will be hit by more forest fires and insect pests, 
  while in regions of the US such as the Rockies, rivers may become too warm for trout and 
  salmon.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>"In South Africa, the Fynbos, the world's most remarkable floral kingdom which has more 
than 8,000 endemic wild flowers, will start to lose its species, as will alpine areas from 
Europe to Australia; the broad-leaved forests of China will start to die.
The numbers at risk from hunger will increase and another billion and a half people will 
face water shortages, and GDP losses in some developing countries will become 
significant.</P>

<P>"But when the temperature moves up to the 3C level, expected in the early part of the 
second half of the century, these effects will become critical.
There is likely to be irreversible damage to the Amazon rainforest, leading to its 
collapse, and the complete destruction of coral reefs is likely to be widespread.</P>

<P>"The alpine flora of Europe, Australia and New Zealand will probably disappear 
completely, with increasing numbers of extinctions of other plant species. There will be 
severe  losses of China's broadleaved forests, and in South  Africa the flora of the 
Succulent Karoo will be destroyed, and the flora of the Fynbos will be hugely damaged.
</P>

<P>"There will be a rapid increase in populations exposed to hunger, with up to 5.5 
billion people living in regions with large losses in crop production, while another 3 
billion people will have increased risk of water shortages.</P>

<P>"Above the 3C raised level, which may be after 2070, the effects will be catastrophic: 
the Arctic sea ice will disappear, and species such as polar bears and walruses may 
disappear with it, while the main prey species of Arctic carnivores, such as wolves, 
Arctic foxes and the collared lemming, will have gone from 80 per cent of their range, 
critically endangering predators.</P>

<P>"In human terms there is likely to be catastrophe too, with water stress becoming even 
worse, and whole regions becoming unsuitable for producing food, while there will be 
substantial impacts on global GDP."</P>

<P>
This is a rather antiseptic, policy wonk's description of complete Jared Diamond-style 
mayhem, the portrait of a 21st century planet bleeding to death from self-slit wrists.<br>

<P>But that is NOT the dark, compelling, necrotic Vision that I want you to address in 
this T-shirt contest.  No, I need a T-shirt entirely suitable for someone who can grasp 
that crisis, that Dirty Little Sister of Nuclear Armageddon, in its full, factual enormity,
 and enVisionarize a future world in which that fate is averted, transcended, beaten back 
and comprehensively repelled, a world in which the Smoke Ghost has been jammed back into 
its fossilized crypt, and the menace of the Greenhouse is as much a period artifact as the 
menace of the Arms Race.</P>


<P>Envisioning mayhem is not much of a challenge for us pros.
Though some fools and naifs may remain ignorant of the causes of their growing distress, 
everybody will have to deal with that dark vision becoming reality, because we'll be left 
with no choice.
Envisioning a way up and out of that, now that's the true challenge to the contemporary 
imagination.</P>

<P>I need that shirt, ladies and gentlemen.</P>

<P>Your reward?  YOUR OWN NAME, deftly and cybernetically CRYSTALIZED into a fantastic, 
laser-etched, cosmically visionary miniature monument!!</P>
