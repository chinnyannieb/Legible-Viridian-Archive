<h3>Rowan Williams: A planet on the brink</h3>

<P>"The Archbishop of Canterbury warns that the price
of our continued failure to protect the earth will
be violence and social collapse <span class="bluetext">(((well, yes,
that's what the man says)))</span></P>

<P>"17 April 2005 "Too often in recent decades, the two big 'e' words == 
ecology and economy ==  have been used as though they 
represented opposing concerns. Yes, we should be glad 
to do more about the environment, if only this didn't 
interfere with economic development and with the liberty of people and nations to create wealth in
whatever ways they can.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Odd that the Archbishop doesn't mention the
world's favorite big e-word, "electronic." As in
e-commerce, e-tcetera.)))</span></P>

<P>"Or, we should be glad to address environmental issues
if we could be sure that we had first resolved the
challenge of economic injustice within and between
societies. So from both left and right there has often
been a persistent sense that it isn't proper or
possible to tackle both together, let alone to give
a different sort of priority to ecological matters.</P>

<P>"But this separation or opposition has come to look
like a massive mistake.  <span class="bluetext">(((Yes.)))</span>  It has been said
that 'the economy is a wholly owned subsidiary of
the environment'. The earth itself is what ultimately
controls economic activity because it is the source
of the materials upon which economic activity works."</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Not that I cavil at this wise assessment,
but check this weirdness out: <STRONG>lunar power.</STRONG>
Solar lunar power.  Made with robots on the Moon
smelting Moon dust.  What a truly loony scheme!
This makes even transubstantiation and the Holy
Trinity seem plausible!)))</span></P>

<P>"That is why economy and ecology cannot be separated.
Ecological fallout from economic development is in no
way an 'externality' as the economic jargon has it;
it is a positive depletion of real wealth, of human
and natural capital. To seek to have economy without ecology is to try to manage an environment with no 
knowledge or concern about how it works in itself == 
to try to formulate human laws in abstraction from 
or ignorance of the laws of nature."</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">((("Laws of nature?"  Sure!  It's okay to mention
evolution aloud:  this is the Archbishop of Canterbury
here.)))</span></P>

<P>"It is time to look seriously at the full implications
of this.  <span class="bluetext">(((Welcome to the club, Your Grace!)))</span> We
need to start by recognising that social collapse is
a real possibility. When we speak about environmental
crisis, we are not to think only of spiralling
poverty and mortality, but about brutal and
uncontainable conflict. An economics that ignores environmental degradation invites social 
degradation == in plain terms, violence.</P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
 

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Social collapse is a present reality,
if not in Canterbury. Look at the scale of
the spiralling mayhem in this map!  And you bet that
means violence.  "Military engagement....
is not only necessary and inevitable, but good.")))</span>

<br><a href="http://www.thomaspmbarnett.com/published/pentagonsnewmap.htm">http://www.thomaspmbarnett.com/published/pentagonsnewmap.htm</A></P>

<P>"It is no news that access to water is likely to be
a major cause of serious conflict in the century
just beginning. But this is only one aspect of a
steadily darkening situation. Needless to say, it
will be the poorest countries that suffer first
and most dramatically, but the 'developed' world
will not be able to escape: the failure to manage
the resources we have, has the same consequences
wherever we are. In the interim, we can imagine
'fortress' strategies (with increasing levels of
social control demanded) struggling to keep the
growing instability and violence elsewhere at bay
and so intensifying its energy."
<span class="bluetext">(((His Grace talks rather like Barnett, when you come
to think of it.)))</span></P>

<P>"And we are not talking about a remote future.
<span class="bluetext">(((This is a clear invitation to science fiction
writers to move on to an issue that's a little
remoter.  Either that, or else I need to take holy
orders.)))</span> There are arguments over the exact rates
of global warming, certainly, and we cannot easily
predict the full effects of some modifications in
species balance. But we should not imagine that
uncertainty in this or that particular seriously
modifies the overall picture. On any account, we
are failing.</P>

<P>"It is relatively easy to sketch the gravity of
our situation; not too difficult either to say
that governments should be doing more. But
governments depend on electorates; electors are
persons like us who need motivating. Unless there
is real popular motivation, governments are much
less likely to act or act effectively. There are
always quite a few excuses around for not taking
action, and, without a genuine popular mandate
for change, we cannot be surprised or outraged
if courage fails and progress is minimal.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((His Grace is right!  We're all sinners!
We're bringin' it on ourselves!)))</span></P>

<P>"Our own responsibility is to help change that
popular motivation and so to give courage to
political leaders. And this means challenging
and changing some of the governing assumptions
about ourselves as human beings.  <span class="bluetext">(((For instance,
if 90 percent of human beings died in a
full-scale global collapse into a welter of
violence, the environment would perk up
considerably!)))</span></P>

<P>"One of the reasons sometimes given for not being
too alarmed by predictions of ecological disaster
is that we are underrating the possibilities that
will be offered by new technologies. But to appeal
to a technical future is to say that our most
fundamental right as humans is unrestricted consumer
choice. <span class="bluetext">(((!)))</span> In order to defend that, we must
mobilise all our resources of skill and ingenuity,
diverting resources from other areas so that we can
solve problems created by our own addictive behaviours.
The question is whether, even if this were clearly
possible, it would be a sane or desirable way of
envisaging the human future.  <span class="bluetext">(((We've come a long
way when our religious leaders consider technology
a synonym for consumerism.  "Technology" used to
be about racing to the Moon and blowing up
Communists.)))</span></P>

<P>"All the great religious traditions, in their several
ways, <span class="bluetext">(((you have to like this ecumenicalism in an
era of suicide carbombers)))</span> insist that personal
wealth is not to be seen in terms of reducing the
world to what the individual can control and manipulate
for whatever exclusively human purposes may be most
pressing. Religious belief claims, in the first place,
that I am most fully myself only in relation with my
creator; what I am in virtue of this relationship
cannot be diminished or modified by any earthly power.
In the environment there is a dimension that resists
and escapes us: to reduce the world to a storehouse of
materials for limited human purposes is thus to put in
question any serious belief in an indestructible human value.  <span class="bluetext">(((Okay, suppose the world stopped being so 
fat, sloppy and materialistic == let's say we're 
reduced to a post-Greenhouse cataclysmic desert. 
Would our indestructible human values thrive?  Maybe 
they would!  Great religions arise in deserts.)))</span></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
 

<P>"We have to return constantly to what sort of
structures and sanctions might assist in making
effective a change in our motivations and myths. We could imagine, for instance, a 'charter' of 
rights in relation to the environment == that we 
should be able to live in a world that still 
had wilderness spaces, that still nurtured a 
balanced variety of species, that allowed us access 
to unpoisoned natural foodstuffs. It may be that 
the time is ripe for an attempt at a comprehensive 
statement of this, a new UN commitment == a 
'Charter of Rights to Natural Capital' to which 
governments could sign up and by which their 
own practice and that of the nations in whose 
economies they invested could be measured.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Sooner or later, since the Greenhouse is a
universal problem, everybody is going to find
a solution in their own preconceptions.
If you're an Archbishop, it's about spirituality.
If you're a plumber,  all about dam-building. If you're a tailor, it's about raincoats;
if you're a barber, it's about ruined hairdos.)))</span></p>

<P>"A manageable first step relating particularly
to carbon emissions, supported by a wide coalition
of concerned parties, is of course the 'contraction
and convergence' proposals initially developed by
the Global Commons Institute in London. This
involves granting to each nation a notional
'entitlement to pollute' up to an agreed level that
is credibly compatible with overall goals for
managing and limiting atmospheric pollution. Those
nations which exceed this level would have to pay
pro rata charges on their excess emissions. The money thus raised would be put at the service of 
low-emission nations == or could presumably be 
ploughed back into poor but high-emission 
nations == who would be, so to speak, in credit 
as to their entitlements, so as to assist them 
in ecologically sustainable development. <span class="bluetext">(((Look at that!  His Grace is a real global
climate wonk! He's not merely dabbling in the
issue, he's been hitting the books here.)))</span></P>

<P>"Election campaigns seldom give much space to
environmental matters; governments need strengthening
in their commitments and need electoral incentives
to be involved in the sort of internationally
agreed aspirations But it is because the ecological
agenda is always going to be vulnerable to the
pressure of other more apparently 'immediate'
issues that it cannot be left to electoral politics
alone. We still need a steady background of
awareness and small-scale committed action,
nourished by some kind of coherent vision.
<span class="bluetext">(((I'd happily sacrifice the "awareness" for
some committed action.  If we had effective
action we wouldn't NEED "awareness.")))</span></P>

<P>"Ecologists have argued regularly that some
religious attitudes are part of the problem;
once again we have to ask whether religion is
part of the solution. Religious faith should
steer us away from any fantasies we may have
of not 'interfering' with the environment (the
first planting of grain was an interference),
but it tells us that our interaction with what
lies around can never be simply functional and
problem-solving.</P>

<P>"Religious commitment becomes in this context a
crucial element in that renewal of our motivation
for living realistically in our material setting.
The loss of a sustainable environment protected from unlimited exploitation is the loss of a 
sustainable humanity in every sense == not only 
the loss of a spiritual depth but ultimately the 
loss of simple material stability as well. It is 
up to us as consumers and voters to do better 
justice to the 'house' we have been invited to keep, the world where we are guests."</P>
