<P>"Decision Brief<BR>
07 March 2005<BR>
No. 05-D 11  <span class="bluetext">(((what the heck kinda<BR>
numbering system is that?  This is partisan
email, not a Pentagon parts requisition!)))</span></P>


<P>"Set America Free</P>

<P>"(Washington, D.C.): Saudi Arabia's oil minister,
Ali al-Nuaimi, recently announced that he expected
the price of oil to remain at unconscionably high
levels of between $40 and $50 per barrel through
2005. Ironically, every American should be grateful.
<span class="bluetext">(((I know I am!)))</span></P>

<P>"Friends Like These</P>

<P>"Such gratitude is not, of course, due the Saudis ==
who, we are endlessly told, are among our most
reliable 'friends' in the Middle East == because
they are working to drive down the price of oil
set by the OPEC racketeers' cartel. To the
contrary, the Saudis appear content to keep
prices exorbitantly high, even though they are
well aware of the adverse impact such artificially
inflated costs have on the financial well-being of
their principal protector, the United States.</P>

<P>"Rather, we should be appreciative for what should
be the proverbial camel's back-breaking straw: A
final wake-up call, one that establishes unmistakably
that it is neither in the United States' strategic
national security nor economic interests for this
country and other industrialized nations to
continue relying upon imported oil from those who
wish to do us harm.  <span class="bluetext">(((Okay, wait, it's about
to get better.)))</span></P>

<P>"Fortunately, as columnist Fareed Zakaria noted in
the March 7 edition of Newsweek, we can respond
immediately to this call: 'Tomorrow, President
Bush could make the following speech:'...It is now
possible to build cars that are powered by a
combination of electricity and alcohol-based fuels,
with petroleum as only one element among many. My
administration is going to put in place a series of
policies that will ensure that in four years, the
average new American car will get 300 miles per
gallon of petroleum. And I fully expect in this
period to see cars in the United States that get
500 miles per gallon.'" <span class="bluetext">(((500MPG?!? Yeah, that would
be par for the Bush course all right == faith-based
internal combustion engines.)))</span></P>

<P>"A World Transformed"  <span class="bluetext">(((We're bound to get that
no matter what; the question is how many of us
survive to see that world and how much of it is
on fire.)))</span></P>

<P>"Needless to say, the widespread availability of
such cars == and the alternative fuels they would
utilize == would literally change the world.
<span class="bluetext">(((Yeah, this calls for visionary daring...
maybe they're powered by flying pigs strapped
into treadmills!)))</span></P>

<P>"Our enemies would be denied the geo-strategic
leverage they currently enjoy, as indigenously
produced energy sources derived from coal,
<span class="bluetext">(((oh boy)))</span> biomass <span class="bluetext">(((woah)))</span>) and garbage
<span class="bluetext">(((yahoo!)))</span> knock the pegs out from under the
cartel's control of the commodity upon which
our transportation sector heavily depends.
<span class="bluetext">(((And that commodity is bayonets!  Oh wait,
that would be the unilateral <STRONG>military</STRONG> cartel.)))</span></P>


<P>"In particular, we would no longer have to export
tens of billions in petrodollars  <span class="bluetext">(((yay!)))</span>
that are used, in part, to promote the
Islamofascist ideology  <span class="bluetext">(((well, yes)))</span> that
animates many of those determined to kill us.
<span class="bluetext">(((You know what?  Venezuelans have oil and
they don't like us either!)))</span> (The Saudi
government’&Auml;&ocirc;s hand in proselytizing along
precisely those lines was clearly demonstrated
in a study, released last month by Freedom House,
<span class="bluetext">(((cranks)))</span>) of hate-mongering materials
officially produced and distributed in this
country by the Kingdom.)  <span class="bluetext">(((This is what really
bugs the Center for Security Policy == the idea
that Wahhabis dare to enter the game of
distributing wacky pamphlets to the American
populace.)))</span></P>

<P>"We can also greatly reduce our vulnerability
to disruptions of critical energy infrastructures,
at home and abroad. Our foes have learned how
easy it is for them to cost us dearly by blowing
up a pipeline or sinking a tanker."</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Boy, I'll say.)))</span><BR>

<P>"Creating diverse alternative fuel sources here
at home is, simply put, a national security
imperative."</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Not that that would help much against domestic
terrorists who might want to try attacks on critical
American energy infrastructure.)))</span><BR>

<P>"Not least, this is true since we are likely to
find increasing competition from China for limited
oil will become a flash point for future conflict,
<span class="bluetext">(((Okay, so who's the heavy here == the Saudis
hoarding cartel oil, or the Chinese buying it?)))</span>
"if not an actual casus belli. Already, the PRC
is frantically making strategic alliances with
oil-exporting terrorist-sponsoring states like Iran,
Sudan and Venezuela.  <span class="bluetext">(((The Venezuelan Moslem
menace finally rears its head... how 'bout
Nigeria?)))</span> It is also moving to buy up Canadian,
Brazilian and Indonesian energy sources, <span class="bluetext">((((more
enemies of the state, especially those sinister
Canadians)))</span>) transparently with a  view to
denying them to us as well as meeting<BR>
their own burgeoning demands.  <span class="bluetext">(((Is there
ANYONE left in the WHOLE WORLD who isn't
cheating and harming Republicans?)))</span></P>

<P>"Setting America Free</P>

<P>"As Zakaria reports, there is now a blueprint
for energy security (<A HREF="http://www.SetAmericaFree.org/">www.SetAmericaFree.org</A>) that
can translate available technologies into widely
available fuel and automotive products and catalyze
the sorts of outcomes described above.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((You gotta see this:  look at this weird crowd of
Iran-Contra vets, spooks, and rightwing
thinktankologists.  It's like a version of
WINNING THE OIL END GAME through Alice's
looking glass.)))</span><BR>
Link:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.setamericafree.org/who.htm">http://www.setamericafree.org/who.htm</A><BR>
<span class="bluetext">(((The Set America Free Coalition; yeah, you
bet I jumped right on that mailing list.)))</span></P>

<P>"Specifically, this blueprint envisions a new
Manhattan Project on energy independence
<span class="bluetext">(((wait a minute, we already had one of those
and it blew up two Japanese cities)))</span><BR>
that will, for an investment by the federal government
of $12 billion over the next four years, translate
into a reduction of at least 50% in projected oil
imports in 2025.</P>

<P>"This blueprint envisions allocating such
expenditures in the following, practical ways:</P>


<P>"$2 billion for automotive manufacturers to cover
one-half the costs of building flexible fuel
vehicle-capability [that is, autos that can use
ethanol or methanol based fuels] into their
new production cars (i.e., roughly 40 million
cars at $50 per unit);  <span class="bluetext">(((are you listening,
Amory "Hypercar" Lovins?)))</span></P>

<P>"$1 billion to pay for at least one out of
every four existing gas stations to add at
least one pump to supply alcohol fuels (an
estimated incentive of $20,000 per pump,
new pumps costing approximately $60,000 per
unit); <span class="bluetext">(((that's practical thinking, all right;
just buy all the gas-pumps in America)))</span></P>

<P>"$2 billion in consumer tax incentives to
procure hybrid cars;  <span class="bluetext">(((hallelujah)))</span></P>


<P>"$2 billion for automotive manufacturers to
commercialize plug-in hybrid electric<BR>
vehicles [that is, cars that can be plugged
into the electrical grid to recharge their
batteries];  <span class="bluetext">(((pardon my astonishment)))</span></P>

<P>"$3 billion to construct commercial-scale
demonstration plants to produce non-petroleum
based liquid fuels (utilizing public-private
cost-sharing partnerships to build roughly
25 plants in order to demonstrate the feasibility
of various approaches to perform efficiently
at full-scale production);  <span class="bluetext">((('cause we need to
bribe roughly 25 porkbarreling Congressmen)))</span>
and</P>

<P>"$2 billion to continue work on commercializing
fuel cell technology."  <span class="bluetext">(((Admit it!  It's infinitely
better than the Bush energy plan!)))</span></P>


<P>"The Bottom Line</P>

<P>"In the course of the 2000 presidential campaign,
then-candidate George W. Bush declared: 'Detroit
is ready now to make cars that would run on any
combination of gasoline and alcohol == either
ethanol, made from corn or methanol, made from natural
gas or coal or even wood.  Let us turn away from
our dependence on imported oil to domestic
products == corn, natural gas, and coal == and
look for energy not just from the Middle East
but from the Middle West.'  <span class="bluetext">(((Oh yeah, man!
A coalburner in every garage!)))</span></P>

<P>"This was a sensible strategy before 9/11.
Today, it is absolutely mandatory. Like Nixon
going to China,  <span class="bluetext">(((just before dodging his
inevitable impeachment)))</span> a President from Texas
oil country is just the man to launch the
Manhattan Project that Sets America Free."</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Whaaah? What happened to Chevron, Exxon-Mobil
and Halliburton?  Wait == are they all in the
round file with Enron?  I am so with that!
Tell me more!)))</span></P>

<P><BR>
<span class="bluetext">(((And now, for those of you who managed
to wade this far through the cognitive
dissonance, a special party treat!)))</span></P>
