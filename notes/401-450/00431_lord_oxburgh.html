technologies shown in previous concept vehicles, such

the size of a Cadillac SRX, travels up to 300 miles

<P>The Sunday <em>Times</em> &ndash; Britain<br>
January 30, 2005</P>

<P>"Shell Oil Chief Defects to the Green Lobby</P>

<P>"THE outgoing chairman of Shell has announced he
wants to take up a post  with a climate-change
charity when he quits the oil giant later this year,
writes Jonathan Leake.</P>

<P>"Lord Oxburgh is so concerned at the potential
destruction from globalwarming that he wants to
devote more of his time to cutting greenhouse
gas emissions and the use of fossil fuels.</P>

<P>"The move is likely to cause some embarrassment
at Shell, one of the  biggest oil and gas producers
in the world.  <span class="bluetext">(((Why "embarrassment," for God's
sake?  They should be justly proud!)))</span></P>

<P>Despite a history of environmental controversies,
it is now seen as one  of the greenest oil companies,
but each year its worldwide activities and
products still release about 700m tons of carbon
dioxide into the atmosphere.  <span class="bluetext">(((Shell probably
IS the greenest oil major, not just "seen as
one." Yet most every time they do something sane
and praiseworthy, the British press hounds them as if
they were worse than Esso.  Would you get the scorecard
straight here, please?  EXXON-MOBIL = Fiends from Hell.
BP = Smart, With-It European Guys.  SHELL = Practically
Approaching Sainthood.  ENRON = The Eventual, Miserable
Fate of  Every One of These Godforsaken Soot-Spewing
Malefactors.)))</span></P>

<P>"By contrast, emissions from the whole of Britain
total around 560m tons  out of a total world output
of 25 billion tons.  <span class="bluetext">(((That's right, the "whole of
Britain" is 5/7th as culpable as Shell.  And by the
way, the "whole of Britain" is not regarded as one
of the greener nations.)))</span></P>

<P>"Oxburgh, who chairs Shell as a non-executive, said:
'When I leave I  would like to go onto the board of
a climate change charity. I would be campaigning for
more responsible use of hydrocarbons.'
<span class="bluetext">(((What a great idea!  The guy's  a saint!
Worldchanging should write him right away and
ask him to blog!)))</span></P>

<P>"Oxburgh, who is also chairman of the House of Lords
science and technology committee,  <span class="bluetext">(((Look!  An oilman
with an IQ!)))</span> emphasises  that the target of such
campaigns would not be so  much the oil companies as
government ministers and departments.
<span class="bluetext">(((If the shoe fits, wear it.)))</span></P>

<P>"He believes it is only through taxation, regulation
and new technology  that the world can have any hope of reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
<span class="bluetext">(((Okay, fine! That's what got us into this mess in
the first place: taxation, regulation and new
technology.)))</span></P>

<P>"However, his belief that governments should impose
higher taxes on  aviation fuels, petrol, oil, gas
and other hydrocarbons to discourage their use
may alarm other oil company executives.  <span class="bluetext">(((Not as
much as a few stiff prison sentences for crimes
against humanity would alarm them, but, well, let's
wait and see.)))</span></P>

<P>"Oxburgh, an academic geologist by training, became
chairman  unexpectedly last year after the forced
departure of Sir Philip Watts, who was  criticised
in the controversy over the overstating of Shell's
oil reserves. The  peer has now reached retirement
age and is due to leave this summer.
<span class="bluetext">(((How hard are these "forced departures"?
Especially if it dawns on shareholders that
they're paying to poison themselves and wash
their own homes away.)))</span></P>

<P>"He has faced apparent contradictions in chairing
Shell &ndash; for example, by accepting long ago
scientific arguments that the climate was being
changed by greenhouse gas emissions. This has
prompted him to abandon the  executive transport
and car park offered by Shell and adopt a folding
bicycle,  which he keeps in a cupboard in the lobby
of the Shell building on the South  Bank in London.
<span class="bluetext">(((He rides a FOLDING BIKE, for heaven's sake!)))</span></P>

The skinny on the latest in folding bikes</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">((("Do YOU ride a folding bike?  No?  Then stop
questioning his integrity!)))</span></P>

<P>"At home, Oxburgh has persuaded his wife and son to
use bicycles and  abandon the car "except for trips
to the supermarket". For those, he uses a  diesel
capable of 60 miles to the gallon.  <span class="bluetext">(((Imagine if we all did that.)))</span></P>

<P>"'Domestically we all ride bicycles and use the car
as little as we  can,' he said. The family has also
abandoned air travel for holidays  &ndash; though  Oxburgh
still regularly has to fly on business matters.
<span class="bluetext">(((I have a hard time giving up flying, though
I've been known to use the eerily abandoned Los
Angeles Metro light rail system.  It has some of
the prettiest design of any railroad I ever saw,
but Angelenos stare at it as if it were built
for  Martian tripods.)))</span></P>

<P>"His Cambridge home, insulated and double-glazed,
is now also fully  equipped with energy-saving light
bulbs. 'I have some struggles with my family;
there is a little resistance because they take a
little while to warm up,' he said.</P>

<P>"Oxburgh has also helped Shell worldwide to adopt
similar measures. The company now carries out
carbon audits, employs consultants to seek new
ways of cutting energy use and has drawn up long-term
plans to reduce  greenhouse gas emissions from its
internal activities.</P>

<P>"However, environmentalists say such measures are
trivial when Shell is continually expanding its
operations. Tony Juniper, director of Friends
of the Earth, said: ’&Auml;&uacute;Before he leaves, Lord Oxburgh
should be trying to  change Shell. The company is
pumping more oil and gas than ever before.'
<span class="bluetext">(((D'you suppose Tony's family all rides bikes?)))</span></P>

<P>Oxburgh’&Auml;&ocirc;s ambition was, however, welcomed by
Greenpeace, which has a  long history of clashes
with Shell, most famously when it successfully
campaigned against the company’&Auml;&ocirc;s attempts to dump
the disused Brent Spar oil rig  at sea in 1995.</P>

<P>"Blake Lee-Harwood, director of campaigns at
Greenpeace UK, said: 'We  would still disagree on
many issues but his expertise and experience would
make him a welcome addition to the team.'  <span class="bluetext">(((THANK
YOU for belonging to the Reality-Based Community,
Greenpeace UK! In future you won't have to worry
about Shell dumping oil rigs at sea &ndash; because the
sea will rise up out of its bed to eat them.)))</span></P>
