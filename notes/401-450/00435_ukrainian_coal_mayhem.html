<P>"CORRUPTION IN UKRAINE'S COAL INDUSTRY RUNS DEEP</P>

<P>By Roman Kupchinsky</P>

<P>"Reforming Ukraine's coal industry is one of the major
problems facing President Viktor Yushchenko and the
government of newly appointed Prime Minister
Yuliya Tymoshenko.</P>

<P>Link:<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.tymoshenko.com.ua/eng/news/first/show/1569/">http://www.tymoshenko.com.ua/eng/news/first/show/1569/</A>
"The Orange Princess" is quite a looker, but then,
so was Viktor Yushchenko before they poisoned
him with dioxin.</P>

<P>"Tymoshenko knows the power of coal from personal
experience. She tried to reform the industry while
she was deputy prime minister from 1999 to 2001. She
was abruptly removed from office in January 2001 by
former President Leonid Kuchma, charged with fraud
and money laundering, and jailed for several weeks.
The charges against her were eventually dismissed.
<span class="bluetext">(((On the other hand, if you're merely a journalist
instead of deputy prime minister, the natural gas
industry might have your head removed.)))</span><br>

<h2>"A Long-Neglected Industry</h2>

<P>"Ukraine has huge coal reserves, estimated at some
37 billion tons. The industry employs 450,000 people
and produced 90 million tons of coal in 2004.
</P>

<P>"According to the World Bank, approximately two-thirds
of Ukraine's 193 existing mines are unprofitable and
should be closed. Ukraine's coal industry has been
in a critical state of health for decades and
survives mainly due to subsidies from Kyiv,
which amounted to some $2 billion in 2003 and 2004.
<span class="bluetext">(((Maybe the Ukrainians should turn to nuclear &ndash;
oh wait, sorry, Chernobylians.)))</span></P>

<P>"Such subsidies are not nearly enough, however,
to maintain proper safety standards. In its August
2000 country brief on Ukraine, the U.S. Energy
Information Administration found that 'outdated
equipment, a lack of spare parts, and poor safety
procedures have resulted in safety problems and
lost production, exacerbating the industry's
inefficiency." <span class="bluetext">(((Imagine the mayhem they'd
wreak if they were efficient.  And imagine how
lame you have to be to depend on the "American
Energy Information Administration.")))</span></P>

<P>"The industry's lack of productivity has also been
calculated by the World Bank: 'While a coal miner
in Ukraine produced on average about 100 tons of
(washed) coal in 1995, the comparable figures were
200 tons in Russia, 400 tons in Poland, 2,000 tons
in the United Kingdom, and 4,000 tons in North
America.'  <span class="bluetext">((("Ukrainian coal miners: only one
fortieth as harmful as American ones.")))</span></P>


<P>"Most mines belong to state-owned coal enterprises
run by managers appointed by the Ministry of Fuel
and Energy, into which the Coal Ministry was
incorporated in 2000. During the two Kuchma
administrations, these two ministries were headed
by people close to the so-called Donetsk clan, an
informal grouping of business and political leaders
in that region.</P>

<P>"The Ukrainian Coal Ministry was described in a
December 1998 World Bank report, 'Restructuring
the Coal Industry in Ukraine,' as follows: 'Arranging
barter trades and bombarding the Finance Ministry
and cabinet with requests for additional investment
funds and production subsidies became the main
occupation of the Coal Ministry." <span class="bluetext">(((At least they
don't whine about drilling in the Arctic.)))</span></P>


<h2>"The Human Cost Of Coal Mining</h2>

<P>"The high rate of fatal accidents in the Ukrainian coal
industry is mainly due to criminal negligence,
industry officials in Kyiv say. Four miners in
Ukraine are killed for every 1 million tons
of coal extracted. Ukraine's coal industry is
considered the world's second deadliest, after China.
<span class="bluetext">((("After China, We're Number Two!")))</span></P>

<P>"More than 4,000 coal miners have died in accidents
in Ukraine since 1991.</P>

<P>"Timber, needed to construct mine shafts, is in
short supply in Ukraine and is often reused until
it rots, creating dangerous conditions."</P>

<P>Link:<BR>
<A HREF="http://wood.appua.com/sawn_timber/index.shtml">http://wood.appua.com/sawn_timber/index.shtml</A>
That's funny, it took me all of 30 seconds to find
all the Ukrainian timber one could need.</P>

<P>"Most mine fatalities in Ukraine are related to
methane gas explosions, <span class="bluetext">(((a Greenhouse
two-for-one)))</span> and most of these accidents take
place in mines that produce coking coal used in
the steel industry. These are also some of the
most profitable mines in the industry.</P>

<P>"A former deputy director of a coal enterprise
in the city of Krasny Luch in Luhansk Oblast told
RFE/RL that some fatal mine accidents in
coking-coal pits are connected to management
directives to extract up to three times the
daily norm of coal, for which miners
would receive double their monthly wages.
The average monthly wage of a Ukrainian coal miner
in January 2005 was 1,400 hryvnyas ($255).
<span class="bluetext">(((Luxury!)))</span></P>

<P>"However, existing ventilator systems that pump
out the deadly methane gas that is a byproduct
of mining are capable of removing only the amount
of methane released during normal levels of coal
extraction. The increased production results in
an excess of methane gas that, when mixed with
extra coal dust, often leads to fatal explosions.</p>

<p>To date, no mine director or enterprise manager
in Ukraine has been punished for allowing workers
to mine coal in unsafe conditions. Only lower-level
managers have so far been disciplined. <span class="bluetext">(((Given
that coal magnates behave this way to their own
employees, imagine how they feel about you.)))</span></P>

<h2>"Inefficiency And Corruption</h2>

<P>"Moreover, specialists in the Ukrainian coal
industry told RFE/RL that some profitable mines
are declared bankrupt and closed, then flooded
to prevent their collapse. The closures are used as
proof that the Fuel and Energy Ministry is
attempting to reform the industry. After some time,
however, these mines are bought by private
companies at far below their real value; the
new owners drain the water and resume profitable
mining. <span class="bluetext">(((Imagine if this kind of ingenuity
were devoted to reforming our planet's industrial
base.)))</span></P>

<P>"On 7 February, Mykhaylo Volynets, the head of
the Ukrainian Confederation of Trade Unions and
a member of the parliamentary Energy Committee,
told Ukrainian television that there are presently
6,000 illegal coal mines operating in Ukraine
that produce some 5 million tons of coal annually.
He said these unregistered mines employ women
and children, who work in unsafe conditions and
receive no social benefits. Volynets added that
local authorities and law enforcement agencies
in the Donbas Basin are aware of the existence
of these mines but are bribed to remain silent.
<span class="bluetext">((("Ukrainian Children: World's Least Efficient
Coal Miners.")))</span></P>

<h2>"Coking Coal And Accusations Of Steel Dumping</h2>

<P>"For the past decade, successive Ukrainian
governments have provided massive subsidies
to the coking-coal industry. This policy
has been, in fact, a subsidy to the metallurgical
industry by providing it with low-cost coke.
These subsidies, in turn, led to accusations
of Ukrainian manufacturers dumping steel onto world
markets.</P>

<P>"On her website, U.S. Senator Debbie Stabenow says
that 'from 1997 through 2000, carbon steel slab
imports [into the United States] from key producers
have risen dramatically: Brazil up 25 percent;
Mexico up 13 percent; Russia up 106 percent,
and Ukraine up 542 percent.'  <span class="bluetext">(((Lends a whole
new meaning to the term "high-carbon steel.")))</span></P>

<P>"The corruption-prone cycle  is
illustrated by the 2004 tender terms for
the privatization of the giant Kryvorizhstal
mining and smelting enterprise, which the
Yushchenko government is reviewing, saying that
it serves as an example of corruption under
Kuchma's regime.</P>

<P>"The terms announced for the tender
limited the sale to only two bidders: the
Investment-Metallurgical Union (IMU) consortium
and the Industrial Union of the Donbas. The IMU
is co-owned by Viktor Pinchuk, the son-in-law of
former President Kuchma, and Rinat Akhmetov, the
widely acknowledged leader of the Donetsk clan
and one of Ukraine's richest citizens. The IMU won
the tender, paying almost $800 million
for the enterprise, while others offering up
to $3 billion were disqualified. </P>

<h2>"The Politics Of Coal</h2>

<P>"The troubles in Ukraine's coal industry far
surpass those of other energy sectors.  <span class="bluetext">(((Why
am I not surprised?)))</span><BR>
-- Restructuring the coal industry would mean
the loss of hundreds of thousands of jobs in a
politically sensitive region. <span class="bluetext">((("Ukrainian Coal
Miners: We Can Out-Die Even the Chinese")))</span>
-- Retraining programs for coal miners are
not in place; the prospects for miners performing
other jobs are bleak. <span class="bluetext">(((Maybe they can be
replaced with their own children.)))</span>
-- Entire municipalities in the Donbas Basin
rely on the coal industry to pay for medical
care, schools, public transportation, and other
vital infrastructure. <span class="bluetext">(((Iron lungs, for instance.)))</span></P>

<P>"How the new Ukrainian government intends to
handle this problem is hard to forecast. Any
coal reforms are sure to provoke angry reactions
from vested interests in the Donbas Basin and from
members of parliament involved in the metallurgical
and energy-generation sectors of the economy.</P>

<P>"The Donbas has shown itself willing to raise
the specter of territorial separatism in order
to maintain existing coal subsidy policies and
schemes. <span class="bluetext">((("Welcome to the Ukrainian Coalistan.")))</span>
The country's eastern regions had also
threatened to secede as a possible response to
the Orange Revolution demonstrations in Kyiv.</P>

<P>"How real the threat of separatism is remains
questionable, but few have any doubts that the
owners and managers of the coking coal-coke-
metallurgical industries in Ukraine will lobby
to prevent the implementation of far-reaching
reforms and will continue to use coal as a
political weapon."</P>
