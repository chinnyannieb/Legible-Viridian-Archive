"Let's talk about climate change"  <span class="bluetext">(((Let's!)))</span><br>
Ian McEwan<br>
21 - 4 - 2005<br><br>
<p>"To address climate change and the political
challenges it raises, we must harness imagination
to understanding, good science to enlightened
globalisation, says Ian McEwan.
"The commonplace view of the earth from an airplane at 35,000 feet &ndash; a vista that would have astounded
Dickens or Darwin &ndash; can be instructive when we contemplate the fate of our earth. We see faintly,
or imagine we can, the spherical curve of the
horizon and, by extrapolation, sense how far we
would have to travel to circumnavigate, and how
tiny we are in relation to this home suspended in
sterile space. <span class="bluetext">(((For a novelist to cite Darwin
in his first paragraph a sign of distinct
A-OKness.)))</span></p>

<p>"When we cross the Canadian northern territories
en route to the American west coast, or the Norwegian
littoral, or the interior of Brazil, we are heartened to see that such vast empty spaces still exist &ndash; two hours might pass, and not a single road or track in view.
"But also large and growing larger is the great rim of grime &ndash; as though detached from an unwashed
bathtub &ndash; that hangs in the air as we head across the Alps into northern Italy, or the Thames basin, or Mexico City, Los Angeles, Beijing &ndash; the list is long and growing. These giant concrete stains
laced with steel, those catheters of ceaseless traffic filing towards the horizon &ndash; the natural world can only shrink before them.  <span class="bluetext">((("Rim o' grime,"
man!  I want the T-shirt!)))</span></p>
<p>"The sheer pressure of our numbers, the abundance of
our inventions, the blind forces of our desires and needs, appear unstoppable and are generating a heat &ndash;
the hot breath of our civilisation &ndash; whose effects we comprehend only hazily. The misanthropic
traveller, gazing down from his wondrous, and
wondrously dirty machine, is bound to ask
whether the earth might not be better off
without us.</p>

<p>"How can we ever begin to restrain ourselves?
We appear, at this distance, like a successful
lichen, a ravaging bloom of algae, a mould
enveloping a fruit. Can we agree among ourselves? 
We are a clever but quarrelsome species &ndash; in our public discourses we can sound like a rookery
in full throat. In our cleverness we are just 
beginning to understand that the earth &ndash; considered as a total system of organisms, environments,
climates and solar radiation, each reciprocally
shaping the other through hundreds of millions of 
years &ndash; is perhaps as complex as the human brain; as yet we understand only a little of that brain,
or of the home in which it evolved.</p>

<p>"Despite that near ignorance, or perhaps because of
it, reports from a range of scientific disciplines
are telling us with certainty that we are making a
mess of the earth, we are fouling our nest and we
have to act decisively and against our immediate
inclinations.  <span class="bluetext">(((Hear hear! Hubbub on back benches,
etc)))</span> For we tend to be superstitious, hierarchical
and self-interested, <span class="bluetext">(((This prose rocks, doesn't it?
Man, the British invented the English language!)))</span>
just when the moment requires us to be rational,
even-handed and altruistic.</p>
<p>"We are shaped by  our history and biology to frame
our plans within the short term, within the scale of
a single lifetime; and in democracies, governments
and electorates collude in an even tighter cycle of
promise and gratification. Now we are asked to
address the wellbeing of unborn individuals we
will never meet and who, contrary to the usual
terms of human interaction, will not be returning
the favour.</p>

<p>"To concentrate our minds, we have historical
examples of civilisations that have collapsed 
through environmental degradation &ndash; the Sumerian, the Indus Valley, Easter Island. They extravagantly
feasted on vital natural resources and died.
<span class="bluetext">(((You bet they died!  Probably because, unlike
McEwan, they failed to read Jared Diamond's
COLLAPSE, a text so inspirational that
David Brin reaches a personal height of lucidity)))</span>:
<br><A HREF="http://www.davidbrin.com/collapse.html">http://www.davidbrin.com/collapse.html</A>
"Those were test-tube cases, locally confined; 
now, increasingly, we are one, and we are informed &ndash;
reliably or not &ndash; that it is the whole laboratory,the whole glorious human experiment, that is at risk.
"And what do we have on our side to avert that
risk? Against all our deficits, certainly a talent
for co-operation; we can take comfort from the
memory of the Partial Test-Ban Treaty (1963), made
at a time of hostility and mutual suspicion between
the cold war superpowers. More recently, the
discovery of ozone depletion in the upper
atmosphere and worldwide agreement to ban
chlorofluorocarbon (CFC) production should also
give us heart. <span class="bluetext">(((The British are still worried
that the Gulf War was "against the law."  That
was the point of it, fellows.)))</span></p>

<p>"Secondly, globalisation has not  only unified
economies, it has focussed global opinion to
put pressure on governments to take action.
"But above all, we have our rationality,
which finds it highest expression and
formalisation in good science. <span class="bluetext">(((Check that out,
man!  A true-blue litterateur praising science!
Mars must be in Aquarius, or something.)))</span>
The adjective is  important. We need accurate
representations  of the state of the earth.
The environmental  movement has been let down
by dire predictions, 'scientifically' based,
which over the past two  or three decades have
proved spectacularly wrong.  Of itself, this
does not invalidate dire scientific
predictions now, but it makes the case for 
scepticism &ndash; one of the engines of good science. We need not only reliable data, but their expression
in the rigorous use of statistics.  <span class="bluetext">(((Mathematicians
rejoice.)))</span></p> 

<p>"Well-meaning intellectual movements, from communism
to post-structuralism, have a poor history of
absorbing inconvenient data or challenges to
fundamental precepts. We should not ignore or 
suppress good indicators on the environment &ndash;
and there are quite a few &ndash; simply because they do not make the advocate's case. It is tempting
to embrace with enthusiasm the latest bleak scenario
because it fits our mood. <span class="bluetext">(((Especially if we are
Ian McEwan.)))</span> But we should be asking, or expecting
others to ask, for the provenance of the data, the
assumptions fed into the computer model, the
response of the peer review community, and so on.
<span class="bluetext">(((Amen!  Preach it, brother!)))</span></p>

<p>"Pessimism is intellectually delicious, even thrilling,
but the matter before us is too serious for mere
self-pleasuring. <span class="bluetext">(((You don't know what it costing
McEwan to say this.  It's as if Donald Rumsfeld
confessed that he likes to dress up as a goth.)))</span>
It would be self-defeating, if the environmental
movement degenerated into a religion of gloomy
faith. (Faith, ungrounded certainty, is no virtue).
It was good science, not good intentions, that
identified the ozone problem, and it led, fairly
promptly, to good policy.</p>
<p>"The wide view from the airplane suggests that
whatever our environmental problems are, they
will have to be dealt with by international laws.
No single nation is going to restrain its
industries while its neighbours' are unfettered.
<span class="bluetext">(((Well, we never had an international law
that required us to surround the planet with
a rim of grime. It just plain happened.)))</span>
Here too, an enlightened  globalisation might be
of use. And good international  law might need
to use not our virtues, but our  weaknesses
(greed, self-interest) to lever a  cleaner
environment; in this respect, the newly
devised market in carbon trading was a crafty
first move.  <span class="bluetext">(((Everybody's a climate wonk.
And why not?  It's the biggest story in the world.)))</span></p>

<p>"The climate change debate is hedged by uncertainties.
Can we avoid what is coming at us, or is there
nothing much coming at all? Are we at the beginning
of an unprecedented era of international cooperation,
or are we living in an Edwardian summer of reckless
denial? Is this the beginning, or the end? We need
to talk.  <span class="bluetext">(((Dickens:  "It was the best of times,
it was the worst of times...)))</span></p>

online debate on the politics of climate change.
The debate was developed in partnership with the
British Council as part of their ZeroCarbonCity 
initiative &ndash; a two year global campaign to raise awareness and stimulate debate around the
challenges of climate change."</p>
