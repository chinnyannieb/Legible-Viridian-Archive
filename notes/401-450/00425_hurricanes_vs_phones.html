<p style="font-weight: bold;">"Storms Cause Greater Outages In New Fiber-Optic Networks As BellSouth Races to Recover</p>

<P>"By Peter Grant<BR>
Staff Reporter of THE WALL STREET JOURNAL
September 17, 2004; Page B1</P>

"<p>CHARLOTTE, N.C. &ndash; Ron Royster stepped out yesterday
  for only a few minutes from BellSouth Corp.'s command center here,
  where technicians closely monitor the havoc Hurricane Ivan is
  wreaking on its phone network. But as soon as Mr. Royster,
  the center's director, returned, he could tell conditions had deteriorated.</p>

<P><span class="bluetext">((("Conditions Are Deteriorating."  The climate-change motto.
Could be a cafe-press sweatshirt.)))</span></P>

<P>"It was midmorning. Until then, Ivan's impact had been manageable.
But an alarm in the Network Reliability Center indicated a fire
may have erupted at a central phone office in Marion, Ala.
Another office reported that its backup electrical generator had stopped working, forcing it to go on batteries. Most worrisome, the storm had severed fiber-optic lines &ndash; the lifeline of modern communications networks &ndash; in Pensacola, Fla., and on the Alabama-Mississippi state line.</P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<BR>

<P>"'Things went downhill pretty fast,' said Mr. Royster, who
hasn't had a day off since Aug. 29 as the Southeast has been
pounded by three back-to-back hurricanes.  <span class="bluetext">(((I wonder
if Mr. Royster's had a day off since.)))</span></P>

<P>"It was round one in Ivan vs. BellSouth, which provides local phone service to tens of millions of people in nine Southeastern states &ndash; all in Ivan's path. And it isn't exactly a fair fight. BellSouth's disaster-recovery resources already have been stretched thin by the two hurricanes that hit Florida, Charley and Frances.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((This WSJ report was written before Jeanne arrived.)))</span>
Link:<BR>
http://www.floridatoday.com/!NEWSROOM/hurricane/jeannegallery.htm</P>

<P>"Furthermore, because of fiber optics and other new technologies
BellSouth has added to upgrade its networks over the past decade,
the systems are, ironically, more vulnerable to disasters.
<span class="bluetext">(((Only the Wall Street Journal considers it "ironic"
that extensive investment in delicate machinery leads
to bigger losses.)))</span></P>

<P>"The key problem: Many phone networks that used to rely
on their own electricity now depend partly on commercial power.
That means that when the utility company's power lines
go down, the phones may go down, too. <span class="bluetext">(((That was clever.... Are you listening, Californians? Imagine
a series of market-rigged brownouts that make your
phones and net collapse as well as your air conditioning.)))</span></P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((And since the utilities and phone companies use
fossil fuels, this Wall Street tale officially qualifies
as a "Wexelblat disaster!")))</span></P>

<P>The first mention of the now-legendary phenomenon
of "Wexelblat Disaster."<BR>
<br><a href="../76-100/00084.html">http://www.viridiandesign.org/notes/76-100/00084.html</A></P>

<P>"Like other regional Bell companies, BellSouth prides itself
on its ability to maintain service during disasters and restore
it quickly when it fails. Phone executives love to tell stories
of the numerous times that people have been able to use their
telephones during power failures.</P>


<P>"These stories are about more than bragging rights. In today's
fiercely competitive <span class="bluetext">(((why does the WSJ believe this?)))</span>
telecommunications market, dealing with adversity is a
major selling point. Phone companies have been quick to
point out that many of the new phone services offered by
some cable companies and others using Internet technology
often go out in power outages. Now, with their new local
fiber networks, phone companies are more vulnerable on
this score.</P>

<P>"To improve reliability,  <span class="bluetext">(((yeah sure)))</span> BellSouth
in 1995 consolidated 42  recovery facilities into two,
one in Charlotte and the other  in Nashville. <span class="bluetext">(((I don't
suppose this had much to do with reducing employee
headcount.)))</span> The recent spate of hurricanes has put those
centers through their toughest test yet.</P>

<P>(...)</P>

<P>"Phone companies had unparalleled reliability records
when their networks consisted of copper wires that
stretched from central offices to homes and workplaces
with nothing in between. The copper lines not only carry
calls but low-voltage electrical power as well.</P>

<P>"That is why phones generally have continued to work
even when the local power company's lines went out.
In addition, the central offices have their own backup
power supplies that kick in during power outages.
As a result, most service failures have been due to
lines that were downed by fallen trees or car accidents.</P>

<P>"But in the past decade, phone companies added fiber optics
and devices known as 'digital loop carriers,' small
file-cabinet-sized pieces of equipment, between central
offices and homes. The devices have greatly boosted the
capacity of the lines, cutting costs and making new services
including high-speed Internet connections possible.</P>

<P>"The digital-loop devices also run on electricity from the local power company's network, however.  <span class="bluetext">(((Uh-oh.)))</span> 
While they are equipped with batteries, that backup lasts 
only about eight hours &ndash; <span class="bluetext">(((Get some solar PV and trickle 
those batteries up, for heaven's sake)))</span> and less if there's 
a lot of Internet traffic over the network. <span class="bluetext">(((Like during massive weather havoc, for instance.)))</span></P>

<!-- end of formatted text output as "NORMAL" -->
<BR>

<P>"Once the batteries run out, phone and Internet service goes dead
<span class="bluetext">(((whoopee)))</span> unless a backup generator can be installed.
<span class="bluetext">(((Bring plenty of diesel.)))</span>  While some digital-loop carriers
have a generator, BellSouth says it would be economically
unfeasible to put a generator at all 65,000 of them.  <span class="bluetext">((("Solar?"
This is Florida!  We never heard of sunshine!")))</span></P>

<P>"BellSouth officials say they are exploring ways to make
the batteries last longer. 'We constantly look for technological
advances that would allow us to have a better safety margin,'
says Richard Burns, the vice president responsible for BellSouth's
network-operations support. 'But it's only in these huge,
widespread natural disasters that commercial power failures
last long enough, and are widespread enough, to have a
significant impact."  <span class="bluetext">(((In other words, you can destroy
a power generator for whatever reason, and instantly deprive a stricken region of  power, phone, and Net access all at once.)))</span> "Initially, Hurricane Frances knocked out phone service for 775,000 BellSouth subscribers &ndash; 13% of its Florida customer base. Most of that was due to <span class="bluetext">(((Oh for heaven's sake.)))</span> power losses, not from downed lines.</p>

<P>"By contrast, only 350,000 customers lost service at the height
of Hurricane Andrew in 1992, before many of the BellSouth
networks were upgraded. A large part of the difference is because
Andrew hit only two counties, while Frances hit all of BellSouth's
Florida operations. But Frances's larger impact also was
due to the system's new susceptibility to power outages,
BellSouth executives say. "Wireless phone service was also affected. <span class="bluetext">(((Figures.)))</span> 
While cellphone towers are built to withstand hurricane-force 
winds &ndash; and most did &ndash; they use power to transmit their 
signals. And in areas where the power went out, the towers' 
backup power, a combination of generators and batteries, 
also sometimes failed.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((Sounds like a textbook example of "brittle power.")))</span>

<br><a href="http://www.rmi.org/sitepages/pid1011.php">http://www.rmi.org/sitepages/pid1011.php</A></P>

<P>"In Mobile, Ala., 38% of Cingular Wireless's coverage
area lost service, in Biloxi, Miss., 32% lost service,
while in Birmingham, Ala., about 23% lost service, says
Calie Shackleford, a Cingular  spokeswoman. Cingular is
owned by BellSouth and SBC Communications Corp.</P>

<P>"Power was very much on the minds of the 50 or so
technicians who manned the BellSouth disaster recovery
center in Charlotte yesterday. They watched as the number
of central offices on backup generators climbed to 118
at midafternoon, from 63 at about noon. Even more
worrisome were those that were relying on batteries,
meaning their generators had failed and they had about
eight hours of juice left. If one died, thousands of
homes and offices would lose their phone service.</P>

<P><span class="bluetext">(((It's a breathless High Mass of technological decline.)))</span></P>

<P>"Fortunately, all the central offices that switched to
batteries did so for only a few minutes while generators
were refueled.  (...)</P>

<P>"But other problems erupted. On other screens technicians
monitored the number of digital-loop carriers that were on
batteries and the number that had failed, meaning their
batteries had died. By midafternoon, 397 had failed and
1,193 were running on batteries. Each one conducts service
to as many as 500 households. The ones that fail won't be
fixed until the commercial power goes back on or crews
attach backup generators.</P>

<P>"As Ivan moved north, BellSouth officials moved forward
quickly with their recovery plan for areas hit first. A fleet of
trucks with 600 emergency generators that had been parked</P>

<!-- Outputting formatted text as "NORMAL" -->

<P>at a staging area south of Valdosta, Ga., began to move out.
By noon, 11 tankers with diesel and unleaded gas &ndash; to fuel
the generators and repair trucks &ndash; were rolling from Jasper,
Fla., to three sites in Alabama. By midafternoon, 114
digital-loop carriers were working on generators.

"As of late afternoon yesterday, 350,600 customers
had lost their phone service due to Hurricane Ivan &ndash;
most of that due to the loss of local power."</P>
