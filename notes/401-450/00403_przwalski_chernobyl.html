<P>The concept of the Viridian "involuntary park" 
is a  persistent one.  Involuntary parks 
are not natural parks, but places so devastated 
by human misuse that people can't live there 
any more. 
<br><a href="http://home.ecn.ab.ca/~puppydog/involun.htm">http://home.ecn.ab.ca/~puppydog/involun.htm</A></P>

<P>As we Viridians have pointed out on a number 
of occasions, the world is becoming uninsurable. This means more abandoned areas and many 
more involuntary parks in future.

<P>Disaster tourists do tour Chernobyl, and might even weblog the experience.

<P>Among the wilder developments in this Rhode Island-sized Chernobyl "zone of alienation" 
was the deliberate
release of primordial "Przewalski horses."  These 
ancient horses are now running wild across the 
radioactive wasteland. The Przewalski home page:

<P>Mary Mycio, who works in the Ukraine, 
is writing a book about Chernobyl which 
contemplates the topic of involuntary parks. 
Mary Mycio (myciomar*irex.kiev.ua) remarks:</P>

<P>"A total of 21 horses were released a few years ago. 
Today, there are 65. I saw one of the herds in December
and it's doing very well. One hundred percent of the 
mature mares foaled.</P>

<P>"The Chernobyl zone on the Ukrainian side is highly 
regulated.  About 5,000 people work in zone management
and another 5,000 or so work at the decommissioned 
power plant. But they are largely concentrated at the 
plant and the town of Chernobyl 11 miles away.  The 
rest of the territory is largely uninhabited, though 
it is also managed, especially for fire safety. 
The Belarus part of the zone is more like a 
park, and far less regulated."</P>

<P>Mary Mycio has also been kind enough to share 
with us an article she wrote in 2002, for the 
Los Angeles Times, about her own encounter with 
Chernobyl and its ever-more-flourishing wildlife.</P>

<P>"Visitors can see rare horses and breathe surprisingly fresh air in a strange twist on 
adventure tourism at the site of reactor disaster."</P>

<P>"By MARY MYCIO, SPECIAL TO THE TIMES 
May 11, 2002</P>

<DL>
  <DT>"CHERNOBYL, Ukraine </DT><DD>= Yuri Zayets pointed his 
  binoculars toward a distant copse of birches and
  shouted excitedly from midway up the fire tower:
  'They're over there, grazing near the forest.'
  </DD></DL>

<P>"It had taken nearly two hours of driving through the 
unique radioactive wilderness born of the 1986 
Chernobyl nuclear disaster to find them, but one of 
the world's few wild herds of rare Przewalski horses 
finally came into view.</P>

<P>"'Stay here,' Denis Vishnevsky, a zoologist with the 
Chernobyl Ecology Center, said after the group of 
official guides and a journalist piled out of their 
minibus to see the short but powerfully robust horses,
introduced here in 1998 to eat what was supposedly 
'excess' vegetation in the depopulated area. 
'They'll come to us.'</P>

<P>"'Chernobyl safaris,' mused Rima Kiselytsia, a guide 
with Chernobylinterinform, the agency that shepherds 
all visitors to the 'Zone of Alienation' around the 
now-decommissioned reactor, an area that once was home
to 135,000 people. 'It's a strange idea, but I like 
it.'</P>

<P>"Chernobyl tourism has been a hot topic in Ukraine 
since January, when a U.N. report urged Chernobyl 
communities to learn to live safely with radiation &ndash; 
such as consuming only produce grown outside the zone.
The report suggested specialized tourism as one of 
several possible ways to bring money into a region that
has swallowed more than $100 billion in subsidies from
Soviet, Ukrainian and international government funds 
since the nuclear accident 16 years ago.</P>

<P>"Back in the town of Chernobyl, where the zone's 
administration manages the Rhode Island-sized no man's
land around the destroyed reactor, one official said 
economic benefits of tourism will never be more than 
minor. But he doesn't reject the idea outright.</P>

<P>"'The U.N. is 12 years too late,' said Mykola
Dmytruk, deputy director of Chernobylinterinform, 
referring to technicians who have been coming to the 
zone for that long. 'We've been allowing tours since 
1994.'</P>

<P>"A few Kiev tourist agencies advertise Chernobyl
excursions on their Web sites, but so far the zone 
administration doesn't actively promote the idea. 
'A great deal still isn't known,' said Dmytruk, ' 
and we warn everyone about the risks, even scientists.'</P>

<P>"The risks, while small, are real. And so is the
desolation. But the aftermath of the accident has 
created a misleading stereotype of the zone as a 
toxic wasteland, a nuclear desert devoid of life, 
and certainly not a place a sane person would want 
to visit. In fact, by ending industrialization, 
deforestation, cultivation and other human intrusions,
radiation has transformed the zone into one of 
Europe's largest wildlife habitats, a fascinating and 
at times beautiful wildness teeming with large animals
such as moose, wolves, boar and deer.</P>

<P>"It now is home to 270 bird species, 31 of them
endangered &ndash; making the zone one of the few places in
Europe to spot rarities such as black storks and booted
eagles. And traveling to Chernobyl may qualify as a 
kind of adventure tourism. The very knowledge of the 
buzzing background of radiation imbues even the prosaic
act of walking down the street with an aura of 
excitement. It isn't the same adrenalin punch as 
bungee jumping in the Andes, but it is a palpable 
sensation &ndash; like being surrounded by ghosts.</P>

<P>"By law, no one can enter the zone without
permission. But except for children under 17, the 
administration may give permission to pretty much 
anyone. The vast majority of the nearly 1,000 annual 
visitors are scientists, journalists, politicians and 
international nuclear officials, but the zone has 
hosted a handful of what Dmytruk calls 'pure' tourists
&ndash; including three Japanese in 2000 &ndash; and it can put 
together customized programs, such as safaris in search
of Przewalski horses, which some experts believe are 
the ancestors of all domestic horses but are far more 
aggressive than their domestic counterparts.</P>

<P>"'If a group of Californians want to go bird-
watching, we can organize that,' Dmytruk said, adding,
'so long as they know the difference between plutonium
and potatoes.'  Of course, Chernobyl isn't Club Med. 
But more than 15 years after the fourth reactor block 
spewed radiation around the globe, the risks are mostly
manageable. About a quarter of the cesium and strontium
have already decayed, and 95% of the remaining 
radioactive molecules are no longer in fallout that can
get on or inside a visitor, but have sunk to a depth of
about five inches in the soil.</P>

<P>"From there, they have insinuated themselves into
the food chain, making the zone's diverse and abundant
flora and fauna radioactive indeed. An antler shed 
recently by one Chernobyl elk was stuffed with so much
strontium that it cannot be allowed out of the zone. 
But three Przewalski foals born in the wild, while 
radioactive, have grown to adolescence with no visible
effects.  Such radioactivity now has receded to the 
background. On an average day, a visitor might receive
an extra radiation dose about equivalent to taking a 
two-hour plane trip, zone officials say.  That is, if 
the visitor follows the strict but simple safety rules:
'Don't eat local food, stay on the pavement, and go 
only where your guide takes you,' Dmytruk said.</P>

<P>"It is almost impossible to smell fresher air in an
urban setting than here in the town of Chernobyl, where
the number of cars seen on a warm April day could be 
counted on one hand and songbirds frequently provide 
the only sound.</P>

<P>"'It is one of the zone's many paradoxes, but
because human activity is banned nearly everywhere, 
the region is one of Ukraine's environmentally 
cleanest,' Dmytruk said. 'Except for radiation.'</P>

<P>"Today, villages are slowly succumbing to
encroaching forests. In the abandoned town of Pripyat,
less than two miles from the nuclear reactor, empty 
black windows stare blindly from high-rise buildings at
kindergartens littered with heartbreakingly small gas 
masks. It may seem like an odd place for a rewarding 
tourism experience. But nowhere else can a visitor 
stand amid a herd of wild Przewalski horses like a 
character in Jean Auel's Ice Age novels, or watch a 
pair of rare white-tailed eagles circling above the ghostly high-rises of Pripyat, a 
moving monument to the
devastating effects of technology gone awry, and 
nature's near miraculous resilience and recovery."</P>
