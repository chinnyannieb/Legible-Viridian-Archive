<P><strong>"Schwarzenegger's Solar Power Promise Is Back</strong><br>
"Governor-backed Bill, SB 1, aims for a Million Solar Roofs in 10 Years,
"Making California World's Solar Leader</P>

<P>"Sacramento &ndash; Governor Schwarzenegger officially
announced language today aimed at achieving his Million
Solar Roofs initiative and keeping the promise he made
to California voters over a year ago. The language will
become part of SB 1, a bi-partisan bill co-authored by
Senators Murray (D-LA) and Campbell (R-Orange County).</P>

<P>"'Hands down, SB 1 is the biggest environmental bill
of the year,' said Bernadette Del Chiaro, clean energy
advocate with Environment California. "The Governor's
solar promise, in the form of SB 1, will bring
California cleaner air, greater energy independence,
economic development and a self-sufficient solar
market within a decade."  <span class="bluetext">(((You know what I like
about solar?  There aren't any 'weapons of mass
solar destruction.'  Admittedly, the energy comes
from a giant hydrogen bomb, but the thing's 90
million miles away.)))</span></P>

<P>"Major elements of SB 1 are:</P>

<P>"Require the California Public Utilities Commission
(PUC) to establish a new, ten-year-fund to provide
rebates for 3,000 MW of solar photovoltaic systems
on a million new and existing homes and businesses.
The rebate will be required to decline each year
and sunset in 2016 to help drive down prices and
ensure a self-sufficient solar market in ten years.
<span class="bluetext">(((I know that sounds boring, but it's stuff like
this that may yet save our bacon.)))</span></P>

<P>"Require all builders of large-scale single-family
homes to offer solar power systems to homebuyers
beginning in 2010. Industry research shows
approximately 10% of California homebuyers will
choose solar roofs when offered. California current
builds around 1% of its homes with solar power.
<span class="bluetext">(((I wonder what happens if 90% of Californians
suddenly think solar panels are a great idea.)))</span></P>

<P>"Raise the net metering cap &ndash; the ability for
customers to receive a credit from their utility
company for excess electricity generated by their
solar system &ndash; from 0.5% of peak load to 2% and
then an additional 5% after review by the PUC.
<span class="bluetext">(((Good luck getting the utilities to pay you &ndash;
last thing I heard, the "pirate generators" were
still sitting on a massive hoard of brazenly
fleeced Californian money.)))</span></P>

<P>"Meanwhile, tomorrow in the state's capitol,
Germany’&Auml;&ocirc;s top energy policy maker who has turned
Germany into the world's second largest market
for solar power will speak with California policy
makers at a lunch briefing in the capitol about
how California could become the world's solar
energy leader.  <span class="bluetext">(((Sunnier than Europe.)))</span></P>

Hermann Scheer, charismatic Eurosolar wonk on the
loose in California<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.hermann-scheer.de/">http://www.hermann-scheer.de/</A></P>

<P>"'In Germany, we have found that solar power is
beneficial to our overall economy, bringing new
industry, jobs and stable electric rates,' said
Dr. Hermann Scheer, member of the German Parliament
and the Parliamentary Assembly of Europe, and
author of policies that have made Germany home
to the world's second largest solar market, just
behind Japan. 'I strongly encourage California
to make a solar power commitment similar to
Germany and Japan. With the amount of annual
sunshine and rapid economic growth, California
would easily become the global leader in the
solar industry.'"</P>
