<span class="bluetext">(((I'm often mildly surprised when I examine my email
and Google News and find the plethora of Viridian
issues in the mainstream press.  This week, it's
climate change and green energy right left and center.
The day approaches when, as a futurist, I get
to declare victory and go home.   Not that we get a
victory over the Greenhouse -- I likely won't live
long enough to see that -- but I'll definitely live
long enough to see my 1990s fringe issue become the
vital stuff of everyday discourse.  And when that
happens, it will behoove me to devote my small
energies to some topic that's a bit more far-out.)))</span></P>

<P><strong>Power Generating Microbes -- (WorldChanging.com --

<br><a href="http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/002857.html">http://www.worldchanging.com/archives/002857.html</a><br>
Microbiologists report finding a species of
bacteria able to both remediate some pretty nasty
industrial chemicals and produce usable amounts
of electricity while doing so. The technology could
be used to assist in the reclamation of wastewaters,
resulting in the removal of waste and generation
of electricity.  <span class="bluetext">(((Wow.)))</span></P>

<P><strong>Clearing Smoke May Trigger Global Warming Rise --
(New Scientist -- June 29, 2005)</strong>
<br><a href="http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7607">http://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn7607</a><br>
Three top climate researchers claim that the
greenhouse gases already in the atmosphere should
have warmed the world more than they have.
The reason they have not, they say, is that the
warming is being masked by sun-blocking smoke,
dust and other polluting particles put into the
air by human activity. Their best guess is that,
as the mask is removed due to controls on
pollution, temperatures will warm by at least
6 C by 2100.<BR>
<span class="bluetext">(((Life is full of little ironies.)))</span></P>

<P><strong>Insurers Sound the Alarm on Climate Change --
(Financial Times -- June 28, 2005)</strong>
<br><a href="http://news.ft.com/cms/s/84370f42-e7f8-11d9-9786-00000e2511c8.html">http://news.ft.com/cms/s/<br>84370f42-e7f8-11d9-9786-00000e2511c8.html</a><br>
Global climate changes are expected to influence
financial markets and leaders are taking these
risks into account when making decisions on
insurance underwriting, investments, or credit.
The cost worldwide of storms, expected to become
more frequent owing to climate change, is likely
to rise by two-thirds to 15bn ($27bn, 22bn) a
year in the next seven decades according to the
Association of British Insurers. Some of the costs,
however, could be avoided by taking preventative
measures including improved coastal defenses to
reduce global annual damage.<BR>
<span class="bluetext">(((Oh yeah.  Coastal dikes everywhere.  That sounds
cheap and sensible, eh?  They're gonna go broke
and they're gonna sue Exxon.)))</span></P>

<P><strong>Slowing Currents Could Cause Catastrophe --
(Stuff -- June 1, 2005)</strong>
<br><a href="http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/0,2106,3298684a11,00.html">http://www.stuff.co.nz/stuff/<br>0,2106,3298684a11,00.html</a><br>
Scientists have detected evidence of a slowdown in
ocean currents that control climate across the globe,
supporting earlier research on the threats of global
warming. Without these currents, parts of the globe
are expected to alter dramatically. The climate in
Europe would cool significantly, while New Zealand
would be warmer and more susceptible to exotic
diseases, scientists suggest.<BR>
<span class="bluetext">(((Pray it goes real, real slow.)))</span></P>

<P><strong>How Much Excess Fresh Water Was Added to the North
Atlantic in Recent Decades? -- (Science Daily --
June 19, 2005)</strong>
<br><a href="http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/06/050619121942.htm">http://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2005/06/050619121942.htm</a><br>
Large regions of the North Atlantic Ocean have
been growing fresher since the late 1960s as melting
glaciers and increased precipitation, both associated
with greenhouse warming, have enhanced continental
runoff into the Arctic and sub-Arctic seas.
But, until now, the actual amounts and rates of
fresh water accumulation have not been explicitly
known. A new report shows patterns of fresh water
accumulation over the past four decades suggesting
a freshening threshold, important to the ocean
circulation and its poleward transport of heat,
could be reached in a century.  <span class="bluetext">(((This is the
sort of thing that would actually repay "more
study" if opponents of warming actually funded
the "studies" they always cite.)))</span></P>

<P><strong>Space Ring Could Shade Earth and Stop Global
Warming -- (Live Science -- June 27, 2005)</strong>
<br><a href="http://livescience.com/technology/050627_warming_solution.html">http://livescience.com/technology/050627_warming_solution.html</a><br>
A wild idea to combat global warming suggests
creating an artificial ring of small particles
or spacecrafts around Earth to shade the tropics
and moderate climate extremes. The ring of particles
or spacecraft casting a shadow on equatorial Earth
might be kept in place by gravitationally significant
shepherding spacecraft. They would herd the particles
much like small moons keep Saturn's rings in place.
<span class="bluetext">(((Nutcase "solution" of the week, but it makes
a certain sense if smoky pollution  is already
shading us in our own atmosphere -- because at least
we wouldn't have to BREATHE a giant zillion-dollar
homemade Saturnian ring.)))</span></P>

<P><strong>Desert dunes set to roam -- (Nature -- June 29, 2005)</strong>
<br><a href="http://www.nature.com/news/2005/050627/full/050627-9.html">http://www.nature.com/news/2005/050627/full/050627-9.html</a><br>
Sand dunes in the Kalahari Desert in Africa, which
have been immobile for thousands of years, will soon
start to move again, researchers warn. The wandering
dunes may affect hundred of thousands of people in
southern Africa. Scientists' simulations revealed
a significant increase in dune activity in the
southern Kalahari by 2039. By 2099, sand dunes
throughout South Africa, Angola and Zambia will
be on the move, they predict; such a phenomenon
has not occurred in the past 14,000 to 16,000 years.
