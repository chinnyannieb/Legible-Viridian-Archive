<P><strong>"DEFECTS CROPPING UP IN SEATTLE BUILDINGS</strong></P>

<P>"Seattle's new City Hall and Justice Center, both
touted as cutting edge and environmentally
friendly, are suffering from defects that range
from serious to annoying.</P>

<P>"Boilers have exploded. <span class="bluetext">(((Oh dear.)))</span><BR>
Air conditioners don't work right. <span class="bluetext">(((Hmmm.)))</span>
A natural ventilation system hasn't worked. <span class="bluetext">(((How
natural!)))</span> Neither have the light shelves.
<span class="bluetext">(((Huh?)))</span></P>

<P>"A much-ballyhooed green roof turned brown. <span class="bluetext">(((!)))</span>
Although City Councilman Richard Conlin is
concerned about these issues, overall, he said
he was 'pretty happy' with the way the new
Civic Center buildings have turned out. 
'We're kind of on the cutting edge 
of some of these design issues. <span class="bluetext">((("Cutting-edge"
equals "breaks down tomorrow.")))</span></P>

<P>"It's not surprising some of it hasn't worked
as well as we'd hoped and needs adjusting,'
Conlin said.</P>

The Seattle Justice Center.</P>

<P>"Several problems are related to heating and air
conditioning control systems that leave some
offices too hot and some too cold. The equipment
was supposed to be more energy efficient, but
right now 'tenants are uncomfortable and we are
wasting money heating/cooling air that is not
reaching the end user,' a city report says.
<span class="bluetext">(((In Seattle, guys who turn on air conditioners
get to call themselves 'end users.')))</span></P>


<P>"The glass-entryway added to the base of the
Seattle Municipal Tower has been plagued by a
'poorly designed' natural ventilation system.
Designed without heaters and dehumidification,
the area has condensation and wet floors, posing
risks. <span class="bluetext">(((What could be more natural than wet,
dripping floors in Seattle? Call in the banana
slugs!)))</span></P>

the drippy Seattle Municipal Tower.</P>

<P>"City Hall's light shelves installed on west-
facing windows are causing glare and heat and
are 'viewed as both imposing and ugly 
by occupants.' The cost to replace them with
standard lighting is estimated at $590,000."
<span class="bluetext">(((Keep the 'light shelves' &ndash; anything 'imposing'
and 'ugly' that is placed on a public building
is guaranteed to become beloved within ten

<P>"Innovative turkey-to-oil plant eats money,
spits out fowl odor"</P>

<P>By KAREN DILLON The Kansas City Star</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
 <P>"CARTHAGE, Mo. &ndash; The eyes of the world have been 
 on this Missouri town for several years to see if
 a New York businessman can really turn turkey
 leftovers into oil.</P>

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>"The answer: A resounding yes. In fact, a revolutionary
plant is turning 270 tons of poultry waste into 300
barrels of crude oil every day.</P>

<P>"That would be cause for wild celebration in many
circles if not for two not-so-minor problems.</P>

<P>"First, the plant is losing buckets of money, and
second, some residents of the town that once
welcomed it now pretty much hate it.</P>

<P>"It turns out that process of cooking turkey guts,
feathers, feces and other waste gives off a
horrible stench. <span class="bluetext">(((What? Really? Wow!)))</span></P>

<P>"'It's rotten,' said Beth Longstaff, a resident who
was shopping at Wal-Mart recently. 'You can't get
away from it. It's like something out of a
horror movie.'</P>

<P>"Residents have responded with hundreds of complaints
to company, city, state and federal officials.</P>

<P>"The stink has sparked the concern of government
officials, including members of Missouri's
congressional delegation who helped the plant
get federal grants to try the new technology.</P>

<P>"Without the first $5 million grant, the plant
probably never would have opened, but now it's
burning through money so fast that the future is
in doubt.</P>

<P>"'My obstacles are enormous,' said Brian Appel,
the man behind the plant.</P>

<P>"The turkey oil is much more expensive to produce
than projected &ndash; the cost of a barrel is double
what it sells for. <span class="bluetext">(((Yeah, but we can make that
up in volume!)))</span></P>

<P>"Appel told The Kansas City Star recently that
he doubts the process can be financially successful
in the United States for several years.</P>

<P>"His company, Changing World Technology, <span class="bluetext">(((a
rather popular coinage)))</span> has put on hold plans to
build more plants in Colorado, Alabama and Nevada.</P>

<P>"Instead, he is considering a deal to build a plant
in Ireland, where costs would be considerably less,
and where a recent news article predicted a plant
should be operating by next year. Appel also is
negotiating with officials in Italy and Germany.
<span class="bluetext">(((Maybe he can "leapfrog" the technology into
some place that already smells worse than burning
turkey feathers.)))</span></P>

<P>"He doesn't know what the future of the Carthage
plant holds, but he wants to make it work.</P>

<P>"'I owe it to the people who have been really
supportive of what we plan to do, to do everything
in my power to turn that around,' Appel said.
But, he said, 'I don't know how long I can keep
funding this."</P>

<P>"Several federal and state officials said they
were unaware of Appel's negotiations overseas but
haven't lost enthusiasm for the project.</P>

<P>"'The congressman believes in the technology,' said
Dan Wadlington, spokesman for U.S. Rep. Roy Blunt
of Missouri.</P>

<P>"'Two hundred tons of turkey guts and feathers, and
you come up with 100 barrels of refineable oil &ndash; it's
a heck of a deal.' <span class="bluetext">(((Imagine if ALL crude oil
products smelled like burning turkey feathers.
Maybe the oil business would never have come to be!)))</span></P>

<P>"Antiques and poultry</P>

<P>"In 2000, Carthage officials celebrated when they
learned their town would be home to the world's
first commercial demonstration plant to 
turn turkey waste into oil.</P>

<P>"Scientists had been tinkering with the technology
for 30 years and it now seemed set to become a reality.</P>

<P>"The southwest Missouri town had been better known
for art and tourism than for pioneering industry.</P>

<P>"The Precious Moments Chapel south of town has been
a major attraction for years, and the town square,
with one of the oldest courthouses in the state,
is going through a rejuvenation of sorts. Trendy cafes
have opened, and so have collectible and antique shops.
Paintings, statues and sculptures decorate many spots
around the square. <span class="bluetext">(((Now that China has outsourced
every heavy industry on the planet, it's up to the
rest of us to sell each other vanilla-flavored coffee
and our grandparents' possessions.)))</span></P>

<P>"Just four blocks off the town square is the industrial
district where Appel located the plant. It seemed
logical because ConAgra's turkey Butterball plant was
already there and would supply the offal to the
plant.</P>

<P>"Appel's company remains protective of the plant's
technology. After promising a 30-minute tour, a
plant official on a recent rainy day would only
show a reporter the outside of the facilities.</P>


<P>"'This is a first-of-a-kind plant in the world,'
said Paul Halberstadt, a plant vice president.</P>

<P>"Halberstadt explained visitors would have to dress
in special clothing and heavy boots and take a
safety course to get inside. <span class="bluetext">(((Why not outfit
everybody in the town?)))</span></P>

<P>"In general, though, he explained that turkey waste
is pressure-cooked under extreme heat to produce oil.</P>

<P>"The plant was expected to cost $15 million to build,
a third of it supplied by a federal grant that U.S.
Sen. Kit Bond and Blunt helped obtain.</P>

<P>"But problems with the technology caused design
problems early on. <span class="bluetext">(((Or, alternately, maybe
the "design problems" caused "problems with the
technology.")))</span> The plant had to be rebuilt at a
cost closer to $40 million, with money 
coming from investors and ConAgra.</P>

<P>"The repairs delayed operation until last year.</P>

<P>"'Shame on us,' Appel said. 'We made mistakes.
But we made the commitment to stick in with
more monies.' <span class="bluetext">(((You've gotta admit Mr Appel sounds
lots nicer than Enron or Exxon guys.)))</span></P>

<P>"Those weren't the only projections that were way off.</P>

<P>"Initially, the company predicted the cost to make
the oil would be a bargain &ndash; cheap in fact.</P>

<P>"But today, a barrel of the grade 2 to 6 diesel oil
costs almost $80 to make, Appel said, while the
company buying the experimental oil is paying only
about $40 a barrel under its contract.</P>

<P>"Appel and his colleagues had assumed turkey waste
would cost nothing because they expected the
federal government to put a ban on feeding
animal waste to animals. They estimated that
processing plants would pay them $24 a ton to take
away the offal.</P>

<P>"But that didn't happen, and Appel now is paying
$52 a ton for animal waste, he said. <span class="bluetext">(((See,
it's basically about a crippling shortfall of
turkey guts. And it gets worse, for ornithologists
predict a "Turkey Gut Production Peak" for the year
2012, leading to mass Thanksgiving cancellations and
a "Mad Max" wasteland.)))</span></P>

<P>"Appel also had high hopes that he would get a
$1-a-gallon biofuel tax credit for production costs,
or about $42 per barrel. Congress did pass the tax
credit, but the definition of biofuel excluded
Appel's technology. <span class="bluetext">(((Live by Congress, die by
Congress.)))</span></P>

<P>"In Ireland, Appel said, the losses would be
reversed because processing plants would pay him
to take the waste and the government 
has a tax credit. <span class="bluetext">(((Plus, resurgent Irish
hardliners are eager to field-test "turkey petrol
bombs.")))</span></P>

<P>"Meanwhile, Appel has three proposed plants in
the United States on hold, along with more than
$8 million in federal grants.</P>

<P>"A tax credit and a ban on feeding animal waste
to livestock are needed for the plant to become
profitable, Appel said.</P>

<P>"The Blunt spokesman said there was still a chance
that the plant would get a tax credit.</P>

<P>"'We are exploring that because the energy bill
is still a work in progress,' Wadlington said.
'The congressman would like to find a solution.'</P>

<P>"Creeping odors</P>

<P>"Even if the finances turn around, Appel has to
figure out how to get rid of the overwhelming smell.</P>

<P>"He's spent a $12 million federal grant he received
last year in part trying to fix the problem.</P>

<P>"He promised before the plant was built that it
would be an odor-free operation, and the Carthage
mayor and townsfolk haven't forgotten.</P>

<P>"For more than a year, the smell would creep up
the hill from the plant to the town square and
then envelop the town. <span class="bluetext">(((Poetry is not dead
in American newspaper journalism.)))</span></P>

<P>"Then, in October, it became decidedly worse.</P>

<P>"One day recently, Halberstadt acknowledged that
the smell was really rank, but said the company
was doing everything it could to fix it. 
He showed off the new scrubbers that had been put
in place to reduce odors.</P>

<P>"Residents have complained that the smell makes
them retch. One said he was even afraid to let
the dog go outside.</P>

<P>"Ann Carter, who owns Epicurean Delights, a wine,
cheese and gourmet food store, said the first time
she smelled the odor, she went outside and checked
in the alley to see if something was there.</P>

<P>"'It was worse than a farm smell,' Carter said.
'I figured something had died.' <span class="bluetext">(((Presumably
her deli sells turkey. Those would be 'dead
turkeys,' ma'am. You know, the parts that don't
go on the sandwich.)))</span></P>


<P>"Mayor Kenneth Johnson worries that the town is
getting a bad reputation.</P>

<P>"'This type of publicity isn't going to help
tourism,' Johnson said.</P>

<P>"And on March 18, Blunt, Bond and Sen. Jim Talent
wrote a letter to Doyle Childers, the director of
Missouri Department of Natural Resources, asking
that his agency find the source of the odor.</P>

<P>"'The plant... has great promise, with the hope of
reducing our dependency on foreign oil,' they wrote.
'We do not want this technology to fail.' <span class="bluetext">(((Now
that I think of it, oil-bearing dead dinosaurs were
closely related to turkeys.)))</span></P>

<P>"The Department of Natural Resources has cited
the plant in recent weeks with two violations for
odors and pollution &ndash; two truck trailers were
found spilling blood and water or meat byproducts
onto a roadway. <span class="bluetext">(((There's got to be some kind
of win-win solution here. Maybe they could turn
roadkilled wildlife into oil, too.)))</span></P>

<P>"Childers, who visited the plant two weeks ago,
said he also spoke with Gov. Matt Blunt.</P>

<P>"Childers said odor agents <span class="bluetext">((("odor agents"?)))</span>
are installing new monitoring devices to 
collect data and try to determine where the
smell is coming from. <span class="bluetext">(((I like it that 
this is such a big mystery. Have the crew
of "The X-Files" been alerted?)))</span></P>

<P>"The process should take about 45 days.</P>

<P>"'The governor said he wants this done,' Childers said.
<span class="bluetext">(((Imagine being governor and reading that confidential
'odor-agent' report. "They're burning liquid turkey
guts under high pressure." "Oh.")))</span></P>

<P>"'We don't want to jeopardize a technology that
could eventually be very important to really our
whole country. Everybody said they want 
to work together.'</P>

<P>"Appel blamed a handful of vocal critics in town
for most of the complaints, and said that some of
the smell could be coming from other plants.</P>

<P>"But Appel said he didn't want to make excuses for
the plant's problems.</P>

<P>"'We never built one of these plants and we didn't
know what to expect when we pressed the gas pedal
all the way to the floorboard,' he said."</P>
