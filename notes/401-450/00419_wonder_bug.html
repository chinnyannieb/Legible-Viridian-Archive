<P>"Derek Lovley, a microbiologist at the University
of Massachusetts, discovered Geobacter, a class of
bacteria.  <span class="bluetext">(((Thank you 'Dr. Lovely!')))</span></P>

<P>'Wonderbug' converts waste into power
By Robert S. Boyd<BR>
Knight Ridder Newspapers</P>

<p>"WASHINGTON &ndash; Geobacter, a class of bacteria, is
  tiny and yet so talented that it can turn deadly
  uranium waste into harmless muck, generate electricity
  from rust and garbage, and even run a toy car.
  <span class="bluetext">(((Save us, Geobacter!  Save us, and run our
  little toy cars!)))</span></p>

<P>"It's a lot to expect from an invisible little bug
less than a thousandth of an inch long. But the Energy
Department, the Pentagon and the National Science
Foundation are exploring the potential of Geobacter
and related microorganisms to perform useful work.</P>

<P>"'Geobacter gives us a cheap and simple alternative to
a cleaner, safer environment and the generation of
cleaner forms of energy,' said Derek Lovley, the
biologist who discovered the bacteria in 1987 at the
muddy bottom of the Potomac River in Washington.
<span class="bluetext">(((Where better?)))</span> Lovley heads the Geobacter Project,
a team of 50 researchers based at the University of
Massachusetts in Amherst.</P>

<P>Get a job there!<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.geobacter.org/jobs/">http://www.geobacter.org/jobs/</a><br></P>

<P>Quick, double his grants!<BR>
<A HREF="http://www.geobacter.org/grants.html">http://www.geobacter.org/grants.html</a><br></P>

<P>"So far, 20 species of the Geobacter genus have been
recognized, plus 30 in closely related families.
Scientists have identified the genes of several of
these species and figured out their inner workings.</P>

<P>"The first big job for the clever little microbes is
to help clean up billions of gallons of deadly
radioactive uranium waste left over from the Cold War.
<span class="bluetext">(((Yum!)))</span> This summer is the third year of an Energy
Department test of their abilities at an old uranium
waste field at Rifle, Colo.</P>

<P>"In the test, Geobacter acts like a tiny deliveryman,
<span class="bluetext">(((oh for heaven's sake, get a grip)))</span> shuttling
electrons from atoms in a harmless organic substance,
such as vinegar, to a species of highly radioactive
uranium known as Uranium-6. Compounds containing
Uranium-6 easily dissolve in water, contaminate rivers
and underground aquifers, and sicken or kill fish,
animals and people.</P>

<P>"The addition of two new electrons reduces an atom of
Uranium-6 to a safer version called Uranium-4, a solid
material similar to natural uranium ore. It sinks to
the bottom of the water, where it can be extracted or
left safely in place.</P>

<P>(...)</P>


<P>"To improve the bacteria's performance, researchers
drilled holes in uranium-contaminated ground and
poured vinegar down the holes.</P>

<p>"'It's good food for Geobacter </DT><DD> &ndash; simple and
  inexpensive,' said Lovley. In 24 hours, the number
  of bacteria doubles.  <span class="bluetext">((("Hey man, my uranium-tainted
  groundwater tastes like vinegar!")))</span></p>

<P>"Lovley called this technique 'simpler, cheaper and
more environmentally friendly than the more commonly
used `muck, suck and truck' operations.' This method,
in which contaminants are laboriously dug or pumped up
and transported elsewhere, would take decades and cost
billions of dollars.</P>

<P>If Geobacter passes its tests, the Energy Department
must decide whether and where to begin large-scale
application.</P>

<P>"Public reaction to widespread use of bacteria, like
other genetic experiments, could be hostile.
<span class="bluetext">(((Bacteria are not 'genetic experiments.')))</span> But
Lovley contends that Geobacter is harmless. 'They're
already in the environment,' he said. 'They've shown
no pathogenic (disease-causing) traits. They're
everywhere in almost any soil.'"</P>

<P>"Geobacter also can be used to turn toxic petroleum
byproducts, such as benzene, into inoffensive carbon
dioxide.  <span class="bluetext">((("Inoffensive"?)))</span></P>

<P>"Geobacter's ability to make electricity from rust
is generating interest. <span class="bluetext">(((Yes, one would think so!)))</span>
It removes electrons from one type of iron atom,
known as Fe-2, and converts it into another form,
Fe-3, the basis of ordinary rust. The electrons zip
along a wire, from a positive to a negative pole, as
in a miniature battery.</P>

<P>"Lovley's lab has exploited this bit of energy to
light electric bulbs, operate a calculator and power
a toy car. In the future, he predicted, bacteria power
<span class="bluetext">(((bacteria power to the bacteria people, baby)))</span>
could be used in less developed countries to charge
batteries, run radios, televisions or computers, even
light a small hut.  <span class="bluetext">(((Why is it that people always
try to pipe this half-baked stuff to 'less-developed
countries'?  Appalachia and the South Bronx are 'less
developed,' why don't you try it out there?)))</span> You
might even be able to use it at home to generate
electricity from garbage, he said.</P>

<P>"Although Geobacter generates only tiny amounts of
electricity in the laboratory, it works more
efficiently than the traditional burning of biomass,'
meaning wood, cornstalks, trash and the like.</P>

<P>"Lovley claims his bacteria can recover 80 to 90
percent of the energy potential locked up in iron,
compared with an average of 30 percent of the energy
stored in biomass by traditional means.</P>

<P>"'We're efficient but slow. We're trying to get
efficient but fast,' he joked.  <span class="bluetext">(((Run!)))</span></P>

<P>"The Defense Department also is interested in using
the energy in iron-rich mud at the bottom of the sea
to power submarine detectors and other sensors."
<span class="bluetext">(((The obligatory military app.)))</span></P>
